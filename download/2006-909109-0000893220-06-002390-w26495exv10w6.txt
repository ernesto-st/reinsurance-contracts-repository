     equal installments of $876,250 on June 1, September 1 and December 1 of
     2006 and March 1, 2007.

C.   Within 45 days after the expiration of this Contract, the Company shall
     provide a report to the Reinsurer setting forth the premium due hereunder,
     computed in accordance with paragraph A above, and any additional premium
     due the Reinsurer or return premium due the Company shall be remitted
     promptly.

D.   For each amount of limit reinstated in accordance with the Reinstatement
     Article, the Company agrees to pay additional premium equal to the product
     of the following:

     1.   The percentage of the occurrence limit reinstated (based on the loss
          paid by the Reinsurer); times

     2.   The final adjusted reinsurance premium, as calculated in accordance
          with paragraph A above, for the term of this Contract (exclusive of
          reinstatement premium).

E.   Whenever the Company requests payment by the Reinsurer of any loss
     hereunder, the Company shall submit a statement to the Reinsurer of
     reinstatement premium due the Reinsurer. If the final adjusted reinsurance
     premium for the term of this Contract has not been determined as of the
     date of any such statement, the calculation of reinstatement premium due
     shall be based on the annual deposit premium and shall be readjusted when
     the final adjusted reinsurance premium for the term of this Contract has
     been determined. Any reinstatement premium shown to be due the Reinsurer as
     reflected by any such statement (less prior payments, if any) shall be
     payable by the Company concurrently with payment by the Reinsurer of the
     requested loss. Any return reinstatement premium shown to be due the
     Company shall be remitted by the Reinsurer as promptly as possible after
     receipt and verification of the Company's statement.

F.   In the event a Subscribing Reinsurer's participation in this Contract is
     terminated under the provisions of paragraph B of the Commencement and
     Termination Article, no deposit premium shall be due after the effective
     date of termination, the minimum premium shall be waived, and the
     reinsurance premium and reinstatement premium will be calculated in
     accordance with the following formulas:

     1.   Reinsurance premium shall be the number of days the Subscribing
          Reinsurer participates on this Contract divided by the number of days
          of the original term of this

06\P2Z1057                                                       (BENFIELD LOGO)

          Contract and the quotient thereof shall be multiplied by the
          Subscribing Reinsurer's percentage share of the final adjusted premium
          reported in accordance with paragraph C above.

     2.   Reinstatement premium shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph
          D above and shall be considered fully earned.

     3.   In the event the incurred loss is greater than the sum of the amounts
          from subparagraphs 1 and 2 of this paragraph F, in lieu of the
          provisions of subparagraphs 1 and 2 of this paragraph F, the
          Subscribing Reinsurer will receive premium equal to the lesser of:

          a.   An amount equal to the Subscribing Reinsurer's percentage share
               of the full reinsurance premium calculated in accordance with
               paragraph A (without regard to the termination of the Subscribing
               Reinsurer's share in accordance with the provisions of paragraph
               B of the Commencement and Termination Article) plus any
               reinstatement premium calculated in accordance with paragraph D;
               or

          b.   The Subscribing Reinsurer's percentage share of the incurred
               loss.

G.   "Gross earned premium" as used herein is defined as earned premium of the
     Company for the classes of business reinsured hereunder, before the
     deduction of any premiums ceded by the Company for reinsurance which inures
     to the benefit of this Contract.

ARTICLE VIII - DEFINITIONS

A.   "Ultimate net loss" as used herein is defined as the sum or sums (including
     loss in excess of policy limits, extra contractual obligations and loss
     adjustment expense, as hereinafter defined) paid or payable by the Company
     in settlement of claims and in satisfaction of judgments rendered on
     account of such claims, after deduction of all salvage, all recoveries and
     all claims on inuring insurance or reinsurance, whether collectible or not.
     Nothing herein shall be construed to mean that losses under this Contract
     are not recoverable until the Company's ultimate net loss has been
     ascertained.

B.   "Loss in excess of policy limits" and "extra contractual obligations" as
     used herein shall be defined as follows:

     1.   "Loss in excess of policy limits" shall mean 90.0% of any amount paid

          otherwise within the terms of its policy, such loss in excess of the
          Company's policy limits having been incurred because of, but not
          limited to, failure by the Company to settle within the policy limits
          or by reason of the Company's alleged or actual negligence, fraud or
          bad faith in rejecting an offer of settlement or in the preparation of
          the defense or in the trial of any action against its insured or in
          the preparation or prosecution of an appeal consequent upon such an
          action.

     2.   "Extra contractual obligations" shall mean 90.0% of any punitive,
          exemplary, compensatory or consequential damages paid or payable by

          or actual negligence, fraud or bad faith in rejecting an offer of
          settlement or in the preparation of the defense or in the trial of any
          action against its insured or in the preparation or prosecution of an
          appeal consequent upon such an action. An extra contractual obligation

          date as the loss covered or alleged to be covered under the policy.

     Notwithstanding anything stated herein, the amount included in the ultimate
     net loss for any one loss occurrence as respects loss in excess of policy
     limits and extra contractual obligations shall not exceed 25.0% of the

     Notwithstanding anything stated herein, this Contract shall not apply to
     any loss in excess of policy limits or any extra contractual obligation
     incurred by the Company as a result of any fraudulent and/or criminal act

     settlement of any claim covered hereunder.

C.   "Loss adjustment expense" as used herein shall mean expenses assignable to
     the investigation, appraisal, adjustment, settlement, litigation, defense
     and/or appeal of specific claims, regardless of how such expenses are
     classified for statutory reporting purposes. Loss adjustment expense shall
     include, but not be limited to, declaratory judgments, interest on
     judgments, expenses of outside adjusters, and a pro rata share of the
     salaries and expenses of the Company's field employees according to the
     time occupied adjusting such losses and expenses of the Company's officials
     incurred in connection with the losses, but shall not include office
     expenses or salaries of the Company's regular employees.

     1.   70.5% of $20,000,000 of ultimate net loss arising out of two or more
          loss occurrences during the term of this Contract, as respects
          subparagraph 1 of paragraph B above.

A.   The term "loss occurrence" shall mean the sum of all individual losses
     directly occasioned by any one disaster, accident or loss or series of
     disasters, accidents or losses arising out of one event which occurs within
     the area of one state of the United States or province of Canada and states
     or provinces contiguous thereto and to one another. However, the duration
     and extent of any one "loss occurrence" shall be limited to all individual
     losses sustained by the Company occurring during any period of 168
     consecutive hours arising out of and directly occasioned by the same event,
     except that the term "loss occurrence" shall be further defined as follows:

     1.   As regards windstorm, hail, tornado, hurricane, cyclone, including
          ensuing collapse and water damage, all individual losses sustained by
          the Company occurring during any period of 72 consecutive hours
          arising out of and directly occasioned by the same event. However, the
          event need not be limited to one state or province or states or
          provinces contiguous thereto.

     2.   As regards riot, riot attending a strike, civil commotion, vandalism
          and malicious mischief, all individual losses sustained by the Company
          occurring during any period of 72 consecutive hours within the area of
          one municipality or county and the municipalities or counties
          contiguous thereto arising out of and directly occasioned by the same
          event. The maximum duration of 72 consecutive hours may be extended in
          respect of individual losses which occur beyond such 72 consecutive
          hours during the continued occupation of an insured's premises by
          strikers, provided such occupation commenced during the aforesaid
          period.

     3.   As regards earthquake (the epicenter of which need not necessarily be
          within the territorial confines referred to in the introductory
          portion of this paragraph) and fire following directly occasioned by
          the earthquake, only those individual fire losses which commence
          during the period of 168 consecutive hours may be included in the
          Company's "loss occurrence."

     4.   As regards "freeze," only individual losses directly occasioned by

          fires, irrespective of origin (except as provided in subparagraphs 2
          and 3 above), which spread through trees, grassland or other
          vegetation, all individual losses sustained by the Company which occur
          during any period of 168 consecutive hours within a 50-mile radius of
          any fixed point selected by the Company may be included in the
          Company's "loss occurrence." However, an individual loss subject to
          this subparagraph cannot be included in more than one "loss
          occurrence."

06\P2Z1057                                                       (BENFIELD LOGO)

B.   For all those "loss occurrences," other than those referred to in
     subparagraph 2 of paragraph A above, the Company may choose the date and
     time when any such period of consecutive hours commences, provided that it
     is not earlier than the date and time of the occurrence of the first
     recorded individual loss sustained by the Company arising out of that
     disaster, accident or loss, and provided that only one such period of 168
     consecutive hours shall apply with respect to one event, except for any
     "loss occurrence" referred to in subparagraph 1 of paragraph A above where
     only one such period of 72 consecutive hours shall apply with respect to
     one event, regardless of the duration of the event.

C.   As respects those "loss occurrences" referred to in subparagraph 2 of
     paragraph A above, if the disaster, accident or loss occasioned by the
     event is of greater duration than 72 consecutive hours, then the Company
     may divide that disaster, accident or loss into two or more "loss
     occurrences," provided no two periods overlap and no individual loss is
     included in more than one such period and provided that no period commences
     earlier than the date and time of the occurrence of the first recorded
     individual loss sustained by the Company arising out of that disaster,
     accident or loss.

D.   No individual losses occasioned by an event that would be covered by 72
     hours clauses may be included in any "loss occurrence" claimed under the
     168 hours provision.

ARTICLE XI - LOSS NOTICES AND SETTLEMENTS

A.   Whenever losses sustained by the Company appear likely to result in a claim
     hereunder, the Company shall notify the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer shall
     have the right to participate in the adjustment of such losses at its own
     expense.

B.   All loss settlements made by the Company, provided they are within the
     terms of this Contract and the terms of the Company's policies (except as
     respects loss in excess of policy limits and extra contractual
     obligations), shall be binding upon the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer agrees
     to pay all amounts for which it may be liable upon receipt of reasonable
     evidence of the amount paid (or scheduled to be paid within 14 days) by the
     Company.

ARTICLE XII - SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION

The Reinsurer shall be credited with salvage (i.e., reimbursement obtained or
recovery made by the Company, less the actual cost, excluding salaries of
officials and employees of the Company and sums paid to attorneys as retainer,
of obtaining such reimbursement or making such recovery) on account of claims
and settlements involving reinsurance hereunder. Salvage thereon shall always be
used to reimburse the excess carriers in the reverse order of their priority
according to their participation before being used in any way to reimburse the
Company for its primary loss. The Company hereby agrees to enforce its rights to
salvage or subrogation relating to any loss, a part of which loss was sustained
by the Reinsurer, and to prosecute all claims arising out of such rights.

ARTICLE XIII - FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND

A.   The Company shall provisionally purchase from the FHCF the following limit
     and retention:

          90.0% of $1,598,988 excess of $443,735.

     The provisional limit and retention detailed above may increase or decrease
     depending on the Company's actual written premium subject to the FHCF
     reimbursement coverage during the term of this Contract. The Company and
     the Reinsurer agree to accept and be bound by the final determination of
     the FHCF.

B.   Any loss reimbursement paid or payable to the Company under the FHCF as a
     result of loss occurrences commencing during the term of this Contract
     shall inure to the benefit of this Contract. Further, any FHCF loss
     reimbursement shall be deemed to be paid to the Company in accordance with
     the reimbursement contract between the Company and the State Board of
     Administration of the State of Florida at the full payout level set forth
     therein and will be deemed not to be reduced by any reduction or exhaustion
     of the FHCF's claims paying capacity.

C.   Prior to the determination of the Company's FHCF retention and payout, if
     any, under the reimbursement contract between the Company and the State
     Board of Administration of the State of Florida, the Reinsurer's liability
     hereunder will be determined provisionally based on the projected payout,
     determined in accordance with the provisions of the reimbursement contract.
     Following the FHCF's final determination of the payout under the
     reimbursement contract, the ultimate net loss under this Contract will be
     recalculated. If, as a result of such calculation, the loss to the
     Reinsurer under this Contract in any one loss occurrence is less than the
     amount previously paid by the Reinsurer, the Company shall promptly remit
     the difference to the Reinsurer. If the loss to the Reinsurer in any one
     loss occurrence is greater than the amount previously paid by the
     Reinsurer, the Reinsurer shall promptly remit the difference to the
     Company.

D.   If an FHCF reimbursement amount is based on the Company's losses in more
     than one loss occurrence commencing during the term of this Contract, the
     total FHCF reimbursement received by the Company shall be allocated to
     individual loss occurrences in chronological order of the dates such loss
     occurrences commence, beginning with the first such loss occurrence
     commencing during the term of this Contract, provided that:

     1.   The portion of the total FHCF reimbursement amount to be allocated by
          the Company to any individual loss occurrence shall be equal to the
          lesser of: (a) the amount of FHCF reimbursement to which the Company
          would be entitled for that loss occurrence alone, or (b) the remaining
          FHCF reimbursement which has not been allocated by the Company to
          prior loss occurrences; and

     2.   The total amount allocated by the Company to all such loss occurrences
          shall be equal to the total FHCF reimbursement received by the Company
          for such loss occurrences.

06\P2Z1057                                                       (BENFIELD LOGO)

ARTICLE XIV - OFFSET (BRMA 36D)

The Company and the Reinsurer, each at its option, may offset any balance or
balances, whether on account of premiums, claims and losses, loss expenses or

that in the event of the insolvency of a party hereto, offsets shall only be
allowed in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations.

     case and be subject in all respects to all the general and specific
     stipulations, clauses, waivers and modifications of the Company's policies
     and any endorsements thereon. However, in no event shall this be construed
     in any way to provide coverage outside the terms and conditions set forth
     in this Contract.

B.   Nothing herein shall in any manner create any obligations or establish any
     rights against the Reinsurer in favor of any third party or any persons not
     parties to this Contract.

ARTICLE XVII - NET RETAINED LINES (BRMA 32E)

A.   This Contract applies only to that portion of any policy which the Company

     the amount of any loss hereunder and also in computing the amount or
     amounts in excess of which this Contract attaches, only loss or losses in
     respect of that portion of any policy which the Company retains net for its
     own account shall be included.

B.   The amount of the Reinsurer's liability hereunder in respect of any loss or
     losses shall not be increased by reason of the inability of the Company to
     collect from any other reinsurer(s), whether specific or general, any
     amounts which may have become due from such reinsurer(s), whether such
     inability arises from the insolvency of such other reinsurer(s) or
     otherwise.

ARTICLE XVIII - ERRORS AND OMISSIONS (BRMA 14F)

Inadvertent delays, errors or omissions made in connection with this Contract or
any transaction hereunder shall not relieve either party from any liability
which would have attached had such delay, error or omission not occurred,
provided always that such error or omission is rectified as soon as possible
after discovery.

06\P2Z1057                                                       (BENFIELD LOGO)

     this Contract shall be in United States Dollars.

B.   Amounts paid or received by the Company in any other currency shall be
     converted to United States Dollars at the rate of exchange at the date such
     transaction is entered on the books of the Company.

ARTICLE XX - TAXES (BRMA 50B)

In consideration of the terms under which this Contract is issued, the Company
will not claim a deduction in respect of the premium hereon when making tax
returns, other than income or profits tax returns, to any state or territory of

     Excise Tax the applicable percentage of the premium payable hereon as
     imposed under Section 4371 of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent such
     premium is subject to the Federal Excise Tax.

B.   In the event of any return of premium becoming due hereunder the Reinsurer
     will deduct the applicable percentage from the return premium payable
     hereon and the Company or its agent should take steps to recover the tax
     from the United States Government.

ARTICLE XXII - FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

A.   The Reinsurer agrees to fund, within 30 days of the Company's request,
     subject to receipt of satisfactory information from the Company, its share
     of the Company's ceded outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense
     reserves (including incurred but not reported loss reserves for known loss
     occurrences established by the Company) by:

     1.   Clean, irrevocable and unconditional letters of credit issued and
          confirmed, if confirmation is required by the insurance regulatory
          authorities involved, by a bank or banks meeting the NAIC Securities
          Valuation Office credit standards for issuers of letters of credit and

06\P2Z1057                                                       (BENFIELD LOGO)

<PAGE>

     if the Reinsurer is unauthorized in any state of the United States of
     America or the District of Columbia having jurisdiction over the Company
     and if, without such funding, a penalty would accrue to the Company on any
     financial statement, including but not limited to quarterly filings, it is
     required to file with the insurance regulatory authorities involved.

     The Reinsurer, at its sole option, may fund in other than cash if its
     method of funding is acceptable to the Company and to the insurance
     regulatory authorities involved.

     For the purpose of this Contract, the Lloyd's U.S. Credit for Reinsurance
     Trust Fund shall be considered an acceptable funding instrument.

B.   With regard to funding in whole or in part by letters of credit, it is
     agreed that each letter of credit will be in a form acceptable to insurance
     regulatory authorities involved, will be issued for a term of at least one
     year and will include an "evergreen clause," which automatically extends
     the term for at least one additional year at each expiration date unless
     written notice of non-renewal is given to the Company not less than 30 days
     prior to said expiration date or longer where required by insurance
     regulatory authorities. The Company and the Reinsurer further agree,
     notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Contract, that said
     letters of credit may be drawn upon by the Company or its successors in
     interest at any time, without diminution because of the insolvency of the
     Company or the Reinsurer, but only for one or more of the following
     purposes:

     1.   To reimburse itself for the Reinsurer's share of losses and/or loss
          adjustment expense paid under the terms of policies reinsured
          hereunder, unless paid in cash by the Reinsurer;

     2.   To reimburse itself for the Reinsurer's share of any other amounts
          claimed to be due hereunder, unless paid in cash by the Reinsurer;

     3.   To fund a cash account in an amount equal to the Reinsurer's share of
          ceded outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves (including

ARTICLE XXIII - INSOLVENCY

A.   In the event of the insolvency of one or more of the reinsured companies,
     this reinsurance shall be payable directly to the company or to its
     liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor on the basis of
     the liability of the company without diminution because of the insolvency
     of the company or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or
     statutory successor of the company has failed to pay all or a portion of
     any claim. It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver,
     conservator or statutory successor of the company shall give written notice
     to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the company indicating
     the policy or bond reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability
     on the part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is
     filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership,
     and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate
     such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such
     claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem
     available to the company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or
     statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be
     chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the company as
     part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro
     rata share of the benefit which may accrue to the company solely as a
     result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.

B.   Where two or more reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority
     in interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be
     apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such
     expense had been incurred by the company.

C.   It is further understood and agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of
     one or more of the reinsured companies, the reinsurance under this Contract
     shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the company or to its
     liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, except as provided by Section
     4118(a) of the New York Insurance Law or except (1) where this Contract
     specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the
     insolvency of the company or (2) where the Reinsurer with the consent of
     the direct insured or insureds has assumed such policy obligations of the
     company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such
     policies and in substitution for the obligations of the company to such
     payees.

ARTICLE XXIV - ARBITRATION

A.   As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, any dispute or
     difference between the Company and any Reinsurer relating to the
     interpretation or performance of this Contract, including its formation or
     validity, or any transaction under this Contract, whether arising before or
     after termination, shall be submitted to arbitration.

B.   If more than one reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such
     reinsurers shall constitute and act as one party for purposes of this
     Article provided that communication shall be made by the Company to each of
     the reinsurers constituting the one party, and provided, however, that
     nothing therein shall impair the rights of such reinsurers to assert
     several, rather than joint, defenses or claims, nor be construed as
     changing the liability of the Reinsurer under the terms of this Contract
     from several to joint.

C.   Upon written request of any party, each party shall choose an arbitrator
     and the two chosen shall select a third arbitrator. If either party refuses
     or neglects to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days after receipt of the
     written request for arbitration, the requesting party may appoint a second
     arbitrator. If the two arbitrators fail to agree on the selection of a
     third arbitrator within 30 days of their appointment, the Company shall
     petition the American Arbitration Association to appoint the third
     arbitrator. If the American Arbitration Association fails to appoint the
     third arbitrator within 30 days after it has been requested to do so,
     either party may request a justice of a court of general jurisdiction of
     the state in which the arbitration is to be held to appoint the third
     arbitrator. All arbitrators shall be active or retired officers of
     insurance or reinsurance companies, or Lloyd's London Underwriters, and
     disinterested in the outcome of the arbitration. Each party shall submit
     its case to the arbitrators within 30 days of the appointment of the third
     arbitrator.

D.   The parties hereby waive all objections to the method of selection of the
     arbitrators, it being the intention of both sides that all the arbitrators
     be chosen from those submitted by the parties.

E.   The arbitrators shall have the power to determine all procedural rules for
     the holding of the arbitration including but not limited to inspection of
     documents, examination of witnesses and any other matter relating to the
     conduct of the arbitration. The arbitrators shall interpret this Contract
     as an honorable engagement and not as merely a legal obligation; they are
     relieved of all judicial formalities and may abstain from following the
     strict rules of law. The arbitrators may award interest and costs. Each
     party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall share equally
     with the other party the expenses of the third arbitrator and of the
     arbitration.

F.   The decision in writing of the majority of the arbitrators shall be final
     and binding upon both parties. Judgment may be entered upon the final
     decision of the arbitrators in any court having jurisdiction. The
     arbitration shall take place in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, unless otherwise
     mutually agreed between the Company and the Reinsurer.

G.   This Article shall remain in full force and effect in the event any other
     provision of this Contract shall be found invalid or non-binding.

H.   All time limitations stated in this Article may be amended by mutual
     consent of the parties, and will be amended automatically to the extent
     made necessary by any circumstances beyond the control of the parties.

ARTICLE XXV - SERVICE OF SUIT

(Applicable if the Reinsurer is not domiciled in the United States of America,
and/or is not authorized in any State, Territory or District of the United
States where authorization is required by insurance regulatory authorities. This
Article is not intended to conflict with or override the parties obligations to
arbitrate their disputes in accordance with the Arbitration Article.)

A.   It is agreed that in the event the Reinsurer fails to pay any amount
     claimed to be due hereunder, the Reinsurer, at the request of the Company,
     will submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction within
     the United States. Nothing in this Article constitutes or should be
     understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurer's rights to commence an

     action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to
     remove an action to a United States District Court, or to seek a transfer
     of a case to another court as permitted by the laws of the United States or
     of any state in the United States.

B.   Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the
     United States which makes provision therefor, the Reinsurer hereby
     designates the party named in its Interests and Liabilities Agreement, or
     if no party is named therein, the Superintendent, Commissioner or Director
     of Insurance or other officer specified for that purpose in the statute, or
     his successor or successors in office, as its true and lawful attorney upon
     whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding
     instituted by or on behalf of the Company or any beneficiary hereunder
     arising out of this Contract.

ARTICLE XXVI - AGENCY AGREEMENT

If more than one reinsured company is named as a party to this Contract, the
first named company shall be deemed the agent of the other reinsured companies
for purposes of sending or receiving notices required by the terms and
conditions of this Contract, and for purposes of remitting or receiving any
monies due any party.

ARTICLE XXVII - GOVERNING LAW

This Contract shall be governed as to performance, administration and
interpretation by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania exclusive of the rules
with respect to conflicts of law, except as to rules with respect to credit for
reinsurance in which case the applicable rules of all the states shall apply.

ARTICLE XXVIII - CONFIDENTIALITY

The Reinsurer, except with the express prior written consent of the Company,
shall not directly or indirectly communicate, disclose or divulge to any
unaffiliated third party any knowledge or information that may be acquired
either directly or indirectly as a result of the inspection of the Company's
books, records and papers. The restrictions as outlined in this Article shall
not apply to communication or disclosures that the Reinsurer is required to make
to its statutory auditors, retrocessionaires, legal counsel, arbitrators
involved in any arbitration procedures under this Contract or disclosures
required upon subpoena or other duly-issued order of a court or other
governmental agency or regulatory authority.

ARTICLE XXIX - SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this Contract should be invalid under applicable laws, the
latter shall control but only to the extent of the conflict without affecting
the remaining provisions of this Contract.
