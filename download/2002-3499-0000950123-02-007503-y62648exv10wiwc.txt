                  (b) No Lender is obligated to fund amounts in excess of its
Ratable Share of the Building Loan Amount as set forth on SCHEDULE I, but if the
Building Loan Amount is increased or Agent makes funds available in excess of
the total Building Loan Amount, each Lender shall have the right to elect at its
own discretion whether to provide funds to Agent to fund amounts in excess of
the Building Loan Amount. If and to the extent any Lender shall fund amounts in
excess of the Building Loan Amount for any purpose, such Lender's Ratable Share
of the Building Loan shall be adjusted from time to time based on the total
amounts advanced by all of Lenders from time to time in respect of the Building
Loan.

                  2.1.2 NO REBORROWINGS. Any amount borrowed and repaid
hereunder in respect of the Building Loan may not be reborrowed.

more consolidated, amended and restated building loan notes, made by Borrower to
each Lender in the respective principal amounts of the related Lender's Ratable
Share of the Building Loan, and all of which notes shall collectively be in the
aggregate principal amount of TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($200,000,000)
(collectively, as the same may be amended, supplemented, restated, increased,
extended and consolidated, substituted or replaced from time to time, the
"BUILDING LOAN NOTE") and shall be repaid in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Building Loan Note.

                  2.1.4 USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrower shall use proceeds of the
Building Loan to pay or reimburse itself for Building Loan Costs actually
incurred in connection with the construction of the Improvement if and to the
extent that such Building Loan Costs are reflected in the Building Loan Budget,
subject to reallocation pursuant to Sections 2.1.7 and 4.2.13 (or other
reallocations approved by Agent in its sole discretion).

                  2.1.5 LOAN TERM AND EXTENSION OPTIONS. (a) The term of the

Event of Default exists on the Initial Maturity Date; (iv) Agent shall have
received a date down endorsement to its Title Insurance Policy indicating no
change in the condition of title to the Property from that existing on the
Closing Date (other than Permitted Exceptions) provided that such date down

than the cost of those obtained in connection with Advances, and, otherwise a
title search indicating no change in the condition of title to the Property from
that existing on the Closing Date (other than Permitted Encumbrances) shall be
furnished to Agent; (v) Borrower shall have paid all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses actually incurred by Agent in connection with such extension, including
title search fees (if any) and reasonable legal fees and costs; (vi) Completion
of the Base Building Work shall have occurred; (vii) the Bloomberg Lease and
such additional Leases (which may, but need not, include the H&M Lease) for

of such Qualifying Contracts or Required Release Prices, as applicable, being
contracts with (or Required Release Prices under contracts with) Vornado or any
other Affiliate of Borrower) which in the aggregate total $90,000,000 or,
alternatively, if Borrower elects, subject to Agent's approval (in its
reasonable discretion), to rent the Residential Units or space in the
Residential Component at the Property, Borrower shall have achieved a minimum
weighted average effective rental rate of $50.00 psf pursuant to Leases covering
90% of the Residential Units for which Borrower is required to have obtained
temporary certificates of occupancy on the Initial Maturity Date.

                  (c) In addition, provided that Borrower shall have previously
exercised its option to extend the term of the Loan for the First Extension
Period, Borrower shall have a further option to extend the term of the Loan as
previously extended, until the Second Extended Maturity Date, subject to
satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) Borrower shall have given Agent

                                      -35-
<PAGE>
Prices which in the aggregate total $135,600,000 (of which not less than
$90,000,000 must be represented by Required Release Prices actually received by
Agent) (with not more than 10% of such Qualifying Contracts or Required Release
Prices, as applicable, being contracts with (or Required Release Prices under
contracts with) Vornado or any other Affiliate of Borrower) or, alternatively,
if Borrower elects (subject to Agent's approval, in its reasonable discretion)
to rent the Residential Units or space in the Residential Component at the
Property, Borrower shall have achieved a minimum weighted average effective
rental rate of $50.00 psf pursuant to Leases covering 90% of the Residential
Units for which Borrower is required to have obtained temporary certificates of
occupancy on the First Extended Maturity Date.

                  2.1.6 PRELIMINARY PROJECT REPORT AND BUDGET. A budget, which
details the direct and indirect costs estimated to be incurred by Borrower until
the Property achieves stabilized occupancy (the "PROJECT COST BUDGET"), shall be
prepared by Borrower and delivered to Agent and to the Construction Consultant.
Agent shall require that the Construction Consultant prepare a report for Agent
which documents the Construction Consultant's review conclusions (the
"PRELIMINARY PROJECT REPORT") after reviewing the Project Cost Budget, Plans and
Specifications, Construction Management Agreement, Trade Contracts, Construction
Schedule, Disbursement Schedule, tests and all other reports required by the
Construction Consultant. After reviewing the Preliminary Project Report, Agent
shall approve a detailed budget for the Loan (the "LOAN BUDGET"), which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each category of direct and
indirect cost (the "LINE ITEMS" or "BUDGET LINE") shall be delineated in the
Loan Budget. Those Line Items that are Costs of the Improvement shall be
reflected in a separate column as the Building Loan Budget. Agent and Borrower
acknowledge that the guaranteed maximum price that Borrower obtains from the
Construction Manager shall constitute a single Line Item on the Loan Budget.

                  2.1.7 BUDGET REALLOCATIONS. (a) Subject to the prior approval
of Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Borrower may revise the Loan
Budget from time to time to move amounts available under the Hard Costs Budget
Line denominated "Contingency" to other Hard Costs Budget Lines, and/or to move
amounts available under the Soft Costs Budget Line denominated "Contingency" to
other Soft Costs Budget Lines and/or to move amounts available under the Soft
Costs Budget Line denominated "Contingency" to Hard Costs Budget Lines.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, provided no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower shall have the right to
reallocate, without the prior approval of Agent, up to $7,500,000 of the total
amounts available under the Soft Costs Budget Line denominated "Contingency" to
other Soft Costs Budget Lines.

                  (b) If there is a savings in a particular Budget Line, and if
such savings is substantiated by evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent,
Borrower shall have the right, upon prior approval of Agent, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to reallocate such savings to
another Budget Line with respect to which additional costs have been or may be
incurred; provided, however, that, Borrower shall in no event or under any
circumstances have the right (i) to reallocate any portion of the Interest and
Fees Budget Line(s) without the prior approval of Agent in its sole and absolute
discretion, (ii) to reallocate any savings in a Hard Costs Budget Line to other
than another Hard Costs Budget Line, without in each instance obtaining the
prior approval of Agent, which approval may be withheld in the sole and absolute
discretion of Agent, (iii) to reallocate any savings in a Soft Costs Budget Line
to

                                      -36-
<PAGE>
Budget Line Items on the Project Loan Budget (as defined in the Project Loan
Agreement) or (iv) to cause a reallocation to occur that in the reasonable
opinion of Agent, its counsel or the Title Company contravenes the Lien Law, or
that in the reasonable opinion of Agent, its counsel or the Title Company will
adversely affect or impair in any manner whatsoever the lien or the priority of
lien of the Mortgage.

                  (c) If Borrower becomes aware of any change in Building Loan
Costs which will increase a Line Item of Building Loan Costs reflected on the
Loan Budget, Borrower shall immediately notify Agent in writing and promptly
submit to Agent for its approval a revised Project Costs Budget. Any
reallocation of any Line Item in the Loan Budget in connection with cost
overruns shall be subject to Agent's approval in Agent's sole discretion except
as set forth in Section 2.1.7(a) and (b) above and Section 4.2.13. Lenders shall
have no obligation to make any further Advances for the Building Loan Costs that
constitute the applicable Line Item unless and until the revised Project Cost
Budget and Loan Budget so submitted by Borrower is approved by Agent in
accordance with the terms hereof, and Agent reserves the right to approve or
disapprove any revised Loan Budget in its sole and absolute discretion (except
with respect to reallocations in accordance with Section 2.1.7(a) and (b) above
and Section 4.2.13). Nothing contained in this Section 2.1.7(c) limits
Borrower's obligations under Section 2.1.11.

                  (d) Agent and the Construction Consultant shall use good faith
efforts to respond within seven (7) Business Days after Agent's receipt of
Borrower's written request for approval of any revised Project Cost Budget
together with such proposed revised Project Costs Budget. If Agent fails to
respond to such request within seven (7) Business Days and Borrower sends a
second request (specially marked in accordance with Section 10.6) and Agent
fails to respond to such second request before the expiration of three (3)
Business Days after Agent's receipt of such second request, then such proposed
revised Project Costs Budget shall be deemed to have been consented to or
approved on the terms proposed.

                  2.1.8 ADVANCES. The Building Loan Budget reflects, by category
and line item, the purposes and the amounts for which funds to be advanced by
Lenders under this Agreement are to be used. Lenders shall not be required to
disburse for any category or line item more than the amount specified therefor
in the Building Loan Budget, subject to Sections 2.1.7 and 4.2.13 (or other
reallocations approved by Agent in its sole discretion). No Lender is obligated
to fund amounts in excess of its Ratable Share of the Building Loan Amount, but
if the Building Loan Amount is increased or Agent makes funds available in
excess of the total Building Loan Amount, each Lender shall have the right to
elect at its own discretion whether to provide funds to Agent to fund amounts in
excess of the Building Loan Amount. If and to the extent any Lender shall fund
amounts in excess of the Building Loan Amount for any purpose, such Lender's
Ratable Share of the Building Loan shall be adjusted from time to time based on
the total amounts advanced by all of Lenders from time to time in respect of the
Building Loan.

                  2.1.9 ADVANCES FOR STORED MATERIALS. Lenders shall not be
required to disburse any funds for any materials, machinery or other Personal
Property not yet incorporated into the Improvements (the "STORED MATERIALS"),
unless the following conditions are satisfied:

                  (a) On-Site Stored Materials. Lenders shall make Advances of
the Building Loan in accordance with this Agreement to pay for Hard Costs
actually incurred by Borrower for


                                      -37-
<PAGE>
materials not yet incorporated in the Improvements but stored on site, which
materials are required in connection with the construction of the Improvements,
provided that (i) such materials are in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications accepted by Agent and the Construction Consultant in accordance
with the terms hereof; (ii) such materials are securely stored on site, properly
inventoried, and clearly stenciled or otherwise marked to indicate that they are
the property of Borrower; (iii) the bills of sale and contracts under which such
materials are being provided shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Agent and Construction Consultant; (iv) such materials are
insured against casualty, loss and theft in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
Agent and Agent is named as a named insured and loss payee on such insurance
policy with respect to said materials; (v) Borrower either owns or will, after
the payment of the bills and invoices therefor (which payment in full shall
occur promptly after the disbursement of the Loan for such materials), own such
materials free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, which ownership
shall be established contemporaneously with or promptly after such disbursement
by evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent; (vi) Borrower executes and
delivers to Agent such additional security documents as Agent shall reasonably
deem necessary to create and perfect a first priority lien in the Stored
Materials as additional security for the payment of the Loan; (vii) the
aggregate amount of such disbursements of the Building Loan proceeds for such
materials shall in no event at any time exceed the actual Hard Costs incurred by
Borrower for such materials as verified by Construction Consultant pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement; (viii) the conditions set forth in Section
2.1.9(e) below have been satisfied; and (ix) if required by Agent, the Architect
or the Construction Consultant shall certify that it has inspected such
materials and they are in good condition and suitable for use in connection with
the Project.

                  (b) Off-Site Stored Materials. Lenders shall in no event or
under any circumstances have any obligation to make any disbursement of the
Building Loan for materials which are stored off-site unless the conditions set
forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section 2.1.9 have been satisfied with
respect to the materials stored off-site (other than the requirement of clause
(ii) contained in Section 2.1.9(a) with respect to the storage of materials
on-site) and all such materials covered by any Advance hereunder are stored at a
location, other than the Property, reasonably acceptable to Agent and
Construction Consultant and are (i) stored in a designated and secure area,
conspicuously marked to show that they are the subject of a security interest by
Agent and said stored off-site materials will not be moved except in connection
with their delivery to the Property or to another storage location that conform
with the requirements of this subsection (b); and (ii) effectively segregated
(to the extent reasonably possible) from all other materials of whatever kind
located at the off-site location in question.

                  (c) Finally Assembled, Fully Fabricated Major Building
Materials. (i) Lenders shall from time to time make Advances in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement for the purchase of certain finally assembled, fully
fabricated major building materials, which are ready for delivery to the
Property but are temporarily stored at off-site locations other than the
Property (collectively, "MAJOR BUILDING MATERIALS"), approved by Construction
Consultant prior to the delivery to the Property or incorporation into the
Improvements of such Major Building Materials; provided, however, that in the
case of each such disbursement, the conditions contained in Section 2.1.9(a)
above have been satisfied with respect to the Major Building Materials, other
than the requirement of clause (ii) contained therein with respect to the
storage of such materials on site, and Agent shall have received (A) a written
statement from the

                                      -38-
<PAGE>
manufacturer or storer of such Major Building Materials (or a provision in the
purchase order therefor to such effect) that Agent, Construction Consultant and
either of their agents may fully inspect such Major Building Materials at all
reasonable times and (B) evidence that the conditions set forth in Section
2.1.9(e) below have been satisfied.

                  (ii) Agent shall have the right in its sole discretion, but
         not the obligation, to request that Borrower deliver or cause to be
         delivered to Agent the following documents within five (5) Business
         Days after the date on which any Advance for Major Building Materials
         is made: (A) bills of lading, warehouse receipts, delivery receipts or
         other documents of title with respect to the Major Building Materials
         for which such advance is made, which shall be in form and substance
         reasonably satisfactory to Agent in all respects; (B) a Certificate of
         Borrower in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent in all
         respects to the effect that such Major Building Materials are either
         owned or will be owned by Borrower upon payment of the bills and
         invoices therefor (which payment in full shall occur promptly after
         disbursement of the Advance for such materials) outright, free and
         clear of all Liens, other than liens and security interest in favor of
         Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders, and that Borrower has
         complied with all of the terms of this subsection (c). No advance for
         Major Building Materials shall be made unless the Major Building
         Materials covered thereby are stored at a location, other than the
         Property, acceptable to Agent and Construction Consultant, and are (y)
         stored in a designated and secure area, conspicuously marked to show
         that they are the subject of a security interest by Agent and said
         Major Building Materials will not be moved except in connection with
         their delivery to the Property or to another storage location that
         conforms with the requirements of this subsection (c); and (z)
         effectively segregated (to the extent reasonably possible) from all
         other materials of whatever kind located at the off-site location in
         question.

                  (d) Deposits. Lenders shall make Advances of the Building Loan
in accordance with this Agreement to pay for deposits (collectively,
"PREFABRICATION DEPOSITS") that Borrower is required to post towards materials
not yet fully fabricated (i.e., not ready for installation at the Property or
incorporation into the Improvements) and other materials that are required in
connection with the construction and equipping of the Improvements
(collectively, "PREFABRICATED MATERIALS") but for which title has not yet passed
to Borrower and, accordingly, a perfected security interest cannot be given to
Agent, provided that, the aggregate amount of such disbursements of the Building
Loan proceeds for Prefabrication Deposits shall in no event at any time exceed
$10,000,000 less the aggregate amounts previously paid by Borrower for
Prefabrication Deposits as part of its Required Equity to the extent that the
Prefabricated Materials for which such Prefabrication Deposits were paid by
Borrower as part of its Required Equity are still Prefabricated Materials, (it
being understood that once title has passed to Borrower and the conditions set
forth in Section 2.1.9(a) or (b) or (c) above are satisfied, then the
disbursements of the Loan therefor shall not be applied against the aforesaid
amount for Prefabrication Deposits).

                  (e) Limited Amount. The aggregate amount of such disbursements
of the Building Loan for such materials which are stored on-site together with
any materials which are stored off-site (including, but not limited to, Major
Building Materials) and together with any Prefabricated Materials for which
Prefabrication Deposits for which such disbursements were

                                      -39-
<PAGE>
made and which is outstanding at any given time shall in no event exceed
$50,000,000 less the aggregate amounts previously paid by Borrower for Stored
Materials (including Major Building Materials) and Prefabricated Deposits on
account of Prefabricated Materials as part of its Required Equity to the extent
that such Stored Materials and such Prefabricated Materials have as of the date
of such disbursement not yet been incorporated into the Improvements (it being
understood that once the Stored Materials and/or Major Building Materials and/or
Prefabricated Materials are incorporated into the Project, the cost thereof
shall not be applied to the limit described in this Section 2.1.9(e)).

                  2.1.10 AMOUNT OF ADVANCES. (a) In no event shall any Advance
exceed the full amount of Building Loan Costs theretofore paid or to be paid
with the proceeds of such Advance plus any Building Loan Costs incurred by
Borrower through the date of the Draw Request for such Advance minus (i) with
respect to any such Building Loan Costs that are Hard Costs of construction, the
applicable Retainage for each contract and subcontract and (ii) the aggregate
amount of any Advances previously made by Lenders. It is further understood that
the Retainage described above is intended to provide a contingency fund
protecting Lenders against failure of Borrower or Guarantor to fulfill any
obligations under the Building Loan Documents, and that Lenders may charge
amounts against such Retainage in the event Lenders are required or elect to
expend funds to cure any Default or Event of Default in accordance with the
terms hereof or of any of the other Loan Documents.

                  (b) The Retainage shall be advanced on a contract-by-contract
basis after final completion of all construction work provided for under such
contract, subject to reasonable approval thereof by the Construction Consultant
and receipt by Agent of final lien waiver(s) for said contract.

                  (c) No Advance of the Building Loan by the Lenders shall be
deemed to be an approval or acceptance by the Lenders of any work performed
thereon or the materials furnished with respect thereto.

                  2.1.11 LOAN BALANCING. If at any time Agent notifies Borrower
that, in Agent's sole but reasonable judgment, the undisbursed proceeds of the
Building Loan and Supplemental Loan are insufficient to pay the remaining Hard
Costs and Soft Costs and the undisbursed proceeds of the Project Loan are
insufficient to pay the remaining Project Loan Costs (the amount of such
deficiency being herein referred to as the "SHORTFALL") or, if at any time after
a Casualty or Condemnation shall have occurred, Agent notifies Borrower that, in
Agent's sole but reasonable judgment, the undisbursed proceeds of the Building
Loan and Supplemental Loan together with any Net Proceeds actually received by
Agent and not yet disbursed by Agent for Restoration and together with the
undisbursed proceeds of the Project Loan are insufficient to pay the remaining
Hard Costs and Soft Costs and (with respect to Project Loan proceeds only)
Project Loan Costs to achieve Completion of the Improvements or completion of
the Restoration (as the case may be), then, in any such case, Borrower shall, at
its option, either (i) within ten (10) Business Days of Agent's notification as
aforesaid, deposit with Agent an amount equal to such deficiency, which Agent
shall from time to time apply, or allow Borrower to apply, to such costs; (ii)
pay for such Hard Costs and Soft Costs and, if relevant Project Loan Costs or
costs of Restoration, as incurred, in the amount of such deficiency so that the
amount of the Building Loan and Supplemental Loan which remains to be disbursed
shall be sufficient to pay all remaining Hard Costs and Soft Costs and the
amount of the Project Loan which remains to be disbursed shall be sufficient to
pay

all remaining Project Loan Costs to achieve Completion of the Improvements (and,
if relevant, when added to the amount of any Net Proceeds actually received by
Agent and not yet disbursed by Agent for Restoration, to achieve completion of
the Restoration), and Borrower shall furnish Agent with such evidence thereof as
Agent shall reasonably require; or (iii) post a Letter of Credit in the amount
of such deficiency. Borrower hereby agrees that Agent, for the benefit of
Lenders, shall have a lien on and security interest in any sums deposited
pursuant to clause (i) above and that Borrower shall have no right to withdraw
any such sums except for the payment of the aforesaid costs as approved by
Agent. Agent and Lenders shall have no obligation to make any further advances
of proceeds of the Loan or to disburse any Net Proceeds to Borrower (subject to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Article V hereof
and the corresponding provisions of the Supplemental Loan Agreement and the
Project Loan Agreement, to the extent applicable), until the sums required to be
deposited pursuant to clause (i) above have been deposited, Borrower has
actually paid such Hard Costs and Soft Costs and Project Loan Costs, as the case
may be, (and, if relevant, the costs of Restoration) pursuant to clause (ii)
above, or until Borrower has posted a Letter of Credit pursuant to clause (iii)
above, as the case may be, and, in any such case, the Loan is back "in balance."
Any such sums not used as provided in said clause (i) shall be released to
Borrower when and to the extent that Agent reasonably determines that the amount
thereof is more than the excess, if any, of the total remaining costs of
completion of the Improvements over the undisbursed balance of the Loan,
provided, however, that should an Event of Default occur and be continuing,
Agent shall, at the option of the Majority Lenders, apply such amounts either to
the costs of completion of the Improvements or to the immediate reduction of
outstanding principal and/or interest under the Note.

                  2.1.12 QUALITY OF WORK. No Advance or any portion thereof
shall be made with respect to defective work or to any contractor that has
performed work that is defective and that has not been cured, as confirmed by
the report of the Construction Consultant, but Lenders may disburse all or part
of any Advance before the sum shall become due if Agent believes it advisable to
do so, and all such Advances or parts thereof shall be deemed to have been made
pursuant to this Agreement.

                  2.1.13 REQUIRED EQUITY. All Required Equity shall be
contributed (i.e., expended by Borrower and invested in the Property for
Building Loan Costs and Project Loan Costs or any other approved cost in
connection with the construction of the Improvements) before any Advances other
than the Initial Advance of the Building Loan, or any advances of the
Supplemental Loan or the Project Loan shall be made. Borrower shall not be
deemed to have contributed Required Equity with respect to any expenditures made
by Borrower for Building Loan Costs or Project Loan Costs unless at the time
that Borrower is establishing the amount of its Required Equity Borrower would
have been entitled to an Advance under this Agreement or the corresponding
provisions of the Supplemental Loan Agreement (and a disbursement under the Cash
Collateral Agreement) and the Project Loan Agreement, as the case may be, for
such expenditures (assuming for this purpose only that the requirements of this
Section 2.1.13 and of Section 2.1.11 of this Agreement and the corresponding
provisions, if any, in the Supplemental Loan Agreement, Cash Collateral
Agreement and Project Loan Agreement are satisfied). Agent acknowledges that as
of the Closing Date Borrower has contributed $87,338,207 of the Required Equity.

                  SECTION 2.2 INTEREST RATE.

                  2.2.1 INTEREST.

                  (a) Applicable Interest Rate. The outstanding principal amount
of the Building Loan shall bear interest, as provided below, at the Applicable
Interest Rate from time to time in effect based upon the LIBO Adjusted Rate or
the Base Rate, as Borrower may select as provided below, and Borrower may
convert any portion of the principal amount of the Building Loan from one type
to another as provided herein; provided, that the portion of the principal
amount of the Building Loan converted as aforesaid shall not be less than the
minimum amount set forth in Section 2.2.2.

                  (b) Computation of Interest and Fees. All interest and fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual
number of days elapsed to the relevant Payment Date, including the first day and
excluding the last day (i.e., the relevant Payment Date) and shall be payable in
arrears on the first Business Day of the calendar month immediately following
the Closing Date and, thereafter, monthly on the first Business Day of each
calendar month during the term of the Loan. If a LIBOR Loan or a Base Rate Loan
is repaid on the same day on which it is made one (1) day's interest shall be
paid on such Loan as well as any amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.2.7. Any
change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be effective as of the
day on which such change in rate occurs. Each determination of an interest rate
by Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, interest payable at the Default Rate following an Event of Default
shall be payable from time to time on demand of Agent and in any event, upon the
payment or prepayment of any principal of any portion of the Loan, accrued,
unpaid interest on the principal amount so paid or prepaid shall be due and
payable.

                  (c) Conversion and Continuation Options.

                  (i) Base Rate Loan to LIBOR Loan. Subject to the provisions of
         Section 2.2.2, Borrower may elect pursuant to a Rate Request to convert
         all or any portion of the outstanding Base Rate Loan to LIBOR Loans
         provided that no Loan may be converted to a LIBOR Loan: (i) when any
         Event of Default has occurred under any of the Loan Documents and is
         continuing and Agent has determined that such a conversion is not
         appropriate; or (ii) after the date which is one month prior to the
         Maturity Date.

                  (ii) LIBOR Loan to Base Rate Loan. Borrower may elect pursuant
         to a Rate Request to convert all or any portion of the outstanding
         LIBOR Loans upon the expiration date of its then current Interest
         Period to a Base Rate Loan.

                  (iii) LIBOR Loan to LIBOR Loan. Subject to the provisions of
         Section 2.2.2, any LIBOR Loan may be continued upon the expiration date
         of its then current Interest Period by Borrower pursuant to a Rate
         Request, provided that no LIBOR Loan may be continued: (i) when any
         Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and Agent has
         determined that such a continuation is not appropriate or (ii) after
         the date that is one month prior to the Maturity Date. If Borrower
         fails to submit a Rate Request to Agent in

                                      -42-
<PAGE>
         accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the outstanding LIBOR
         Loan shall automatically be continued as a one month LIBOR Loan unless
         the remaining term of the Loan is less than one month in which case the
         outstanding LIBOR Loan shall automatically be continued as a Bate Rate
         Loan.

                  2.2.2 MINIMUM AMOUNTS AND MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INTEREST PERIODS.
All borrowings, conversions and continuations of the Loan and all selections of
Interest Periods, except for borrowings for interest on the Loan and/or fees and
expenses of Agent and Lenders, shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to
such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal
amount of each LIBOR Loan shall be at least equal to $1,000,000. No more than
six (6) LIBOR Loan Interest Periods and one (1) Base Rate Loan in the aggregate
may be outstanding at any time under this Agreement, the Supplemental Loan
Agreement and the Project Loan Agreement and the Note.

                  2.2.3 CERTAIN NOTICES. Notices by Borrower to Agent of
borrowings hereunder, optional prepayments of the Building Loan, selection of
the duration of Interest Periods, and conversion to or continuation of a LIBOR
Loan or a Base Rate Loan shall be irrevocable and shall be effective only if
received by Agent in writing or telephonically not later than 11:00 a.m. New
York time (and if telephonically, also confirmed in writing by 5:00 p.m. New
York time) on the number of Business Days prior to the date of the relevant
occurrence specified below:

Each notice of optional prepayment shall specify the amount of the Building Loan
to be prepaid, the date of prepayment (which shall be a Business Day) and such
other details as Agent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else to the contrary contained herein, Agent and Lenders shall have the
right to apply any prepayment of the Loan, regardless of how specified by
Borrower, in such order and priority as between the Building Loan, the

                                      -43-
<PAGE>
Supplemental Loan and the Project Loan as Agent shall designate in its sole
discretion. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that it is Agent's and Lenders'
expectation that prepayments shall be applied first in payment of the Project
Loan, then in payment of the Supplemental Loan and, lastly, in payment of the
Building Loan.

                  2.2.4 ADDITIONAL COSTS. (a) If interest is based on a LIBO
Adjusted Rate, Borrower shall pay to Agent from time to time, within ten (10)
days after demand therefor by Agent, such amounts as each Lender may reasonably
determine to be sufficient to compensate such Lender for any costs that such
Lender reasonably determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of
any portion of the Loan as a LIBOR Loan or its obligation to make any portion of
the Loan as a LIBOR Loan hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by
such Lender hereunder in respect of a LIBOR Loan or such obligation (such
increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called
"ADDITIONAL COSTS"), in each case resulting from and limited to the amounts
necessary to compensate each Lender for any Regulatory Change (I) which affects
similarly situated banks or financial institutions generally and is not
applicable to such Lender primarily by reason of such Lender's particular
conduct or condition and (II) which:

                  (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to
         such Lender under this Agreement or the Note (other than Excluded
         Taxes); or

                  (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or
         similar requirements (other than the Reserve Requirement utilized in
         the determination of the LIBO Rate) relating to any extensions of
         credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities
         of, such Lender (including, without limitation, any such deposits
         referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate"), or any commitment of
         such Lender (including, without limitation, the commitment of such
         Lender hereunder); or

                  (iii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or
         the Building Loan Note (or any of such extensions of credit or
         liabilities referred to in subdivision (ii) above).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.2.4,
Additional Costs may be imposed on Borrower by Agent on behalf of each Lender
only if such Additional Costs are generally being imposed by such Lender on
similarly situated borrowers (as reasonably determined by such Lender).

                  (b) Without limiting the effect of the provisions of clause
(a) of this Section 2.2.4 (but without duplication), in the event that, by
reason of any Regulatory Change which affects similarly situated banks or
financial institutions generally and is not applicable to a Lender primarily by
reason of such Lender's particular conduct or condition, any Lender incurs
Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of
the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that
includes deposits by reference to which the LIBO Rate is determined as provided
in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such
Lender that includes the portion of the Building Loan evidenced by such Lender's
Note, then, if such Lender so elects by notice to Agent and Borrower, the
obligation of such Lender to make or continue such portion of the Building Loan
based on the

                                      -44-
<PAGE>
LIBO Adjusted Rate hereunder shall be suspended effective on the last day of the
then current Interest Period, until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in
effect and the portion of the Building Loan evidenced by such Lender's Building
Loan Note shall, during such suspension, bear interest at the Base Rate plus the
Base Rate Margin.

                  (c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.2.4 (but without duplication), Borrower shall pay to each Lender
from time to time on request such amounts as such Lender may reasonably
determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender (or, without duplication,
the bank holding company of which such Lender is a subsidiary) for any costs
that it reasonably determines are attributable to the maintenance by such Lender
(or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company of such Lender),
pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation, directive or request
(whether or not having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority (i)
following any Regulatory Change or (ii) implementing any risk-based capital
guideline or other requirement (whether or not having the force of law) applying
to a class of banks including such Lender, hereafter issued by any government or
governmental or supervisory authority implementing at the national level the
Basle Accord (including, without limitation, the Final Risk-Based Capital
Guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 C.F.R.
Part 208, Appendix A; 12 C.F.R. Part 225, Appendix A) and the Final Risk-Based
Capital Guidelines of the office of the Comptroller of the Currency (12 C.F.R.
Part 3, Appendix A)), of capital in respect of the commitment to lend or the
Ratable Share of the Building Loan of such Lender (such compensation to include,
without limitation, an amount equal to the reduction of the rate of return on
capital of such Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding
company of such Lender) to a level below that which such Lender (or any
Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company of such Lender) would
have achieved but for such increase in capital due to such law, regulation,
interpretation, directive or request), after taking into consideration such
Lender's policies and practices and the policies and practices of such Lender's
holding company with respect to capital adequacy. For purposes of this Section
2.2.4(c), "BASLE ACCORD" shall mean the proposals for risk-based capital
framework described by the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and
Supervisory Practices in its paper entitled "International Convergence of
Capital Measurement and Capital Standards" dated July 1988, as amended, modified
and supplemented and in effect from time to time or any replacement thereof.

                  (d) Each Lender shall notify Agent and Borrower of any event
occurring after the date of this Agreement entitling Lender to compensation
under clause (a) or (c) of this Section 2.2.4 as promptly as practicable, and
shall designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the Loan if such
designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
and will not, in the reasonable opinion of such Lender, be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender. Such Lender shall furnish to Borrower a
certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Lender
for compensation under clause (a) or (c) of this Section 2.2.4. Determinations
and allocations by each Lender for purposes of this Section 2.2.4 of the effect
of any Regulatory Change pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this Section
2.2.4, or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to subsection (c) of this
Section 2.2.4, on its costs or rate of return of maintaining its Ratable Share
of the Building Loan or its obligation to make such Building Loan, or on amounts
receivable by it in respect of the Building Loan, and of the amounts required to
compensate each Lender under this Section 2.2.4, shall constitute prima facie
evidence thereof. Each Lender shall confirm to Borrower at the time

                                      -45-
<PAGE>
it makes any claim under this Section 2.2.4 that the methods of determination
and allocation used by it in determining the amount of such claim are reasonably
consistent with such Lender's treatment of customers similar to Borrower (as
reasonably determined by such Lender). In the event any Lender makes a request
for compensation under subsection (a) or (c) of this Section 2.2.4, Borrower
shall, upon payment of the amount of compensation so requested, have the right
to prepay the Loan in full, without penalty or premium but subject to payment of
all amounts due and payable pursuant to Section 2.2.7, on the last day of any
then current Interest Period with respect to which such compensation has been
requested. Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to
this Section 2.2.4 for any additional costs incurred more than 90 days prior to
the date that such Lender knew of the changes giving rise to such increased
costs and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor under this
Section.

                  2.2.5 LIBO RATE. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any LIBO Adjusted Rate
for any Interest Period,

                  (a) any Lender reasonably determines that quotations of
interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBO
Rate" are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant
maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for any LIBOR Loan as
provided herein; or

                  (b) any Lender reasonably determines that by reason of
circumstances affecting the London interbank market the relevant rates of
interest referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" upon the basis of which
the rate of interest for the LIBOR Loan for such Interest Period is to be
determined are not likely adequately to cover the cost to such Lender of making
or maintaining a LIBOR Loan for such Interest Period;

then such Lender shall give Borrower and Agent prompt notice thereof and, so
long as such condition remains in effect, such Lender shall be under no
obligation to make its Ratable Share of any such LIBOR Loan but shall remain
obligated to make its Ratable Share of a Base Rate Loan for a corresponding
amount, or if any portion of the Loan is already outstanding as a LIBOR Loan,
such portion shall, commencing immediately after the end of the then current
Interest Period, bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin. Each
such Lender shall promptly notify Borrower and Agent upon the cessation of any
facts and circumstances which resulted in suspension under this Section 2.2.5,
whereupon Borrower's right to cause the Building Loan or any portion thereof to
be a LIBOR Loan shall be reinstated.

                  2.2.6 ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its
Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain its
Ratable Share of the Building Loan, then such Lender shall promptly notify
Borrower and Agent thereof and such Lender's obligation to make its Ratable
Share of the Building Loan shall be suspended (provided that, if requested by
Borrower, such Lender's Ratable Share of the Building Loan shall automatically
be converted to a Base Rate Loan if doing so would enable such Lender to
lawfully honor its obligation to make or maintain its Ratable Share of the
Building Loan) until such time as such Lender may again make its Ratable Share
of the Building Loan and Borrower shall, if required by applicable law, upon the
request of such Lender, prepay a portion of the Building Loan equal to the
Ratable Share of such Lender together with accrued interest thereon, but without
compensation to such Lender pursuant

                                      -46-
<PAGE>
to Section 2.2.7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Lender shall, as promptly
as practicable, designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the Loan if
doing so would enable it to lawfully honor its obligation to make or maintain
its Ratable Share of the Loan.

                  2.2.7 BREAKAGE COSTS. (a) Borrower agrees to compensate each
Lender for any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of (a) a default
by Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of a LIBOR
Loan after such Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) a default by Borrower in making any
prepayment of a LIBOR Loan after such Borrower has given a notice thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a
prepayment (mandatory or optional) of a LIBOR Loan for any reason (including,
without limitation, the acceleration of the maturity of the Loan pursuant to
Section 9.1, the payment of Contingent Amortization pursuant to Section 4.1.11
or a prepayment of the Loan in connection with a release of a Residential Unit
pursuant to Section 4.1.37), other than a prepayment of the Loan pursuant to
Section 2.2.6, on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with
respect thereto.

                  (b) Each such Lender will furnish to Borrower a certificate
setting forth the basis and amount of each request by Lender for compensation
under this Section 2.2.7, which certificate shall provide reasonable detail as
to the calculation of such loss, cost or expense. Such certificate shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of such loss, cost or expense,
which shall be calculated by such Lender on a reasonable and customary basis,
consistent with the basis on which such calculations are then being made by
similarly situated banks or financial institutions generally.

                  2.2.8 WITHHOLDING TAXES. Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender
such additional amounts as are necessary in order that the net payment of any
amount due hereunder or under any of the other Building Loan Documents to such
Lender, after deduction for or withholding of any present or future tax imposed
by the United States (subject, in either case, to the provisions of this Section
2.2.8), excluding Excluded Taxes of such Lender, will be the amount that would
be required to be paid hereunder or thereunder in the absence of such deduction
or withholding. Each Lender shall provide Borrower with a form prescribed by the
United States Internal Revenue Service (currently, Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN)
certifying such Lender's exemption from United States withholding taxes with
respect to all payments to be made to such Lender under this Agreement and any
other Building Loan Document at the date of such certificate, and if any Lender
fails to provide Borrower with the prescribed form referred to in the preceding
sentence, indicating that such payments are not subject to United States
withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced to zero by an
applicable tax treaty, Borrower may withhold taxes from payments to or for the
account of such Lender at the applicable statutory rate and shall not be
obligated to pay any additional amounts described

                                      -47-
<PAGE>
in the first sentence of this Section in respect of the Building Loan; provided,
that this sentence shall be inapplicable to such Lender in the event that such
Lender is not able to make the certification set forth in such prescribed form
as a result of a change in United States federal income tax law, regulation or
judicial or administrative interpretation occurring after the date hereof, or of
an amendment, modification or revocation of an applicable tax treaty or a change
in official position regarding the application or interpretation thereof, in
each case, occurring after the date hereof. In the event that Borrower is
obligated to pay any additional amounts described in the first sentence of this
section in respect of the Building Loan, Lender shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office
if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, doing so would eliminate or
reduce Borrower's obligation to pay such additional amounts and would not be
disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  SECTION 2.3 USURY SAVINGS.

                  2.3.1 USURY SAVINGS. This Agreement and the other Building
Loan Documents are subject to the express condition that at no time shall
Borrower be required to pay interest on the principal balance of the Building
Loan at a rate which could subject Lenders to either civil or criminal liability
as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. If by the terms of
this Agreement or the other Building Loan Documents, Borrower is at any time
required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due hereunder at
a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Applicable Interest Rate or the
Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to
the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not on
account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to
Agent or Lenders for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under
the Building Loan, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of
the Building Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest
on account of the Building Loan does not exceed the Maximum Legal Rate from time
to time in effect and applicable to the Building Loan for so long as the
Building Loan is outstanding.

                  SECTION 2.4 LOAN PAYMENTS.

                  2.4.1 PAYMENT BEFORE MATURITY DATE. Borrower shall make a
payment to Agent of interest only at the Interest Rate on each Payment Date
during the term of the Building Loan; each payment to be calculated in the
manner set forth in Section 2.2.1. In addition, if the term of the Loan is
extended in accordance with the provisions hereof, then upon the occurrence of
any Contingent Amortization Trigger Event, Borrower shall make payments of
Contingent Amortization as required pursuant to Section 4.1.11.

                  2.4.2 PAYMENT ON MATURITY DATE. Borrower shall pay to Agent
the outstanding principal balance of the Building Loan, all accrued and unpaid
interest and all other amounts due hereunder and under the Building Loan Note,
the Building Loan Mortgage and the other Building Loan Documents on the Maturity
Date.

                  2.4.3 LATE PAYMENT PREMIUM. If any principal, interest or any
other sum due under the Building Loan Documents is not paid by Borrower within
five (5) days of the date on which it is due (other than the principal payment
due on the Maturity Date), Borrower shall pay to Agent upon demand an amount
equal to the lesser of five percent (5%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum
amount permitted by applicable law in order to defray the expense incurred by
Agent in handling and processing such delinquent payment and to compensate
Lenders for the loss of the use of such delinquent payment. Any such amount
shall be secured by the Building Loan Mortgage and the other Building Loan
Documents.


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

            2.4.4 INTEREST RATE AND PAYMENT AFTER DEFAULT. In the event that,

for such required stage of completion under the Bloomberg Lease and in any event
to permit the Completion of the Base Building Work prior to the Initial Maturity
Date.

            (i) Trade Contracts. No Advance shall be made by Lenders with regard
to work done by or on behalf of any Trade Contractor unless Borrower shall have
delivered to Agent originals of the following documents as to such Trade
Contractor, each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent:

            (i) a fully executed contract reasonably acceptable to Agent;

            (ii) if such Trade Contractor is a Major Trade Contractor, Payment
      and Performance Bonds with dual obligee riders naming Agent (to the extent
      required under the definition of "Payment and Performance Bonds"); and

      Performance Letter substantially in the form attached hereto as SCHEDULE

            (j) Final Plans and Specifications. Agent shall have received and
approved the final Plans and Specifications and other certificates in accordance

all Government Approvals that are then necessary for the construction of the
Improvements as contemplated by the Plans and Specifications have been obtained,
including without limitation, a final and full building permit.

            (m) Construction Consultant Approval. Agent shall have received
advice from the Construction Consultant, reasonably satisfactory to Agent, as to
Construction Consultant's reasonable determination based on on-site inspections
of the Improvements and the data submitted to and reviewed by it as part of
Borrower's Requisition of the value of the labor and materials in place, that
the construction of the Improvements is proceeding reasonably satisfactorily and
that the work on account of which the Advance is sought has been completed in a
good and workmanlike manner to such Consultant's reasonable satisfaction and
substantially in accordance with the Plans and Specifications and according to
schedule so as to (i) avoid Bloomberg having a right to terminate the Bloomberg
Lease for failing to meet the relevant


                                      -58-
<PAGE>
milestone dates thereunder, and (ii) permit Borrower to achieve Completion of
the Base Building Work by the Initial Maturity Date.

            (n) Other Documents. Agent shall have received such other documents
and certificates as Agent or its counsel may reasonably require or as may be
required to be delivered under any Guaranty.

            (o) Series Notes, Mortgages and Assignments of Leases. There shall
have been executed and delivered (i) an amended, restated and consolidated
building loan note payable to Agent (for the ratable benefit of Lenders)
evidencing additional debt of $144,500,000.00 or so much thereof as may be
advanced pursuant to the terms hereof, that by its terms consolidates the same
with the $55,500,000.00 Amended, Restated and Consolidated Building Loan
Mortgage Note delivered at closing, (ii) a second series building loan mortgage
in the principal amount of $144,500,000.00 that by its terms consolidates with
the already recorded $55,500,000.00 Building Loan Mortgage (Series No. 1)
delivered at closing (each such mortgage, sometimes referred to herein as a
"SERIES MORTGAGE") so that there shall be a consolidated first lien on the
Property in an amount equal to the Building Loan Amount, and such second series
mortgage shall be duly recorded and all appropriate mortgage recording taxes and
recording charges in connection therewith shall have been paid. There shall also
have been executed, delivered and recorded an Amended and Restated Building Loan
Assignment of Leases or an amendment to the Building Loan Assignment of Leases
delivered at closing increasing the amount secured thereby to be equal to the
Building Loan Amount.

            (p) Inclusionary Housing Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, if
Certificates of Eligibility for Zoning Bonus for not less than the total Bonus
Area shall not have all been issued and the originals of the same delivered to
Agent together with an assignment of each such Certificate executed in blank and
undated in form reasonably satisfactory to Agent by such time as Borrower begins
to pour the concrete for the Residential Component, Agent and Lenders shall have
no obligation to advance any undisbursed proceeds of the Loan until such time as
such Certificates of Eligibility for Zoning Bonus for not less than the total
Bonus Area shall have all been issued and the originals of the same delivered to
Agent together with an assignment of each such Certificate executed in blank and
undated in form reasonably satisfactory to Agent.

            (q) Guaranteed Maximum Price Contract. The Guaranteed Maximum Price
Contract to be attached to the Construction Management Agreement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, shall have been duly executed and
delivered by the parties thereto and Borrower shall cause the Payment and
Performance Bonds with dual obligee riders naming Agent with respect to the
obligations of Construction Manager under the Construction Management Agreement
(including the Guaranteed Maximum Price Contract that is to be attached
thereto).

            2.9.3 CONDITIONS OF FINAL CONSTRUCTION ADVANCE. In addition to the
conditions set forth in Section 2.9.2 above, Agent's and Lenders' obligation to

reasonably satisfactory to Agent of the Completion of the Base Building Work and
to the extent not previously delivered shall have delivered to Agent Plans and
Specifications for the Basic Residential Buildout Work.

            (b) Approval by Construction Consultant. (i) Agent shall have
received Construction Consultant's advice, reasonably satisfactory to Agent, as
to Construction Consultant's reasonable determination based on on-site
inspections of the Improvements and the data submitted to and reviewed by it as
part of Borrower's Requisition of the value of the labor and materials in place,
and that the work on account of which the Advance is sought has been completed
in a good and workmanlike manner to such Consultant's reasonable satisfaction
substantially in accordance with the Plans and Specifications; and

            (ii) Agent shall have received notification from the Construction
      Consultant that the Completion of the Base Building Work has occurred in
      substantial accordance with the Plans and Specifications (as the same may
      be modified in accordance with Section 4.2.13), all Legal Requirements,
      all Permitted Encumbrances and this Agreement, and that all utilities
      necessary to service the Property (other than connections that Tenants are
      required to make) have been connected and are in operation.

            (c) Certificates. Borrower shall furnish to Agent certificates of
the Construction Manager substantially in the form attached hereto as SCHEDULE

SCHEDULE XVI.

            (d) Final Unconditional Lien Waivers and Release/Payment Receipts.
Borrower shall furnish to Agent Unconditional Final Waivers of Lien and Release
and Payment Receipts in the form set forth in SCHEDULE XII from the Construction
Manager and all Trade Contractors, evidencing that they have been paid in full

            (e) Final Survey. Borrower shall furnish to Agent a final Survey
reasonably acceptable to Agent showing the as-built location of the completed

extent that funds are allocated for the same in the Building Loan Budget and
remain available shall be conditioned as follows:


                                      -60-
<PAGE>
            (a) Basic Residential Buildout Work. Any Advances to be made for
Basic Residential Buildout Work shall be conditioned upon Agent's having
received Plans and Specifications for such work, which shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of Agent and its Construction Consultant, and Agent's
reasonable determination that there are sufficient undisbursed funds allocated
for the same in the Loan Budget to pay for the same after reserving for any
Basic Residential Buildout Work not yet completed at the Property.

            (b) Tenant Improvements and Tenant Allowances. Any Advances to be
made for tenant improvements or tenant allowances shall be conditioned upon (i)
Agent's having received the Lease pursuant to which such improvements are being
made or such tenant allowances are being paid, (ii) to the extent required under
Section 4.1.9, Agent's having approved (or being deemed to have approved) such
Lease, and (iii) such Lease having been fully executed and unconditionally
delivered.

            (c) Leasing Commissions. Any Advance to be made for leasing
commissions shall be conditioned upon (i) Agent's having received the Lease in
respect of which such commissions are being paid, (ii) to the extent required
under Section 4.1.9, Agent's having approved (or being deemed to have approved)
such Lease, (iii) such Lease having been fully executed and unconditionally
delivered and (iv) that no more than one-half of the full commissions payable
under such Lease shall be advanced for prior to the Tenant under such Lease
having accepted delivery of possession under such Lease and commenced occupancy
and the payment of rent under such Lease.

            2.9.5 NO RELIANCE. All conditions and requirements of this Agreement
are for the sole benefit of Agent and Lenders and no other person or party
(including, without limitation, the Construction Consultant, the Construction
Manager, and any Trade Contractors) shall have the right to rely on the
satisfaction of such conditions and requirements by Borrower. Agent shall have
the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to waive any such condition or
requirement.

            SECTION 2.10 BORROWING PROCEDURES.

            2.10.1 DRAW REQUESTS. Borrower shall submit to Agent and the
Construction Consultant a Draw Request (substantially in the forms attached
hereto as SCHEDULES II through IX) ("BORROWER'S REQUISITION") not less than
eight (8) Business Days prior to the date upon which a disbursement of the Loan
is requested (the "BORROWING DATE") and no more frequently than once in each
calendar month (except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 2.10.2). As
part of each Draw Request, Borrower shall submit, as notice of its intention to
borrow funds, a Borrower's Requisition Letter in the form set forth in SCHEDULE
II, which shall be executed by one of the Authorized Representatives. Each
Borrower's Requisition Letter shall be accompanied by: (i) a Borrower's
Requisition Spreadsheet in the form set forth in SCHEDULE IV (it being
understood, however, that once the guaranteed maximum price shall have been
approved by Lender as herein provided, Borrower shall be required to show on
such Spreadsheet only a single Budget Line for Hard Costs); (ii) a completed
Application and Certificate for Payment (AIA Document G702) attached hereto as
SCHEDULE VI that is executed by the Construction Manager and Architect; (iii) a
Borrowing Certificate in the form set forth in SCHEDULE VIII; (iv) Payment
Receipts in the form set forth in SCHEDULE IX from


                                      -61-
<PAGE>
the Construction Manager and Trade Contractors, evidencing that they have been
paid in full for all work performed and/or materials supplied to the date of the
preceding advance, except for Retainage provided for in this Agreement; (v) at
the request of Agent, current requisitions for payment from Trade Contractors
and/or any of their subcontractors allocable to the Improvements; (vi) such
other information and documents as may be reasonably requested or required by
Agent or the Construction Consultant with respect to the Hard Costs covered by
such Draw Request; and (vii) invoices, statements or such other information and
documentation as Agent shall reasonably request or require with respect to any
Soft Costs covered by such Draw Request. All such requests and requisitions for
payment shall have been approved by Borrower and, with respect to Hard Costs,
recommended for payment by the Construction Consultant.

            2.10.2 ONE ADVANCE PER MONTH. Agent and Lenders shall have no
obligation to make Advances of the Loan more often than once in each calendar
month except that Agent, in its sole discretion, shall have the right but not
the obligation, to make and to require the Lenders to make additional advances
per month for interest, fees and expenses due under the Loan Documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent and Lenders agree to make more frequent
Advances to pay for the following Hard Costs: steel and any other Hard Costs for
which Borrower reasonably requests more than one advance per month, provided
that for each additional Advance during any calendar month, Borrower shall pay
to Agent an additional administration fee of $2,000 (in addition to the
Administrative Fee payable to Agent for such month pursuant to the Loan Fee
Letter), and provided further that in no event shall Agent and Lenders have any
obligation to make advances of the Loan more than twice in each calendar month.

            2.10.3 ADVANCES TO PAY INTEREST, FEES AND EXPENSES. Borrower hereby
requests that Agent and Lenders make an Advance on each (i) Payment Date to pay
interest due at such time; (ii) Fee Payment Date to pay fees under the Loan
Documents that are then due to Agent, Lenders and/or Construction Consultant, as
applicable; and (iii) Borrowing Date to pay expenses and other reimbursables
under the Loan Documents that are then due and payable hereunder in accordance
with the terms hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (A) all positive Net Cash Flow (excluding Net Sales Proceeds)
from the Property, to the extent that Agent determines that it is sufficient and
available to pay for such interest and fees, shall be used to for the same
before proceeds of the Building Loan are disbursed for such purposes, (B) the
amounts otherwise to be funded by Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.10.3 for
interest on the Building Loan shall be reduced by any payments received under
the Interest Rate Protection Agreement and (C) Lenders shall have no obligation
to make any such disbursement for interest or fees unless the conditions set
forth in Section 2.9.2(c) are satisfied and no material Default and no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Neither the provisions of this
Section 2.10.3 nor the provisions of Section 2.8 are intended to limit or
derogate from Borrower's and Guarantor's absolute and unconditional obligation
to pay such interest and fees regardless of whether Loan proceeds are available
or advanced therefor to the extent (if any) provided in the applicable
Guaranties.

            2.10.4 PROCEDURE OF ADVANCES. (a) Each Draw Request shall be
submitted to Agent and the Construction Consultant at least eight (8) Business
Days prior to the Borrowing Date for the requested Advance, and no more
frequently than monthly except as otherwise provided in Section 2.10.2. Not less
than three (3) London Business Days prior to the Borrowing


                                      -62-
<PAGE>
Date, Agent shall deliver written notice to each Lender at the address specified
by each Lender from time to time which notice shall include the Borrowing Date
and such Lender's Ratable Share of such Advance. Agent shall include with such
notice a copy of the Draw Request, to the extent not previously delivered and to
the extent in Agent's possession, and Agent shall promptly deliver to each
Lender all items in respect of such Advance received by Agent after the date of
such notice. Lenders shall make the requested Advance on the Borrowing Date so
long as all conditions to such Advance are satisfied or waived. Unless otherwise
notified by Agent, each Lender may assume that all conditions to such Advance
are satisfied or waived on the Borrowing Date.

            (b) Not later than 11:00 a.m. New York City time, on the Borrowing
Date, each Lender shall make available for the account of Agent at its address
referred to in Section 10.6, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of
such Advance. After Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
applicable conditions in Article II, Agent will make such funds available to
Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.10.

            (c) Unless Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to
the Borrowing Date that such Lender will not make available to Agent such
Lender's ratable portion of such Advance, Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such portion available to Agent on the Borrowing Date in accordance with
Section 2.10.4(b), and Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to Borrower on the Borrowing Date a corresponding amount. If and to
the extent that any of Lenders (the "DEFAULTING LENDER") shall not have so made
such ratable portion available to Agent (individually, a "DEFICIENCY," and
collectively, "DEFICIENCIES"), and Agent has advanced such amount to Borrower,
such Defaulting Lender agrees to repay to Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to Borrower until the date such amount is repaid
to Agent at the Default Rate. If such Defaulting Lender shall repay to Agent
such corresponding amount, such amount (excluding interest) so repaid shall
constitute such Defaulting Lender's ratable portion of the Advance. Each of the
Lenders agrees that Borrower or any of the other Lenders shall have the right to
proceed directly against any Defaulting Lender in respect of any right or claim
arising out of the default of such Defaulting Lender hereunder. If there shall
be a Deficiency in respect of any Lender, the other Lenders, or any of them,
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to advance all or any part of the
ratable portion of an Advance that should have been made by the Defaulting
Lender, and the Defaulting Lender agrees to repay upon demand to each of the
Lenders who has advanced a portion of the Deficiency the amount advanced on
behalf of the Defaulting Lender, together with interest thereon at the Default
Rate. If more than one Lender elects to advance a portion of the Deficiency such
Lenders' advances shall be made based on the relative Ratable Shares of the Loan
of each advancing Lender or as otherwise agreed to by such Lenders. In the event
the Defaulting Lender fails to advance or repay the Deficiency (with interest at
the Default Rate, if applicable) on or prior to the date of the next succeeding
Advance, the entire interest of said Defaulting Lender in the Loan shall be
subordinate to the interests of the other Lenders and all payments otherwise
payable to the Defaulting Lender shall be used to advance or repay the
Deficiency, as applicable, until such time such Defaulting Lender advances or
repays all Deficiencies (including interest at the Default Rate, if applicable)
and Borrower or Agent shall have the right to require such Defaulting Lender to
assign its interest in the Loan to an Eligible Institution or other assignee
satisfactory to Agent in its sole discretion (subject, nevertheless, to Section
10.24).


                                      -63-
<PAGE>
            (d) The failure of any Lender to pay any Deficiency shall not
relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its
ratable portion of the Advance on the Borrowing Date, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any Lender to make its ratable portion of the
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the Borrowing Date; provided,
however, that Lenders shall be obligated to fund the balance or the then current
Advance (i.e., excluding the Deficiency) in the manner required hereunder. In
the event the following occurs, Lenders, in the sole discretion of Agent, shall
have the right to make no further Advances under the Loan: any and all
Deficiencies in respect of prior Advances made more than thirty (30) days prior
to the current Advance have not been funded by (A) the Defaulting Lender(s)
responsible therefor or (B) one or more of the other Lenders or (C) Borrower
with its own equity. In such event, the Building Loan Amount shall be
permanently reduced by any and all Deficiencies unless and until funded as
provided in clauses (A) or (B) above or a substitute lender, reasonably
acceptable to Lenders other than the Defaulting Lender(s), pays such
Deficiency(ies). If pursuant to this Section, Lenders are not obligated to make
an Advance, Agent may (subject to subsection (e) below) nonetheless make a
determination that Lenders shall make such Advances and all Lenders shall be
bound by such determination.

            (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any decision by Agent to make
Advances hereunder when Borrower is not entitled to receive such an Advance
because an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and any decision by
Agent to refuse to make any Advance hereunder because an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing shall be a Major Decision requiring the consent of
all Lenders.

            (f) If included in a Borrower's Requisition, Agent will make an
Advance directly into the imprest account of the Construction Manager in
accordance with the provisions of the Construction Management Agreement
provided, at no time, shall the outstanding unapplied balance in such imprest
account exceed $4,000,000.

            2.10.5 FUNDS ADVANCED. Each Advance shall be made by Agent by wire
transfer to Borrower's Designated Account or as provided in Section 2.10.6. All
proceeds of all Advances shall be used by Borrower only for the purposes for
which such Advances were made. Borrower shall not commingle such funds with
other funds of Borrower.

            2.10.6 DIRECT ADVANCES TO THIRD PARTIES. At Agent's option, Agent
may direct Lenders to make any or all Advances directly or through the Title
Company to (i) Construction Manager or any Trade Contractor for construction
expenses which shall theretofore have been approved by Agent and for which
Borrower shall have failed to make payment, provided that Agent shall not so
direct Lenders to make such Advances directly to any such Persons without
Borrower's prior consent unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, (ii) Borrower's Architect to pay its fees to the extent funds are
allocated thereto in the Building Loan Budget (subject to reallocation as
provided herein), (iii) the Construction Consultant to pay its fees in
accordance with the terms hereof, (iv) Agent's counsel to pay its fees in
accordance with the terms hereof, provided that Borrower shall theretofore have
received notice from Agent or such Lender that such fees have been incurred and
Borrower shall have failed to reimburse such Lender for such fees beyond any
grace periods provided for said reimbursement under the Building Loan Note, this
Agreement or any of the other Building Loan Documents, (v) each Lender to pay
(x) any installment of interest due under the Building Loan Note, (y) any
expenses


                                      -64-
<PAGE>
incurred by such Lender which are reimbursable by Borrower under the Building
Loan Documents (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and other fees and expenses incurred by
such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof), provided that Borrower shall
theretofore have received notice from Agent or such Lender that such expenses
have been incurred and Borrower shall have failed to reimburse such Lender for
such expenses beyond any grace periods provided for said reimbursement under the
Building Loan Note, this Agreement or any of the other Building Loan Documents,
or (z) following an Event of Default, any other sums due to any Lender under the
Building Loan Note, this Agreement or any of the other Building Loan Documents,
all to the extent that the same are not paid by the respective due dates
thereof, and in each case subject to the approval of Agent, (vi) any other
Person to whom Agent in good faith determines payment is due and for which
Borrower shall have failed to make payment, provided that Agent shall not so
direct Lenders to make such Advances directly to any such Persons without
Borrower's prior consent unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; and any portion of the Building Loan so disbursed by Lenders shall
be deemed disbursed as of the date on which the Person to whom payment is made
receives the same. Agent shall give each Lender not less than three (3) London
Business Days' Notice of the amount of interest due each Lender on each interest
due date, which notice shall include the Interest Period(s), and the portion of
the Building Loan which relates thereto and the Applicable Interest Rate for
each Interest Period; and (vii) to Vornado pursuant to the Guaranty of
Completion. The execution of this Agreement by Borrower shall, and hereby does,
constitute an irrevocable authorization so to advance the proceeds of the
Building Loan directly or through the Title Company to such Persons in
accordance with this Section 2.10.6 as amounts become due and payable to them
hereunder and any portion of the Building Loan so disbursed by Lenders shall be
deemed disbursed as of the date on which the Person to whom payment is made
receives the same. No further authorization from Borrower shall be necessary to
warrant such direct Advances to such relevant Person, and all such Advances
shall satisfy pro tanto the obligations of Lenders hereunder and shall be
secured by the Building Loan Mortgage and the other Building Loan Documents as
fully as if made directly to Borrower.

            2.10.7 ADVANCES DURING EXTENSION PERIODS. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Lenders shall have no obligation to make any
Advance during the Extension Periods, except for (a) interest on the Building
Loan, (b) tenant improvements and leasing commissions in respect of approved
Leases, (c) punch list items in respect of the Base Building Work, if funds
allocated in the Building Loan Budget remain available to be advanced under this
Agreement for such purposes and subject to all the conditions to Advances
therefor, including, without limitation, Section 2.1.11 and (d) Basic
Residential Buildout Work, if funds allocated in the Building Loan Budget remain
available to be advanced under this Agreement for such purposes and subject to
all the conditions to Advances therefor, including, without limitation, Section
2.1.11. Lenders will also continue to make Advances available to Borrower during
the First Extension Period to pay for costs reflected on the Building Loan
Budget incurred by Borrower prior to the Initial Maturity Date in connection
with the Base Building Work provided that the foregoing is not intended to limit
Borrower's obligation to achieve Completion of the Base Building Work by the
Initial Maturity Date.

            2.10.8 ADVANCES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER. No Advance shall
constitute a waiver of any of the conditions of Lenders' obligation to make
further Advances nor, in the


                                      -65-
<PAGE>
event Borrower is unable to satisfy any such condition, shall any Advance have
the effect of precluding Agent from thereafter declaring such inability to be an
Event of Default hereunder.

            2.10.9 TRUST FUND PROVISIONS. All proceeds advanced hereunder shall
be subject to the trust fund provisions of Section 13 of the Lien Law. The
affidavit attached hereto as EXHIBIT F is made pursuant to and in compliance
with Section 22 of the Lien Law, and, if so indicated in said affidavit,
Building Loan proceeds will be used, in part, for reimbursement for payments
made by Borrower prior to the Initial Advance hereunder but subsequent to the
commencement of the construction and equipping of the Improvements for items
constituting Costs of the Improvement.

            2.10.10 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            2.10.11 ADVANCES AND DISBURSEMENTS UNDER COMPLETION GUARANTY.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any
other Loan Document, Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally authorizes
Agent and Lenders to make any disbursements of proceeds of the Building Loan in
accordance with the Guaranty of Completion. Borrower agrees that (i) any such
disbursement of Building Loan Proceeds to Vornado shall be secured by the
Building Loan Mortgage and shall constitute part of the Debt, and (ii) Vornado
shall have the right to exercise all of the rights of Borrower hereunder
(including, without limitation, the right to make requests for Advances, to
satisfy conditions precedent thereto, to make change orders, and to re-allocate
Line Items on the Budget in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Guaranty of Completion).

            III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            SECTION 3.1 BORROWER REPRESENTATIONS.

            Borrower represents and warrants that:

            3.1.1 ORGANIZATION. Borrower is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing with full power and authority to own its assets and conduct its
business and is duly qualified in all jurisdictions in which the ownership or
lease of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification. Borrower has taken all necessary action to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents by it, and has the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and all the transactions
contemplated hereby.

            3.1.2 PROCEEDINGS. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents have
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Borrower and constitute a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Borrower, enforceable against Borrower in
accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law).


                                      -66-
<PAGE>
            3.1.3 NO CONFLICTS. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents by Borrower and the performance of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder will not conflict with any provision of any law or
regulation to which Borrower is subject, or conflict with, result in a breach
of, or constitute a default under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any of Borrower's organizational documents or any agreement or instrument to
which Borrower is a party or by which it is bound, or any order or decree
applicable to Borrower, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien on
any of Borrower's assets or property (other than pursuant to the Loan
Documents).

            3.1.4 LITIGATION. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to Borrower's knowledge, threatened against Borrower
and/or Guarantor in any court or by or before any other Governmental Authority,

aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (i) materially and adversely affect
the ability of Borrower to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) materially and adversely affect the value of the Property, (iii)
impair in any material respect the use and operation of the Property or (iv)
impair in any material respect Borrower's and/or Guarantor's ability to pay its

            3.1.5 GOVERNMENTAL ORDERS. Borrower is not in default with respect
to any order or decree of any court or any order, regulation or demand of any
Governmental Authority, which default would be reasonably expected to have
consequences that would materially and adversely affect the condition (financial
or other) or operations of Borrower or its properties or would be reasonably
expected to have consequences that would materially and adversely affect its
performance hereunder.

            3.1.6 CONSENTS. No consent, approval, authorization or order of any
court or Governmental Authority or other Person is required for the execution,
delivery and performance by Borrower of, or compliance by Borrower with, this

            3.1.7 TITLE. Borrower has good, marketable and insurable fee simple

balance of the Property, free and clear of all Liens whatsoever except the
Permitted Encumbrances and except for any filed mechanics liens (if any) that
are being bonded or otherwise paid or discharged of record within the period of
time permitted therefor under the Building Loan Mortgage. The Building Loan
Mortgage, when properly recorded in the appropriate records, together with the
Building Loan Agreement when properly filed in the appropriate records and any
Uniform Commercial Code financing statements required to be filed in connection
therewith, will create (i) a valid, first priority, perfected lien on the
Property, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and (ii) perfected security
interests in and to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all personalty

subject only to any Permitted Encumbrances. There are no mechanics',
materialman's or other similar liens or claims which have been filed for work,
labor or materials affecting the Property which are or may be liens prior to, or
equal or coordinate with, the lien of the Mortgage. None of the Permitted
Encumbrances, individually or


                                      -67-
<PAGE>
in the aggregate, materially interfere with the benefits of the security
intended to be provided by the Mortgage and this Agreement, materially and
adversely affect the value of the Property, impair the use or operations of the
Property or impair Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under the
Building Loan Documents in a timely manner. Notwithstanding anything herein
contained to the contrary, the warranty of title to the Property hereinabove set
forth shall be for the benefit of Agent, the Lenders, and their successors and
assigns and not the Title Company.

3.1.9 COMPLIANCE.
Borrower and the Property and the use thereof comply in all material respects
with all applicable Legal Requirements, including, without limitation, land use
and building and zoning ordinances and codes. Borrower is not in default or
violation of any order, writ, injunction, decree or demand of any Governmental
Authority, the violation of which would be reasonably expected to materially
adversely affect the condition (financial or otherwise) or business of Borrower.
Borrower has not committed any act which may give any Governmental Authority the
right to cause Borrower to forfeit the Property or any part thereof or any
monies paid in performance of Borrower's obligations under any of the Loan
Documents. Subject to Borrower's obtaining the necessary Certificates of
Eligibility for Zoning Bonus for the Additional Development Rights, all
necessary action required to be taken as of the date this representation is
being made or deemed remade has been taken to permit construction of the
Improvements according to the Plans and Specifications and full use of the
Improvements for their intended purpose under applicable Legal Requirements,
except, with respect to use of the Improvements, for the absence of a
certificate of occupancy prior to the completion of the Improvements. Subject to
the need for Borrower to obtain the necessary Certificates of Eligibility for
Zoning Bonus for the Additional Development Rights, Borrower, has all necessary
certificates, licenses, authorizations, registrations, permits and/or approvals
that are now necessary for the construction of the Improvements or any part
thereof in accordance with the Plans and Specifications or the commencement or
continuance of construction thereon, as the case may be, including but not
limited to, where appropriate, all required environmental permits, all of which
as of the date of the signing hereof are in full force and effect and not, to
the knowledge of Borrower, subject to any revocation, amendment, release,
suspension, forfeiture or the like. Borrower has obtained all Governmental
Approvals from, and has given all such notices to, and has taken all such other
actions with respect to such Governmental Authority as may be required under
applicable Legal Requirements for the construction of the Improvements that is

the Property or (iii) the ability of either Guarantor to perform its respective
obligations under the applicable Guaranty.

respect of the Property (i) are true, complete and correct in all material
respects, (ii) accurately represent the financial condition of the Property as
of the date of such reports, and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP throughout the periods covered, except as disclosed therein. Borrower does

commitments that are known to Borrower and reasonably likely to have a
materially adverse effect on the Property or the operation thereof, except as
referred to or reflected in said financial statements. Since the date of the
financial statements, there has been no material adverse change in the financial
condition, operations or business of Borrower or the Property from that set
forth in said financial statements. All documents furnished to Agent by or on
behalf of Borrower, as part of or in support of the Loan application or pursuant
to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, are true, correct,
complete in all material respects and accurately represent the matters to which
they pertain as of the dates made and there have been no materially adverse
changes with respect to such matters since the respective dates thereof.

            3.1.11 CONDEMNATION. No Condemnation or other similar proceeding has

            3.1.12 UTILITIES AND PUBLIC ACCESS. The Property has rights of
access to public ways and is served or will be served by water, sewer, sanitary
sewer and storm drain facilities adequate for the construction, development and
operation of the Property for its intended uses. All roads and streets necessary

purpose have been completed and with respect to all roads and streets, the
necessary rights of way therefor have either been acquired by the appropriate

Local Authority allowing for the construction, use and operation of, and access
to the Improvements.

parcels that constitute separate tax lots and do not constitute a portion of any
other tax lot not a part of the Property.

            3.1.14 ASSESSMENTS. There are no pending or proposed special or
other assessments for public improvements or otherwise affecting the Property,
nor are there any contemplated improvements to the Property that may result in
such special or other assessments that would, individually or in the aggregate,
would have a material and adverse effect on (i) the ability of Borrower to
perform its obligations under the Loan Documents, (ii) the Property or (iii) the
ability of either Guarantor to perform its respective obligations under the
applicable Guaranty.

            3.1.15 ENFORCEABILITY. The Building Loan Documents are not subject
to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense by Borrower,
including the defense of usury, nor would the operation of any of the terms of
the Building Loan Documents, or the exercise of


                                      -69-
<PAGE>
any right thereunder, render the Building Loan Documents unenforceable, and
Borrower has not asserted any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or
defense with respect thereto.

            3.1.16 ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES. The Assignment of Leases creates a
valid assignment of, or a valid security interest in, certain rights under the
related Leases, subject only to a license granted to Borrower to exercise
certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such
Leases, including the right to operate the Property. No Person other than Agent
(on behalf of Lenders) has any interest in or assignment of the Leases or any
portion of the Rents due and payable or to become due and payable thereunder.

            3.1.17 INSURANCE. Borrower has obtained and has delivered to Agent
original or certified copies of all of the Policies (or Accord 27 certificates
reasonably satisfactory to Agent evidencing the existence of the same), with all
premiums prepaid thereunder, reflecting the insurance coverages, amounts and
other requirements set forth in this Agreement. Any claim that Borrower has
heretofore made under any of the Policies does not have a material and adverse
effect on (i) the effectiveness of the Policies, (ii) the ability of Borrower to
perform its obligations under the Loan Documents, (iii) the Property or (iv) the
ability of either Guarantor to perform its respective obligations under the
applicable Guaranty. No Person, including Borrower, has done, by act or
omission, anything that would impair the coverage of any of the Policies.

            3.1.18 LICENSES. All permits and approvals, including without
limitation, building permits required by any Governmental Authority for the
current construction of the Improvements in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications and the use, occupancy and operation of the Property in the
manner in which the Property is currently being used, occupied and operated have
been obtained and are in full force and effect, except, with respect to use of
the Improvements, for the absence of a certificate of occupancy prior to the
completion of the Improvements and except for Certificate(s) of Eligibility for
Zoning Bonus for the Additional Development Rights.

            3.1.19 FLOOD ZONE. None of the Improvements on the Property are
located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a
special flood hazard area.

            3.1.20 PHYSICAL CONDITION. Neither the Property nor any portion
thereof is now damaged or injured as result of any fire, explosion, accident,
flood or other casualty, the result of which is to preclude Borrower from being
entitled to (i) the applicable Advance under the terms of this Agreement or (ii)
the disbursement of Net Proceeds in respect thereof. There are no proceedings
pending, or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, threatened, to acquire by
power of condemnation or eminent domain, the Property, or any interest therein,
or to enjoin or similarly prevent the construction or use of the Improvements.
Borrower has not received notice from any insurance company or bonding company
of any defects or inadequacies in the Property, or any part thereof, which would
adversely affect the insurability of the same in accordance with the terms
hereof or cause the imposition of extraordinary premiums or charges thereon that
Borrower does not have the ability to pay or of any termination or threatened
termination of any policy of insurance or bond that is not replaced by Borrower.

Property lie wholly within the boundaries and building restriction lines of the
Property, and no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the
Property, and no easements or other encumbrances affecting the Property encroach
upon any of the improvements, so as to affect the value or marketability of the
Property except in each case those which are insured against by title insurance
or otherwise constitute Permitted Encumbrances.

            3.1.22 LEASES. With respect to any existing Leases that: (a) the
rent roll most recently delivered to Agent pursuant to Section 4.1.6 is true,

abatements required to be given by Borrower to any Tenant as of the date that

            3.1.23 FILING AND RECORDING TAXES. All transfer taxes, deed stamps,
intangible taxes or other amounts in the nature of transfer taxes required to be
paid under applicable Legal Requirements in connection with the transfer of the
Property to Borrower have been paid. All mortgage, mortgage recording, stamp,

Requirements in connection with the execution, delivery, recordation, filing,
registration, perfection or enforcement of any of the Building Loan Documents,

the Building Loan Mortgage.

financial records and bank accounts of any other


                                      -71-
<PAGE>
Person; provided that it may have a joint bank account with the other Borrower

accounts in a manner so that it will not be difficult or costly to segregate,
ascertain and otherwise identify the assets and liabilities of Borrower.

            (e) Borrower will not commingle any of its assets, funds,
liabilities or business functions with the assets, funds, liabilities or
business functions of any other Person (other than (i) the other Borrower (A) as
co-borrower under the Loan and (B) as co-obligor under the Alexander's

            (ee) Borrower will cause transactions and agreements between
Borrower, on the one hand, and any one or more of its Affiliates, on the other

            (ff) Borrower will cause the pricing and other material terms of all
transactions and agreements described in the immediately preceding clause (ee)

            (gg) Borrower will not acquire or assume the obligations of its
Affiliates (other than (i) the other Borrower (A) as co-borrower under the Loan
and (B) as co-obligor to Alexander's under the Alexander's Reimbursement
Agreement for the reimbursement of


                                      -74-
<PAGE>
payments under the Guaranties and (ii) Alexander's and the other Borrower as
co-obligor to Vornado under the Vornado Reimbursement Agreement for the
reimbursement of payments under the Guaranties).

            (hh) Borrower will not form, hold, or acquire any subsidiary or own
any other equity interest in any other Person except as expressly permitted in
the Loan Documents.

            (ii) Borrower will file any required tax returns and will make any
required payments under applicable tax law .

            (jj) If Borrower is a single member limited liability company,
Borrower shall have at least two springing members, one of which, upon the
dissolution of such sole member or the withdrawal or the disassociation of the
sole member from Borrower, shall immediately become the sole member of Borrower,
and the other of which shall become the sole member of Borrower if the first
such springing member no longer is available to serve as such sole member.

            (kk) Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that it will comply with
or cause the compliance with (i) all the representations, warranties and
covenants in this Section 3.1.24, and (ii) all the organizational documents of
Borrower.

            3.1.25 TAX FILINGS. Borrower has filed (or has obtained effective
extensions for filing) all federal, state and local tax returns (if any)
required to be filed and has paid or made adequate provision for the payment of
all federal, state and local taxes, charges and assessments (if any) payable by
Borrower. Borrower believes that its tax returns (if any) properly reflect the
income and taxes of Borrower for the periods covered thereby, subject only to
reasonable adjustments required by the Internal Revenue Service or other
applicable tax authority upon audit.

            3.1.26 SOLVENCY. Borrower (a) has not entered into the transaction
or any Loan Document with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any
creditor and (b) received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its
obligations under the Loan Documents. Giving effect to the Loan, the fair
saleable value of Borrower's assets exceeds and will, immediately following the
making of the Loan, exceed Borrower's total liabilities, including, without
limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities. The
fair saleable value of Borrower's assets is and will, immediately following the
making of the Loan, be greater than Borrower's probable liabilities, including
the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities on its debts as such debts
become absolute and matured. Borrower's assets do not and, immediately following
the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry
out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not
intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur Indebtedness and liabilities
(including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to
pay such Indebtedness and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the
timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be
payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower).

            3.1.27 FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS. No part of the proceeds of the
Loan will be used for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring any "margin stock"
within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System or for any other purpose


                                      -75-
<PAGE>
which would be inconsistent with such Regulation U or any other Regulations of
such Board of Governors, or for any purposes prohibited by Legal Requirements or
by the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

            3.1.28 MEZZANINE DEBT. The Mezzanine Loan Documents constitute all
of the loan documents given to evidence or secure the Mezzanine Loan and
Borrower has delivered true and complete copies of the same to Agent. To the
best of Borrower's knowledge, there is no default under the Mezzanine Loan

that Agent shall have expressly approved such Lease (not to be unreasonably
withheld) regardless of whether such approval would otherwise have been required

Lease without Agent's prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless and

this Agreement or the right to assign without Borrower's consent under a
specific circumstance (such as mergers or consolidations) is included within the
approved Leasing Parameters.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 4.1.9:

      transaction, including, without limitation, identity of tenant, square

      (10) Business Days, and Borrower sends a second written request by Notice
      (specially marked in accordance with Section 10.6) and Agent fails to
      respond to such second request before the expiration of five (5) Business
      Days after Agent's receipt of such second request, then such proposed
      terms as set forth on such proposed term sheet shall be deemed to have
      been consented to or approved;

            (ii) whenever Agent's approval or consent is required pursuant to
      the provisions of this Section 4.1.9 for any matter that Lender has not
      previously approved a term sheet and tenant financials pursuant to Section
      4.1.9(c)(i) above, Agent shall use good faith efforts to respond within
      ten (10) Business Days after Agent's receipt of Borrower's written request
      for such approval or consent. If Agent fails to respond to such request
      within ten (10) Business Days, and Borrower sends a second written request
      by Notice (specially marked in accordance with Section 10.6) and Agent
      fails to respond to such second request before the expiration of five (5)
      Business Days after Agent's receipt of such second request, Agent shall be
      deemed to have approved or consented to the matter for which Agent's
      consent or approval was sought;

            (iii) whenever Agent's approval or consent is required pursuant to
      the provisions of this Section 4.1.9 for any matter that Agent has
      previously approved a term sheet pursuant to Section 4.1.9(c)(i) above,
      Agent shall use good faith efforts to respond within five (5) Business
      Days after Agent's receipt of Borrower's written request for such approval
      or consent together with the proposed Lease, provided that such request
      shall be accompanied by tenant financials unless previously furnished to
      Agent with the term sheet. If Agent fails to respond to such request
      within five (5) Business Days, and Borrower sends a second written request
      by Notice (specially marked as provided in Section 10.6), Agent shall be
      deemed to have approved or consented to the matter for which Lender's
      consent or approval was sought if Agent fails to respond to such second
      request before the expiration of such five (5) Business Day period,
      provided that there have been no material deviations from the term sheet
      and that the aggregate economics of the transaction are no less favorable
      to Borrower than as set forth in the term sheet;

            (iv) in the event that Agent shall have approved (or be deemed to
      have approved) a term sheet submitted by Borrower with respect to a
      certain Lease, Agent shall not withhold its approval or consent with
      respect to such Lease on the basis of any provisions of such Lease dealing
      with the items contained in the approved term sheet (it being understood
      that nothing in this clause (iv) limits Agent's obligation to approve
      Major Leases or renewals, amendments and modifications thereof under
      Section 4.1.9(b)); and

            (v) Borrower shall have the right, without the consent or approval
      of Lender in any instance, to terminate or accept a surrender of any Lease
      (except for a Required Lease) in the case of a bona fide breach or default
      by a Tenant of a material obligation


                                      -85-
<PAGE>
      under its Lease which breach has continued beyond the expiration of any
      applicable notice, grace or cure period or, with the approval of Agent
      (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) for any other bona fide sound
      business reason.

            (d) Borrower (i) shall observe and perform the obligations imposed
upon the lessor under the Leases in a commercially reasonable manner; (ii) shall
enforce the terms, covenants and conditions contained in the Leases upon the
part of the lessee thereunder to be observed or performed in a commercially
reasonable manner; provided, however, except as otherwise permitted pursuant to
Section 4.1.9(c)(v), Borrower shall not terminate or accept a surrender of any
Lease without Agent's prior approval (which approval in all cases other than a
Required Lease, shall not be unreasonably withheld); (iii) shall not collect any
of the Rents more than one (1) month in advance (other than security deposits
and the first month's rent upon signing); (iv) shall not execute any assignment
of lessor's interest in the Leases or the Rents (except as contemplated by the
Loan Documents); and (v) shall not alter, modify or change any Lease (unless as
changed such Lease would nevertheless satisfy the Leasing Parameters then in
effect hereunder and such Lease is not a Major Lease, is not a Lease as to which
Agent shall have entered into a Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment
Agreement or a Lease as to which Agent's approval was initially required) or
grant any option for additional space or term (unless the grant of any such
option if exercised would not constitute a Major Lease or require the approval
of Agent under this Section 4.1.9 had it been entered into as a direct lease
rather than an option), without in each case the prior approval of Agent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            (e) Upon request, Borrower shall furnish Agent with executed copies
of all Leases, certified as true and complete by Borrower.

            (f) Upon request, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
Borrower will cause any and all tenant security deposits, whether cash or cash
equivalents, to be maintained with or held by Agent. Agent shall hold such
deposits in an account that complies with applicable Legal Requirements.

            4.1.10 ALTERATIONS. Upon completion of the Improvements, Agent's
prior approval shall be required in connection with any alterations to any
Improvements that may (a) have a material adverse effect on Borrower's financial
condition, the value of the related Property or the Pro Forma NOI, (b) result in
a reduction of the square footage of the improvements and/or (c) adversely
affect the use or operation of the related Improvements, provided that Agent's
prior approval shall not be required in connection with any alterations to any
improvements in the Residential Component after any Condominium Conversion
occurs or to any tenant improvements pursuant to Leases which have been approved
(or deemed approved) by Agent or for which no approval was required in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If the total unpaid amounts
incurred and to be incurred with respect to any alterations to the Improvements
or after any Condominium Conversion to the Commercial Component shall at any
time exceed the Alteration Threshold, Borrower shall promptly deliver to Agent
as security for the payment of such amounts and as additional security for
Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents any of the following: (i) cash,
(ii) U.S. Obligations or (iii) other securities (including a Letter of Credit)
acceptable in all respects to Agent. Such security shall be in an amount equal
to the excess of the total unpaid amounts incurred and to be


                                      -86-
<PAGE>
incurred with respect to alterations to the Improvements (other than such
amounts to be paid or reimbursed by Tenants under the Leases) over the
Alteration Threshold. The provisions of this Section 4.1.10 shall not pertain
with respect to a Restoration for which the provisions of Article V are intended
to govern.

            4.1.11 FINANCIAL COVENANTS. During each Extension Period, the Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for the Property, calculated as of the first day of each
calendar quarter during each Extension Period (each such day, a "DETERMINATION
DATE"), shall not be less than 1.3 to 1.0 (the "MINIMUM DSCR"). If on any
Determination Date the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the Property shall be
less than the Minimum DSCR (a "TRIGGER EVENT"), Borrower shall deposit with
Agent all Net Cash Flow received by Borrower during the period (the "CASH TRAP
PERIOD") while the Trigger Event continues and until such time as such Trigger
Event has not existed for a period of six (6) consecutive months, and such Net
Cash Flow shall be held by Agent pursuant to Section 6.1 (the amounts deposited
with Agent pursuant to this Section 4.1.11 are referred to herein as the "NCF
FUNDS"). In the event that a Trigger Event shall continue for a period of three
(3) consecutive calendar quarters (including the calendar quarter in which the
Trigger Event occurs) (a "CONTINGENT AMORTIZATION TRIGGER EVENT"), the NCF Funds
being held by Agent and all NCF Funds thereafter received by Agent during the
Cash Trap Period shall be applied by Agent first to the payment of any accrued
and unpaid interest on the Loan and then to reduce the outstanding principal
balance of the Loan until and to the extent necessary to restore the Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for the Property to the required Minimum DSCR for a
period of six (6) consecutive months following the Contingent Amortization
Trigger Event. All such payments shall be applied to reduce the outstanding
principal balance of the Project Loan, the Supplemental Loan and/or the Building
Loan in such order and in such priority as Agent shall determine in its sole
discretion. The failure of the Property to maintain a Debt Service Coverage
Ratio on any Determination Date of at least the Minimum DSCR shall not
constitute a Default unless Borrower fails to thereafter deposit all Net Cash
Flow during the Cash Trap Period as required herein.

            4.1.12 UPDATED APPRAISAL. Upon the written request of Agent,
Borrower shall promptly reimburse Agent for the reasonable cost of an updated
appraisal of the Property as Agent may require, in form and substance and
conducted by an appraiser satisfactory to Agent and its internal appraisal staff
in all respects; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to
reimburse Agent for an updated FIRREA standard appraisal of the Property more
frequently than once every two (2) years.

            4.1.13 FACILITY FEE AND ADMINISTRATIVE FEE. Borrower shall pay to
Agent the Up-Front Fee and the Administrative Fee in accordance with the Loan
Fee Letter.

            4.1.14 INTEREST RATE PROTECTION AGREEMENT. (a) Not later than six
(6) months following the Closing Date, or within ten (10) Business Days after
request of Agent if prior to such time the 30-day LIBO Rate shall be greater
than 5.5%, Borrower shall obtain and at all times thereafter during the initial
term of the Loan, Borrower shall maintain in effect an Interest Rate Protection
Agreement having a term coterminous with the initial term of the Loan, with an
initial notional amount equal to the amount of the Loan or, if the Loan is not
then fully funded, having an increasing notional amount, with increases to be
based on the draw schedule for the Loan (with the intent that, to the extent
reasonably practicable, the notional amount applicable


                                      -87-
<PAGE>
from time to time shall equal the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and
that if it does not, Borrower shall, upon request by Agent, amend the Interest
Rate Protection Agreement to increase the notional amounts) and with a
Counterparty reasonably acceptable to Agent having a Minimum Counterparty
Rating. If Borrower obtains one (1) interest rate cap, the LIBOR strike rate
under the Interest Rate Protection Agreement shall be equal to or less than the
Capped LIBOR Rate calculated on an annual basis, or if Borrower obtains more
than one (1) interest rate cap, the blended LIBOR strike rate under the Interest
Rate Protection Agreement, as determined by Lender, shall be equal to or less
than the Capped LIBOR Rate. The Interest Rate Protection Agreement shall be in
form and substance substantially similar to the Interest Rate Protection
Agreement in effect as of the date hereof. In the event of any downgrade or
withdrawal of the rating of such Counterparty by any Rating Agency below a
credit rating from S&P and Fitch of at least "A" and from Moody's of at least
"A2", Borrower shall replace the Interest Rate Protection Agreement not later
than thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from Lender of such downgrade
or withdrawal with an Interest Rate Protection Agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Lender (and meeting the requirements set forth in
this Section 4.1.14) from a Counterparty reasonably acceptable to Lender having
a Minimum Counterparty Rating. Borrower shall have the right to pay the premium
for the Interest Rate Protection Agreement from the Interest Reserve.

            (b) Borrower shall comply with all of its obligations under the
terms and provisions of the Interest Rate Protection Agreement. Borrower shall
take all action reasonably requested by Agent to enforce Agent's rights under
the Interest Rate Protection Agreements in the event of a default by
Counterparty and shall not waive, amend or otherwise modify any of its rights
thereunder.

            (c) Borrower shall collaterally assign to Agent, pursuant to an
Assignment of Interest Rate Protection Agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT C-2, all of its right, title and interest to receive
any and all payments under the Interest Rate Protection Agreement (and any
related guarantee, if any) and shall deliver to Agent an executed counterpart of
such Interest Rate Protection Agreements, notify the Counterparty of such
collateral assignment and obtain the agreement (either in such Interest Rate
Protection Agreement or by separate instrument) of such Counterparty to make any
payments to become payable under or pursuant to the Agreement directly to Agent
until such time as the Assignment of Interest Rate Protection Agreement is
terminated or otherwise canceled. At such time as the Loan is repaid in full,
all of Agent's right, title and interest in the Interest Rate Protection
Agreement shall terminate and Agent shall execute and deliver at Borrower's sole
cost and expense, such documents as may be required to evidence Agent's release
of the Interest Rate Protection Agreements and to notify the Counterparty of
such release. If Agent receives any payments under the Interest Rate Protection
Agreement (other than a payment by reason of a termination event thereunder or
any other payment during the existence of an Event of Default), Agent shall have
the right to hold the same, deposit the same in a cash collateral account as
additional security for the Loan and to apply same to the payment of accrued and
unpaid interest on any Payment Date. If Agent receives any payments under the
Interest Rate Protection Agreement during the existence of an Event of Default
or by reason of a termination event under the Interest Rate Protection
Agreement, Agent shall have the right to hold same, to deposit same in such cash
collateral account or to apply same to any portion of the Debt in any order it
desires or, if the Interest Rate Protection Agreement has been partially or
wholly terminated, to apply same to the


                                      -88-
<PAGE>
cost of acquiring another interest rate protection agreement in form and
substance, and from a counterparty, satisfactory to Agent in all respects.

            (d) In the event that Borrower fails to purchase and deliver to
Agent the Interest Rate Protection Agreement as and when required hereunder,
Agent may purchase the Interest Rate Protection Agreements and the cost incurred
by Agent in purchasing the Interest Rate Protection Agreements shall be paid by
Borrower to Agent with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date such
cost was incurred by Agent until such cost is paid to Agent.

            (e) Borrower's failure to comply with any or all of the foregoing
covenants set forth in this Section 4.1.14 (within ten (10) Business Days after
notice thereof is given by Agent to Borrower) shall constitute an Event of
Default hereunder.

            4.1.15 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. Borrower shall (i) enforce
the Construction Management Agreement in the best interests of the Improvements
using sound business judgment, (ii) waive none of the material obligations of
any of the parties thereunder, (iii) do no act which would relieve Construction
Manager from its material obligations to construct the Improvements according to
the Plans and Specifications and (iv) make no amendments to or change orders
under the Construction Management Agreement, except as permitted under Section
4.2.13, without the prior approval of Agent which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Borrower shall from time to time, upon request by Agent,
use reasonable efforts to cause Construction Manager to provide Agent with
reports in regard to the status of construction of the Improvements, in such
form and detail as reasonably requested by Agent.

            4.1.16 ARCHITECT'S CONTRACT. Borrower shall (i) enforce the
Architect's Contract in the best interest of the Improvements using sound
business judgment, (ii) waive none of the material obligations of Borrower's
Architect thereunder, (iii) do no act which would relieve Borrower's Architect
from its material obligations under the Architect's Contract and (iv) make no
amendments to the Architect's Contract without the prior approval of Agent which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Borrower shall from time to time,
upon request by Agent, cause Borrower's Architect to provide Agent with reports
in regard to the status of construction of the Improvements, in such form and
detail as reasonably requested by Agent.

            4.1.17 INSURANCE. Borrower shall maintain in effect at all times
while Borrower is indebted to Lenders for the Loan the insurance policies
required by this Agreement. The proceeds of any insurance shall be applied in
accordance with the terms of Section 5.3. Borrower shall also furnish Agent with
evidence or certificates from insurance companies indicating that Borrower's
Architect and the Major Trade Contractors responsible for the design or
construction of the Improvements are covered by professional liability insurance
or other liability insurance, as applicable, as required by the applicable
contract approved by Agent; such evidence or certificates to be delivered to
Agent on or before the date of this Agreement.

            4.1.18 APPLICATION OF LOAN PROCEEDS. Borrower shall use the proceeds
of the Building Loan solely and exclusively for the purposes of constructing the
Improvements in accordance herewith and in accordance with the Building Loan
Budget that shall be subject to no change except as permitted hereby. Borrower
will receive the Advances to be made hereunder


                                      -89-
<PAGE>
and will hold the right to receive the same as a trust fund for the purpose of
paying the Costs of the Improvement and it will apply the same first to such
payment before using any part thereof for any other purpose.

            4.1.19 BUILDING LOAN COSTS AND EXPENSES. Borrower shall promptly pay
when due all Building Loan Costs unless Borrower is disputing in good faith
whether any such Building Loan Costs are due; provided that Borrower's right to
dispute the same shall not diminish Borrower's obligations to remove or
discharge in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents any mechanic's or materialman's Liens filed against the
Property.

            4.1.20 FEES. Borrower shall promptly pay when due the reasonable
fees of the Construction Consultant, all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, appraisal fees (to the extent provided
herein), recording fees and charges, abstract fees, title policy fees, escrow
fees, reasonable attorneys' fees, fees of inspecting architects and engineers to
the extent provided hereunder in connection with Advances, environmental
consultants to the extent provided in the Building Loan Mortgage, mortgage
servicing fees and expenses, and all other reasonable costs and expenses of
every character which have been incurred or which may hereafter be incurred by
Agent in connection with the preparation and execution of the Building Loan

funding of the Building Loan, and enforcement of the Building Loan Mortgage, the
Building Loan Note, and the other Building Loan Documents, and for any services

any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding; and Borrower will, within thirty (30)
days after demand by Agent (together with reasonable evidence of incurrence of
such expenses), reimburse Agent for all such reasonable expenses which have been
incurred. All amounts incurred or paid by Agent under this Section 4.1.20,
together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the due date until paid
by Borrower, shall be added to the Debt and shall be secured by the lien of the
Building Loan Mortgage.

            4.1.21 COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION. All work on the Improvements
shall be completed substantially in accordance with the Plans and Specifications
in a good and workmanlike manner and shall be free of any material defects.
Borrower shall diligently pursue construction of the Base Building Work to
completion and obtain a Zero Occupancy Certificate of Occupancy for all but the
retail space at the Property (except that Borrower shall not be required to
provide a Zero Occupancy Certificate of Occupancy for the Residential Units at
the Property if Borrower has instead provided to Agent a temporary certificate

Loan Documents, free from any liens, claims or assessments (actual or
contingent) asserted against the Property for any material, labor or other items
furnished in connection therewith; and to pay all sums and to perform such
duties as may be necessary to complete such construction of the Base Building
Work. Evidence of satisfactory compliance with the foregoing shall be furnished
by Borrower to Agent on or before the Initial Maturity Date. Borrower shall also
obtain final inspections and sign-offs of all components of the Base Building
Work for which inspections are required, to the extent that such inspections and
sign-offs can be obtained at that point in the construction process. In
addition, Borrower shall diligently pursue and achieve Completion of the
Improvements after the Initial Maturity Date.

            4.1.22 INSPECTION OF PROPERTY. Borrower shall permit Agent, the
Construction Consultant and their respective representatives, to enter upon the

            4.1.23 CONSTRUCTION CONSULTANT. Borrower acknowledges that (i) the
Construction Consultant has been retained by Agent to act as a consultant and
only as a consultant to Agent in connection with the construction of the
Improvements and has no duty to Borrower, (ii) the Construction Consultant shall
in no event have any power or authority to give any approval or consent or to do
any other act or thing which is binding upon Lenders, (iii) Agent reserves the
right to make any and all decisions required to be made by Agent under this
Agreement and to give or refrain from giving any and all consents or approvals

without being bound or limited in any manner or under any circumstance
whatsoever by any opinion expressed or not expressed, or advice given or not
given, or information, certificate or report provided or not provided, by the
Construction Consultant with respect thereto, (iv) Agent reserves the right in
its sole and absolute discretion to disregard or disagree, in whole or in part,
with any opinion expressed, advice given or information, certificate or report

<PAGE>
            (b) To review Draw Requests and change orders; and

            (c) To make periodic inspections (approximately at the date of each

defects in the Improvements or any departure in any material respect from the
Plans and Specifications not previously approved by Agent to the extent required
hereunder. Borrower agrees that the advance of any proceeds of the Building Loan

acquired hereby confidential unless already known to the general public or as

contemplated hereunder in connection with constructing and operating the
Improvements, the indebtedness created under the Supplemental Loan Documents and
Project Loan Documents and the Indebtedness permitted pursuant to Section
4.2.14, which other Indebtedness in each case is paid on a timely basis.


                                      -92-

Payment and Performance Bonds with respect to the obligations of each Major
Trade Contractor to the extent required hereunder. In the event that Borrower is
required to present the original counterparts of such Bonds in connection with
making a claim against the surety thereunder, then Agent shall return the Bonds
to Borrower to the extent necessary for such limited purpose, except that if a
material Default or an Event of Default exists Agent will present the Bonds, at
Borrower's request, however, any and all proceeds that would have been payable
to Borrower under the Bonds upon such presentment must be paid to Agent and such
proceeds shall be deemed to be Funds under Article VI.

            4.1.30 FINANCING PUBLICITY. Subject to the prior reasonable approval
of Borrower, Borrower shall permit Agent and Lenders to obtain publicity in
connection with the construction of the Improvements through press releases and
participation in such events as ground breaking and opening ceremonies, and to
give Agent and Lenders ample advance notice of such events and to give Agent and
Lenders such assistance as reasonably possible in connection with obtaining such

the execution thereof by Borrower all proposed easements, restrictions,
covenants, permits, licenses, and other instruments which would affect the title

part thereof to any easement, restriction or covenant (including any restriction
or exclusive use provision in any lease or other occupancy agreement) without
the prior approval of Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Agent

            4.1.32 LABORERS, SUBCONTRACTORS AND MATERIALMEN. Borrower shall
notify Agent immediately, and in writing, if Borrower receives any default
notice, notice of lien or demand for past due payment, written or oral, from any
laborer, subcontractor or materialmen. Borrower will also furnish to Agent at
any time and from time to time upon reasonable demand by Agent, lien waivers in
form reasonably satisfactory to Agent bearing a then current date from the Trade
Contractors covering work performed which was the basis of the immediately prior
Advance (subject, however, to Section 2.9.1(e)(xiv).

            4.1.33 OWNERSHIP OF PERSONALTY. Borrower shall furnish to Agent, if
Agent so requests, photocopies of the fully executed contracts, bills of sale,
receipted vouchers and agreements, or any of them, under which Borrower claims
title to the materials, articles, fixtures and other personal property used or
to be used in the construction or operation of the Improvements.

            4.1.34 COMPLY WITH OTHER BUILDING LOAN DOCUMENTS. Borrower shall
perform all of Borrower's obligations under the Building Loan Note and the other
Building Loan Documents.

            4.1.35 PURCHASE OF MATERIAL UNDER CONDITIONAL SALE CONTRACT.
Borrower shall not permit any materials, equipment, fixtures or any other part
of the Improvements to be purchased or installed under any security agreement or
other arrangements wherein the seller reserves or purports to reserve the right
to remove or to repossess any such items or to consider them personal property
after their incorporation in the Improvements, unless authorized by Agent in
writing and in advance or otherwise permitted in accordance with Section 4.2.14.

            4.1.36 FURTHER ASSURANCE OF TITLE. Borrower shall further assure
title as follows: If at any time Agent has reason to believe in its reasonable
opinion that any Advance is not secured or will or may not be secured by the
Building Loan Mortgage as a first priority lien or security interest on the
Improvements (subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances), then Borrower shall,
within ten (10) days after written notice from Agent, do all things and matters
necessary (including execution and delivery to Agent of all further documents
and performance of all other acts which Agent reasonably deems necessary or
appropriate) to assure to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent that any Advance
previously made hereunder or to be made hereunder is secured or will be secured
by the Building Loan Mortgage as a first priority lien or security interest with
respect to the Improvements (subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances).
Lenders, at Agent's option, may decline to make further Advances hereunder until
Agent has received such assurance. The Title Company, in its capacity as
subrogee to Lenders' rights against Borrower, shall not have the right to
enforce this Section 4.1.36 against Borrower.

            4.1.37 CONDOMINIUM. The provisions of this Section 4.1.37 shall
apply in the event that Borrower elects to convert the Property to a condominium
form of ownership:

            (a) Borrower shall submit to Agent an offering plan, which offering
plan and all documents contained therein have been reasonably approved by Agent
(the "OFFERING PLAN"), for the establishment of condominium ownership of the
Property, prior to Borrower's submitting said Offering Plan to the New York
State Department of Law for review and acceptance for filing. To the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, Borrower shall include in the


                                      -94-
<PAGE>
Offering Plan and/or other appropriate Condominium Documents a provision that
for the purpose of Section 339-cc of the New York Real Property Law, the
specified percentage of unit owners means such percentage in common interest in
the aggregate and not such percentage in number of units in the aggregate.
Borrower shall, subject to Agent's prior approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), promptly submit all amendments and supplements to such
plan required by Legal Requirements to the New York State Department of Law.
Borrower promptly shall obtain acceptance for filing of the Offering Plan, as so
amended or supplemented, by the New York State Department of Law. If Agent
disapproves an amendment, it shall furnish Borrower with a written statement
setting forth the reasons for disapproval. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Agent's consent shall not be required for price change amendments that increase
prices or for immaterial or ministerial amendments that are otherwise required
by the Department of Law or amendments required to conform to changes in the
Condominium Act (including any regulations promulgated thereunder).

            (b) The form of Qualifying Contract contained in the Offering Plan
shall be subject to Agent's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. If permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, each Qualifying
Contract shall provide that it may be terminated by Borrower in the event that a
material Casualty (including any Casualty that affects 25% or more of the
Building) shall occur prior to the closing of title thereunder.

            (c) Borrower shall cause the Condominium Documents to comply with
all applicable Legal Requirements.

            (d) Borrower shall comply with all Legal Requirements in connection
with the offering and sale of Residential Units.

            (e) Borrower shall hold or shall cause to be held any deposits in
connection with any Qualifying Contract in an account maintained with the escrow
agent set forth in the Offering Plan, or another escrow agent reasonably
acceptable to Agent, and shall not withdraw such deposits for any purpose except
as expressly provided in the applicable Qualifying Contract, or in accordance
with Legal Requirements or the Condominium Documents. Borrower shall assign its
rights therein to Agent pursuant to the Conditional Assignment of Condominium
Documents. If permitted under applicable law, Borrower shall designate Agent as
the depository bank with respect to escrow agent's holding of such deposits,
provided that Agent pays a market rate of interest on such deposits. Without
limiting the foregoing, Borrower shall not permit the proceeds of any such
deposits to be used to pay for construction or other costs related to the
Improvements, except to the extent that such deposit was expressly agreed to be
used for additional custom work under the applicable Qualifying Contract subject
to compliance with Legal Requirements.

            (f) If the purchaser under any Qualifying Contract shall default in
performance of its obligations thereunder beyond all applicable grace, notice
and cure periods and Borrower shall retain the deposit thereunder as liquidated
damages, Borrower shall give prompt notice to Agent of such retention and shall
prepay the Loan in an amount equal to such deposit (net of collection and
brokerage expenses, if any); provided that until such time as Borrower shall
have retained the first $140,000,000 of Required Release Prices in accordance
with Section 4.1.37(j)(i)(H), Borrower shall have the right to retain such
deposits to be applied against


                                      -95-
<PAGE>
Borrower's right to retain the first $140,000,000 of Required Release Prices as
hereinafter provided. Borrower shall be required to retain any such deposit in
respect of any Qualifying Contract that was necessary in order to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 2.1.5(b)(ix) or Section 2.1.5(c)(iv).

            (g) Without the prior written consent of Agent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), Borrower shall not:

            (i) prior to a Condominium Conversion, amend, modify, supplement or
      terminate any of the Condominium Documents, other than an amendment,
      modification or supplement which merely increases the price of any
      Residential Unit or that is otherwise required by the Department of Law or
      amendments required to conform to changes in the Condominium Act
      (including any regulations promulgated thereunder), but, in any case,
      Agent shall be given notice of any such amendment, modification or
      supplement and shall not vote its shares to do any of the foregoing after
      a Condominium Conversion without such consent and notice;

            (ii) sell or offer for sale any Residential Units except in
      compliance with the Condominium Documents and all applicable Legal
      Requirements;

            (iii) enter into any contract for the sale of any Residential Unit
      unless (A) the same is a bona fide, unconditional (subject to clause (G)
      of this paragraph) contract in the form included in the Offering Plan with
      such changes to such form as may be negotiated by Borrower in good faith
      and on an arm's length basis, provided that such changes shall not
      contravene any of the requirements provided for in this Agreement for such
      contract to qualify as a Qualifying Contract or otherwise materially
      adversely affect Agent or Lenders, (B) the purchaser thereunder is not an
      affiliate of Borrower except as otherwise permitted under Section
      4.1.37(g)(vi), (C) the sale price is greater than or equal to the Minimum
      Release Price, (D) the sale price is payable in full by bank or certified
      check or wire transfer of immediately available funds at closing, (E) the
      Offering Plan has been accepted for filing with the New York State
      Department of Law, (F) the purchaser under be required to deposit with the
      escrow agent under the Offering Plan a cash amount equal to not less than
      ten percent (10%) of the purchase price (or a letter of credit in such
      amount) and such contract shall provide that such amount shall be retained
      by Borrower as liquidated damages upon default beyond all applicable
      grace, notice and cure periods by the purchaser of its purchase obligation
      under such contract and (G) such contract shall be subject to no
      conditions (other than financing contingencies and completion of
      construction) upon the purchaser's obligation (except for customary title
      conditions and Legal Requirements, including rights of rescission required
      by law);

            (iv) (A) amend, modify or supplement any Qualifying Contract in any
      material manner or in any manner which would materially adversely affect
      Borrower, Agent, Lenders or the Property, or terminate any Qualifying
      Contract (except for default on the part of a purchaser thereto but with
      prompt notice to Agent), or permit any of the foregoing actions to be
      taken or (B) release any deposit under any Qualifying Contract, except in
      each case, in accordance with the terms of such Qualifying Contract and
      this Agreement or as otherwise required by Legal Requirements or the
      Department of Law or


                                      -96-
<PAGE>
      amendments required to conform to changes in the Condominium Act
      (including any regulations promulgated thereunder);

            (v) declare the Offering Plan effective before Borrower has entered
      into Qualifying Contracts for at least 25% percent of the Residential
      Units (which, for purposes hereof, shall not include contracts of sale
      with Vornado or any other Affiliate of Borrower unless Agent shall have
      consented thereto) or abandon or materially change its plan for submission
      of the Property to the condominium form of ownership except that to the
      extent permitted by Legal Requirements, if requested to by Agent, Borrower
      shall terminate, rescind and take such steps as shall be necessary to
      unwind the Condominium Conversion with respect to the Property if prior to
      the sale of the first Residential Unit, a Casualty occurs, the Bloomberg
      Lease terminates by reason of such Casualty and pursuant to the
      Condominium Act the Building is nevertheless required to be restored; or

            (vi) enter into any contract for sale of any Residential Units to
      Vornado or any other Affiliate of Borrower unless (A) such contract would
      otherwise qualify as a Qualifying Contract, and (B) such contracts are on
      market arms-length terms; except that (I) for the purposes of Sections
      2.1.5(b) and (c) not more than 10% of the Qualifying Contracts or Required

      Affiliate of Borrower or Vornado and (II) the requirements of clause (B)
      shall not apply with respect to up to 10% of the Residential Units
      provided the Minimum Release Price for any such affiliated contract that
      is not on market arms-length terms shall equal $800 per square foot of
      space in the applicable Residential Unit.

            (h) Agent shall, on Borrower's written request, contemporaneously
with Agent's release of the first Residential Unit from the liens of the
Mortgage, subordinate the lien of the Building Loan Mortgage, Supplemental Loan
Mortgage and the Project Loan Mortgage to the declaration of condominium for the
Land and Improvements and shall execute the appropriate instruments (reasonably
satisfactory in all respects to Agent) in recordable form to effect such
subordination, upon the satisfaction of the conditions enumerated below (so that
after giving effect to the filing of such subordination, the Mortgage
constitutes a lien only on the applicable Residential Units and the
corresponding interests in the common elements). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Agent shall subordinate the liens of the Mortgage to such declaration of
condominium at such earlier time, if any, that Borrower is required to file the
declaration of condominium pursuant to the Bloomberg Lease, provided that each
of the "Commencement Dates" under (and as defined in) the Bloomberg Lease shall
already have occurred and provided further that Borrower agrees that until the
sale of the first Residential Unit, Agent's and Lenders' rights under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, under Article V of this Agreement
shall not be impaired by such earlier filing.

            (i) Agent shall have received and approved (not to be unreasonably
      withheld) in all respects the Condominium Documents (to the extent not
      previously approved in writing by Agent) which shall be in proper form for
      recording or filing, as necessary, in the appropriate offices;

            (ii) the title policy or policies insuring the Building Loan
      Mortgage, Supplemental Loan Mortgage and the Project Loan Mortgage shall
      have been endorsed to


                                      -97-
<PAGE>
      provide affirmative insurance, to the effect that the Property constitutes
      a condominium validly created under the Condominium Act and Agent shall
      have received such endorsement' from the Title Company;

            (iii) Borrower shall have duly executed and delivered, or caused to
      be duly executed and delivered, to Agent (a) a conditional assignment of
      Borrower's or the declarant's (if the declarant under the applicable
      Condominium Documents is other than Borrower) rights under the Condominium
      Documents ("CONDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT OF CONDOMINIUM DOCUMENTS") in the form
      of SCHEDULE XXIV, (b) conditional resignations of the officers and members
      of the board of directors of the applicable condominium association who
      have been appointed or elected by Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower in
      the form of SCHEDULE XXV and (c) a letter from the person (if other than
      Agent) who, pursuant to the Offering Plan, shall hold the deposits in
      escrow under any contract of sale of any Residential Units in the form of
      SCHEDULE XXVI;

            (iv) Agent shall have received an opinion (upon which Agent and
      Lenders and their respective successors and assigns may rely) from counsel
      reasonably satisfactory to Agent to the effect that (A) the Condominium
      Documents satisfy all applicable requirements of Governmental Authorities
      and have been duly executed, (B) all requirements of any applicable
      statute, rule or ordinance relating to the formation of the condominium
      have been duly satisfied and, assuming the recording of the declaration of
      condominium and the subordination of the Building Loan Mortgage,
      Supplemental Loan Mortgage and Project Loan Mortgage to the declaration of
      condominium, the condominium has been duly and validly created and is
      existing in full force and effect and no filing, registration or other
      compliance with any federal or state securities law or other Legal
      Requirement will be required in connection with the sale of Residential
      Units in New York State, or if such filing is necessary, that the
      applicable Legal Requirement governing the same has been fully complied
      with and (C) the assignment, resignations and agreements referred to in
      clause (iii) of this subsection have each been duly authorized, executed
      and delivered by the respective parties thereto and are enforceable
      against said parties in accordance with their respective terms (the form
      of opinion attached hereto as SCHEDULE XXIX is acceptable to Agent);

            (v) the Offering Plan for the condominium (A) has been accepted by
      all Governmental Authorities whose acceptance is required under any Legal
      Requirements, and (B) has become effective; and

            (vi) the condominium association which shall be created by the
      Condominium Documents shall have furnished to Agent, at no cost or expense
      to Agent, a blanket fire insurance policy with extended coverage naming
      Agent, said condominium association, and purchasers of each Residential
      Unit, as their respective interests may appear, as the insureds, covering
      all of the Improvements for the full replacement value (other than
      foundations); said fire insurance shall at all times be an amount equal to
      100% of the insurable value of the Improvements (other than foundations)
      and shall otherwise comply with the applicable conditions contained in
      Article V of this Agreement and the other Building Loan Documents.

            (j) (i) Provided that no Event of Default exists under this
Agreement, Agent shall release one or more Residential Units from the lien of
the Building Loan Mortgage, Supplemental Loan Mortgage and Project Loan Mortgage
and all other Loan Documents securing the indebtedness evidenced by the Building
Loan Note, the Supplemental Loan Note and the Project Loan Note (and from any
UCC-1 financing statements executed by Borrower in favor of Agent covering such
Units) and deliver to Borrower a duly executed release(s) in recordable form, a
UCC-3 release of security interest and other such documents as may be reasonably
required to release the Residential Unit(s) from the lien and/or security

                        (B) Borrower shall have entered into Qualifying

                  have expired) for the sale of not less than 20% of the net
                  square footage of all Residential Units (as such square
                  footage is described in the Offering Plan);

                        (C) Agent shall have received a copy of an executed
                  Qualifying Contract with reference to such Unit;

                        (D) Agent shall have received not less than five (5)
                  Business Days prior written notice of the proposed release
                  accompanied by a pro forma settlement statement signed by
                  Borrower and reflecting the Net Sales Proceeds from the sale
                  of such Unit and the Required Release Price;

                        (E) contemporaneously with such release there shall be a
                  sale of such Unit pursuant to an approved form of Qualifying

                  obligated to fund (assuming that Borrower satisfies the
                  conditions precedent thereto), equals or exceeds 13%, Borrower
                  shall be entitled to receive and retain the Required Release
                  Prices until Borrower shall have received an aggregate amount
                  equal to $140,000,000 less the aggregate amount of any and all

      Borrower. Borrower shall have the option, from and after the Condominium

            (c) On or before the Closing Date, Residential Owner shall deliver

interests in such Certificates and agrees to hold the same in accordance with

or any of the 421-a Tax Benefits within five (5) Business Days after Borrower
obtains knowledge thereof. Borrower's notice to Agent shall include a statement
setting forth details of the occurrence referred to therein and stating what
action Borrower proposes to take with respect thereto. Borrower shall deliver to
Agent any material notices received or sent by Borrower or the City of New York
or any other party with respect to any 421-a Negotiable Certificate or any of
the 421-a Tax Benefits within five (5) Business Days after Borrower receives or

faith reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain Additional Development Rights in
order to include the Bonus Area within the Improvements. Without limiting the
foregoing, Borrower shall use good faith reasonable efforts to obtain the

shall require possession of the Certificates in order to effectuate the purposes
for which the same are intended, Agent shall redeliver the Certificates to
Borrower's counsel pursuant to escrow instructions reasonably satisfactory to
Agent in which (subject also to Section 4.1.39(b)) such escrow holder recognizes

accordance with said instructions for the benefit of Agent and Lenders.

            (e) Upon reasonable request from time to time, Borrower shall
deliver to Agent a progress report with regard to the construction of the lower
income housing development by the Off-Site Developer on the Off-Site Property
pursuant to the Inclusionary Air Rights Agreement.

plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, subject to Title I of ERISA, (b)
none of the assets of Borrower will constitute "plan assets" of one or more such
plans within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, (c) Borrower will not

                  4.1.43 REA. Borrower shall, at Agent's request, provided that
the Condominium Conversion shall not have already occurred, execute, deliver and
record a Declaration of Rights and Reciprocal Easements (as the same may be
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in
accordance with the terms hereof, the "REA"), in form and substance satisfactory
to Agent, within thirty (30) days after an Event of Default shall have occurred
relating to a monetary Default or any other material Default including, without
limitation, failure of Borrower to proceed with the construction of the
Improvements in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The REA shall
provide for, inter alia, (i) cross easements between the two parcels comprising
the Property, (ii) allocation of responsibilities for construction, maintenance,
support and operations, including, without limitation, utilities, for such
parcels and the improvements to be located thereon, as between such parcels and
the respective owner of each such parcel, (iii) the respective rights and
obligations of the owners of such parcels to build and restore the Improvements,
(iv) the respective rights and obligations of the owners of such parcels in the
event of a Casualty or Condemnation, including, without limitation, the
obligations to restore and the rights to any Net Proceeds or Award, and (v) the
rights and remedies of an owner to perform the obligations of the other owner if
the other owner fails to do so, including the rights to lien the other owner's
property. In the event that the REA shall not have been duly executed and
delivered and properly recorded in the City Register's Office, New York County,
prior to the commencement of a foreclosure proceeding against the Property or
prior to the filing of any bankruptcy proceeding (voluntary or involuntary)
against either Commercial Owner or Residential Owner, Borrower agrees that it
will not adopt a foreclosure or bankruptcy strategy or interpose defenses
(including, without limitation, any defenses that the assets of Borrower must be
marshaled) which would oppose or contravene or otherwise interfere with the
foreclosure of both parcels comprising the Property simultaneously in a single
sale as though both such parcels were but a single parcel owned by one owner.
Borrower acknowledges in connection with the foregoing that Agent and Lenders
(A) have entered into this Agreement and the other Loan Agreements and Lenders
have agreed to make the Loan in reliance on their ability to treat the Property
for collateral purposes as though it were a single parcel, (B) would not have
made a loan against either parcel independently of the other and (C) are
permitting the continued subdivision of the Property as two parcels with
separate ownership in each Borrower merely to accommodate Borrower's tax and
organizational needs. In furtherance of the foregoing, and in consideration for
Lenders agreeing to make the Loan, each Borrower agrees to include a provision
in its Organizational Documents that if either Borrower is involved in a
bankruptcy proceeding (voluntary or involuntary), at the request of Agent, the
other Borrower will file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and support Agent in
seeking on behalf of Lenders or will itself seek on its own behalf procedural
consolidation of both proceedings, and such provision may not be amended or
modified without the consent of Agent (and will expressly so provide).

                  SECTION 4.2 BORROWER NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

                  Borrower covenants and agrees that:

                  4.2.1 DUE ON SALE AND ENCUMBRANCE; TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS.

                  4.2.2 LIENS. Borrower shall not create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any Lien on any portion of the Property except for Permitted

Documents) or on any Qualifying Contract (except for the Liens of the Loan
Documents) or on any Qualifying Contract (except for the Liens of the Loan
Documents).

                  4.2.3 DISSOLUTION. Borrower shall not engage in any
dissolution, liquidation or consolidation or merger with or into any other
business entity, or transfer, lease or sell, in one transaction or any
combination of transactions, all or substantially all of the property or assets
of Borrower except in each case to the extent expressly permitted by the
Building Loan Documents.

                  4.2.4 CHANGE IN BUSINESS. Borrower shall not enter into any

otherwise forgive or release any claim or debt (other than termination of Leases
in accordance herewith) owed to Borrower by any Person, except for adequate
consideration and in the ordinary course of Borrower's business; provided,
however, that prior to delivery of the First Extension Notice, if the purchaser
under any Qualifying Contract shall default in performance of its obligations
thereunder beyond all applicable grace, notice and cure periods, Borrower may
release the purchaser from any obligations thereunder and return the contract
deposit to such purchaser without the prior reasonable approval of Agent and
such contract shall not be included as a Qualifying Contract for any purposes
hereunder. Thereafter, during any Extension Period if the purchaser under any
Qualifying Contract shall default in the performance of its obligations
thereunder beyond any applicable grace, notice and cure periods, Borrower may
release the purchaser from any obligations thereunder and return the contract
deposit to such purchaser without the prior approval of Agent unless such
Qualifying Contract was included in the determination (and still is necessary to
be included in such determination) of whether Borrower qualified for an
extension of the term of the Loan pursuant to Section 2.1.5, in which case,
Borrower may release the purchaser under such Qualifying Contract from any
obligations thereunder and return the contract deposit to such purchaser without
the prior reasonable approval of Agent only if Borrower shall have entered into
a new Qualifying Contract for the Residential Unit in question.

                  4.2.6 AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS. Borrower shall not enter into,
or be a party to, any transaction with an Affiliate of Borrower or any of the
constituent members of Borrower except in the ordinary course of business and on
terms which are fully disclosed to Agent in advance and are no less favorable to
Borrower or such Affiliate than would be obtained in a comparable arm's-length
transaction with an unrelated third party. Agent acknowledges that the Affiliate
Contracts listed on SCHEDULE XXII satisfy the foregoing requirements of this
Section 4.2.6. Borrower shall not amend or permit the amendment of any Affiliate
Contracts without the prior consent of Agent except on terms which are fully
disclosed to Agent in advance and that are no less favorable to Borrower or such
Affiliate than would be obtained in a comparable arm's-length transaction with
an unrelated third party.

                  4.2.7 ZONING. Borrower shall not initiate or consent to any
zoning reclassification of any portion of the Property or seek any variance
under any existing zoning

that could result in such use becoming a non-conforming use under any zoning
ordinance or any other applicable land use law, rule or regulation, without the
prior consent of Agent. Borrower will promptly notify Agent of any anticipated
or proposed change in the zoning for the Property or any portion thereof or any
other property with respect to which a change in zoning would affect the zoning
or Borrower's use and enjoyment of the Property, or any part thereof, promptly
upon its learning of any such anticipated or proposed change. Agent shall have
the right to participate (at Borrower's reasonable cost and expense) in any and
all proceedings, judicial, administrative or otherwise, with respect to or in
any way affecting the Property, including, without limitation, zoning,
environmental and other matters using counsel of Agent's choosing.

or initiate the joint assessment of the Property (i) with any other real
property constituting a tax lot separate from the Property, and (ii) with any
portion of the Property which may be deemed to constitute personal property, or
any other procedure whereby the lien of any taxes which may be levied against
such personal property shall be assessed or levied or charged to the Property.

                  4.2.10 PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS. Borrower shall not change
its chief executive office or chief place of business or its jurisdiction of
organization as set forth on SCHEDULE XIX without first giving Agent thirty (30)
days' prior notice.

<PAGE>
by or related to any of its shareholders, partners or members provided no Event
of Default has occurred and is then continuing and, provided, however, that no
such distribution or disbursement may be made during any Cash Trap Period other
than of distributable cash already on hand at the commencement of such period
that accrued prior to such period and other than of the Required Release Prices
that Borrower is entitled to retain pursuant to Section 4.1.37(f) and (j).
Borrower will use any and all Rents collected from the Property to pay operating

         performance of any party thereto other than Borrower other than in an
         immaterial respect that will not impact upon the Construction Schedule
         or (3) in any other way that could adversely affect Agent and the
         Lenders in any material respect; or

                  (iii) direct or permit the performance of any work pursuant to
         any revision (of whatever nature or form) of the Plans and

         instrument or understanding relating to the construction of the
         Improvements unless:

                  (A) such change order will not materially change the gross
         square feet or the net rentable square feet of commercial space to be
         contained in the Improvements or the net square feet of residential
         space to be contained in the Improvements, or the basic layout of the
         Improvements, or involve the use of materials, furniture, fixtures and
         equipment that will not be at least equal in quality to the materials,
         furniture, fixtures and equipment originally specified in or required
         by the approved Plans and Specifications; and

                  (B) such change order (excluding any change order that
         Bloomberg has the right to request under the Bloomberg Lease provided
         that Bloomberg is required to pay for the same and excluding any change
         order to the extent of the incremental cost (if any) that Borrower has
         deposited with Agent as hereinafter provided) shall, in a single
         instance, result in an increase or decrease in the cost of the
         Improvements of less than $5,000,000; however, if the aggregate cost of
         all such change orders (not previously approved by Agent and
         Construction Consultant or not required in order to comply with the
         Bloomberg Lease and required to be paid for by Bloomberg or for which
         Borrower has deposited such incremental cost as hereinafter provided to
         the extent of such incremental cost) at any given time, result in an
         increase or decrease in the cost of the


                                     -106-
<PAGE>
         Improvements of more than $10,000,000 then any and all subsequent
         change orders (excluding any change order that Bloomberg has the right
         to request under the Bloomberg Lease provided that Bloomberg is
         required to pay for the same and any such change order for which
         Borrower has deposited such incremental cost as hereinafter provided to
         the extent of such incremental cost), regardless of amount, must be
         previously approved by Agent and Construction Consultant as provided in
         this Section 4.2.13 unless Borrower deposits with Agent the incremental
         cost of such change order to the extent the same exceeds $10,000,000.
         Any amounts deposited by Borrower hereunder in connection with a change
         order shall be held by Agent in accordance with Section 2.1.11 and
         shall be disbursed by Agent to pay for such incremental costs subject
         to the conditions for disbursing or applying sums under such Section
         2.1.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be permitted
         to make any change orders without the consent of the surety under any
         applicable Bonds to the extent that doing so would impair the sureties
         obligations thereunder.

                  (b) Borrower shall submit to Agent and Construction Consultant
copies of all change orders entered into with respect to the Improvements within
fifteen (15) days after the same are entered into, irrespective of whether the
same require the prior approval of Agent and Construction Consultant pursuant to
this Agreement. Agent shall use good faith efforts to respond within seven (7)
Business Days after Agent's receipt of Borrower's written request for such
approval. If Agent fails to respond to such request within seven (7) Business
Days, and Borrower sends a second written request by Notice (specially marked in
accordance with Section 10.6) together with a copy of such proposed change
order, and Agent fails to respond to such second request before the expiration
of three (3) Business Days after Agent's receipt of such second request, then
such proposed change order shall be deemed consented to or approved on the terms
proposed.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto
acknowledge that on the Closing Date the Plans and Specifications which will
have been delivered and approved by Agent on behalf of Lenders are preliminary
in nature as they relate to the Residential Component and the inclusion of an
additional floor of residential space and the elimination of the mezzanine
retail floor (as depicted on certain architectural drawings dated June 17, 2002
prepared by Borrower's Architect and submitted to Agent) and the impact of such
anticipated changes on the shared mechanical and structural systems.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, Agent and Lenders shall have no obligation to fund any
Advance beyond the Initial Advance unless and until final Plans and
Specifications therefor have been submitted to and approved by Agent and the
Construction Consultant in accordance with the terms hereof. Agent agrees not to
unreasonably withhold its approval to such final Plans and Specifications,
provided that the same are consistent with the preliminary Plans and
Specifications (with such modifications as are reflected conceptually in the
aforesaid architectural drawings) and the scope of work set forth in the
guaranteed maximum price attachment to the Construction Management Agreement
approved by Agent and Construction Consultant. Borrower shall cause to be
delivered to Agent certificates from Borrower's Architect and any other Design
Professionals substantially in the form attached hereto as SCHEDULE XVI together
with an updated Construction Manager's Certificate substantially in the relevant
form attached hereto as SCHEDULE XIV.

obligation to pay the same in good faith) and (B) incurred in the ordinary
course of business, (iv) lease takeover obligations provided that the same have
been entered into in accordance with Section 4.1.9, and (v) the "Borrower
Reimbursement Obligations" as defined in the Intercreditor and Subordination
Agreement provided that the same continues to be held by Mezzanine Lender or any
successor thereto that is permitted under Section 8.3 hereof. No Indebtedness
other than the Total Debt may be secured (subordinate or pari passu) by the
Property.

                  4.2.15 ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS. Borrower will not amend,
modify or otherwise change its Organizational Documents without the prior
consent of Agent in any manner that (i) violates the single purpose covenants
set forth in this Section 3.1.24, or (ii) amends, modifies or otherwise changes
any provision thereof that by its terms cannot be modified at any time when the
Loan is outstanding or by its terms cannot be modified without Agent or the
Lenders' consent or that violates the provisions of Section 4.1.43..

                           $55,000,000), provided that the requirement to
                           maintain the insurance under this clause (II) shall
                           be waived with respect to the Initial Advance but
                           must be maintained as a condition to Agent's and
                           Lenders' obligations to make any subsequent Advance;

                                    (III) Demolition and increased cost of
                           construction, including, without limitation,
                           increased costs arising out of changes in applicable
                           laws and codes;

                                    (IV) Operation of building laws (which
                           insurance under this clause (IV) may contain a
                           sublimit of $5,000,000); and

                                    (V) Terrorism or terrorist actions for a
                           minimum limit amount of $400,000,000 for so long as
                           the Existing Policy is in effect prior to renewal
                           and, thereafter, such amount not to exceed
                           $490,000,000, whether as part of the new or renewed
                           Builder's Risk policy or as covered by another
                           insurance policy, as can be obtained for an
                           additional premium of $2,700,000 subject to the
                           provisions of Section 5.1.3(b).

                           (B) Such insurance Policy shall name Agent as the
                  insured. Such Policy shall also name Agent under a
                  non-contributing New York standard mortgagee clause or an
                  equivalent endorsement satisfactory to the mortgagee for Real
                  Property and as "Loss Payee" as respects Rental Income
                  insurance. If the insurance required under this paragraph is
                  not obtained by blanket insurance Policies, the insurance
                  Policy shall be endorsed to also provide guaranteed building
                  replacement cost to the improvements and all tenant
                  improvements and betterments (except to the extent that the
                  Tenant is required to insure the same under the applicable
                  Lease) in an amount to be subject to the approval of Agent,
                  which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                           (C) Borrower shall cause the architect and the
                  engineer to obtain and maintain Architect's or Engineer's, as
                  the case may be, Professional Liability insurance during the
                  period commencing on the date of the Architect's Agreement or
                  the Engineer's Agreement, respectively, and expiring no
                  earlier than five (5) years after initial occupancy of the
                  Improvements. Such insurance shall be in an amount equal to at
                  least $3,000,000 per claim or as otherwise acceptable to
                  Agent. Coverage may be provided through the purchase of an
                  Owners Protective Professional Liability insurance Policy.

                           (D) Upon and at all times after energization of the
                  Building's electrical and /or mechanical systems,

                  $20,000,000 minimum limit for all mechanical and electrical
                  equipment against physical damage, rent loss and improvements
                  loss, with exclusions for testing removed. Such coverage shall
                  include, without limitation, all tenant improvements and
                  betterments (except to the extent that the Tenant is required
                  to insure the same pursuant to the applicable Lease).

                           (E) Commercial General Liability and Hired and Non
                  Owned Vehicle Liability insurance naming Agent as an
                  additional insured with a minimum liability of $100,000,000
                  including "Umbrella Liability," per occurrence and in the
                  aggregate per project.

                           (F) Workers Compensation and Disability insurance as
                  required by law covering Borrower.

                           (G) Borrower shall cause the Construction Manager
                  and/or General Contractors to obtain and maintain Commercial

                  products and completed operations and Automobile Liability
                  insurance with no less than $5,000,000 in limits per
                  occurrence or as otherwise acceptable to Agent and in the
                  aggregate per project through primary and umbrella liability
                  coverages. Such insurance shall name Borrower and Agent as
                  additional insureds. Borrower shall also require that all
                  Trade Contractors cause all of its respective subcontractors
                  to maintain similar coverage with limits of no less than
                  $3,000,000 per occurrence. All Persons engaged in work on the
                  improvements at the Property shall maintain statutory Workers
                  Compensation and Disability insurance in force for all workers
                  on the job.

                           (H) In lieu of providing the Commercial General and
                  Umbrella liability and Workers Compensation insurance required
                  in paragraphs (E), (F) and (G) above Borrower may provide such
                  insurance through the purchase of a Wrap-up or Owner
                  Controlled Insurance Program. This program shall provide
                  coverage for all Persons engaged in construction operations at
                  the Property (except to the extent that a particular Person is
                  excluded from coverage, but such Person provides evidence
                  reasonably acceptable to Agent prior to such Person's
                  commencement of work at the Property of such Person's own
                  coverage that meets the requirements set forth herein).

         (ii) At all times after substantial completion of the Improvements:

                           (A) Insurance against loss customarily included under
                  standard "All Risk" policies including flood, earthquake,
                  vandalism, and malicious mischief, boiler and machinery, and
                  such other insurable hazards as, under good insurance
                  practices, from time to time are insured against for other


                                     -110-
<PAGE>
                  property and buildings similar to the Property in nature, use,
                  location, height, and type of construction (it being agreed
                  that the aforesaid coverage for flood and earthquake may a
                  $100,000,000 sublimit). Such insurance Policy shall also
                  insure costs of demolition and increased cost of construction
                  (which insurance for demolition and increased cost of
                  construction may contain a sublimit of $5,000,000). The amount
                  of such insurance shall be not less than one hundred percent
                  (100%) of the replacement cost value of the improvements at
                  the Property. Each such insurance Policy shall contain an
                  agreed amount replacement cost endorsement and shall cover,
                  without limitation, all tenant improvements and betterments
                  (except to the extent that the Tenant is required to insure
                  the same pursuant to the applicable Lease) on a replacement
                  cost basis. If the insurance required under this paragraph is
                  not obtained by blanket insurance policies, the insurance
                  policy shall be endorsed to also provide guaranteed building
                  replacement cost to the improvements at the Property and such
                  tenant improvements and betterments in an amount to be subject
                  to the approval of Agent, which approval shall not be
                  unreasonably withheld. Agent shall be named Loss Payee on a
                  Standard Mortgagee Endorsement.

                           (B) Rent loss and/or business interruption insurance
                  in an amount not less than the amount of gross rents payable
                  in a 12 month period and which shall provide an Extended
                  Period of Indemnity Endorsement for 180 days on an actual loss
                  sustained basis, provided that Borrower shall maintain such
                  insurance in an amount not less than the amount of gross rents
                  payable in a 24 month period and which shall provide an
                  Extended Period of Indemnity Endorsement for 180 days on an
                  actual loss sustained basis if such additional 12 month period
                  of coverage is available at an additional annual premium not
                  to exceed $300,000. Agent shall be named as Loss Payee as
                  respects this coverage.

                           (C) Comprehensive Boiler and Machinery coverage, with
                  a $20,000,000 minimum limit for all mechanical and electrical
                  equipment against physical damage, rent loss and improvements
                  loss, with exclusions for testing removed. Such coverage shall
                  include, without limitation, all tenant improvements and
                  betterments (except to the extent that the Tenant is required
                  to insure the same pursuant to the applicable Lease) and
                  include, without limitation, coverage for rental interruption
                  insurance on an actual loss sustained basis with an Extended
                  Period of Indemnity Endorsement for 180 days.

         (iii) At all times during the term of the Loan:

                           (A) Public Liability insurance, including, without
                  limitation, Commercial General Liability insurance; Owned
                  Hired and Non-Owned Auto Liability; and Umbrella Liability
                  coverage for Personal Injury, Bodily Injury, Death, Accident
                  and Property Damage, providing in


                                     -111-
<PAGE>
                  combination no less than $50,000,000 per occurrence and in the
                  annual aggregate on per project basis, if aggregate limits are
                  shared with other locations the amount of Umbrella Liability
                  insurance to be provided shall be not less than $75,000,000.
                  The policies described in this paragraph shall cover, without
                  limitation: elevators, escalators, independent contractors,
                  Contractual Liability (covering, to the maximum extent
                  permitted by law, Borrower's obligation to indemnify Agent and
                  the Lenders as required under this Agreement), Products and
                  Completed Operations Liability coverage.

                           (B) Workers Compensation and Disability insurance as
                  required by applicable law.

                           (C) Such other types and amounts of insurance with
                  respect to the Property and the operation thereof that are
                  commonly maintained in the case of other properties and
                  buildings similar to the Property in nature, use, location,
                  height, and type of construction, as may from time to time be
                  reasonably required by Agent.

                  (iv) After the conversion of the Property to Condominium form
         of ownership, Borrower shall cause the Condominium Association to
         maintain the insurance provided for in this Section 5.1.1(a) until the
         Loan is repaid in full.

                  (b) All insurance provided for in Section 5.1.1(a) shall be
obtained under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "POLICIES" or
in the singular, the "POLICY"), and, to the extent not specified above, shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of Agent as to deductibles, loss payees and
insureds. Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration dates of the
Policies theretofore furnished to Agent, certificates of insurance evidencing
the Policies and within thirty (30) days after commencement of the new or
renewal Policy evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent of payment of the
premiums due thereunder (the "INSURANCE PREMIUMS"), shall be delivered by
Borrower to Agent in accordance with paragraph (g) below.

                  (c) Any required insurance may be procured under a blanket
insurance Policy covering the Property and other properties or assets of
Borrower or its affiliates, provided that any such blanket insurance Policy
shall specifically allocate to the Property the amount of coverage from time to
time required hereunder and shall otherwise provide the same protection as would
a separate Policy insuring only the Property in compliance with the provisions
of Section 5.1.1(a). Agent, in its reasonable discretion, shall determine
whether such blanket Policies provide sufficient limits of insurance.

                  (d) All Policies of insurance provided for or contemplated by
Section 5.1.1(a) shall name Borrower as the insured and Agent (for the ratable
benefit of Lenders and their successors and/or assigns) as the additional
insured, and in the case of property damage, builder's risk, boiler and
machinery, flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a so-called New York
standard non-contributing mortgagee clause or its equivalent in favor of Agent
(including Agent as mortgagee and loss payee) providing that the loss thereunder
shall be payable to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders and providing
thirty (30) days' advance


                                     -112-
<PAGE>
notice of cancellation to Agent. Loss of Rental Income insurance shall name
Agent (for the ratable benefit of Lenders and their successors and/or assigns)
as loss payee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower elects to convert the
Property to condominium form of ownership in accordance with Section 4.1.37,
from and after the Condominium Conversion, Agent's rights under this paragraph
(d) shall be subject to the terms of the declaration of condominium; however,
Borrower agrees to use reasonable efforts to designate Agent as the "Insurance
Trustee" under the Condominium Documents until the Loan is repaid in full.

                  (e) All Policies shall contain coverage for tenant
improvements and betterments that Borrower is required to insure pursuant to the
applicable Lease. All Property insurance also shall include a co-insurance
waiver and Agreed Amount Endorsement. The amount of any deductible under any
Policy must be reasonably acceptable to Agent. Without Agent's prior written
consent, Borrower shall not name any Person other than Agent, as loss payee, as
it pertains to the Property, nor shall Borrower carry separate or additional
insurance coverage covering the improvements at the Property concurrent in form
or contributing in the event of loss with that required by this Agreement or;
provided that, if blanket policies are obtained, this sentence shall not apply
to property covered by such blanket policies other than the improvements at the
Property and such tenant improvements and betterments that Borrower is required
to insure pursuant to the applicable Lease loan.

                  (f) Each Policy shall contain a provision whereby the insurer:
(i) agrees that such Policy shall not be canceled or terminated, the coverage,
deductible, and limits of such Policy shall not be modified, other provisions of
such Policy shall not be modified if such Policy, after giving effect to such
modification, would not satisfy the requirements of this Agreement, and such
Policy shall not be so modified, canceled or fail to be renewed, without in each
case, at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Agent, (ii) waives any
right to claim any Insurance Premiums and commissions against Agent, provided
that the Policy need not waive the requirement that the Insurance Premiums be
paid in order for a claim to be paid to the insured and (iii) provides that
Agent is permitted to make payments to effect the continuation of such policy
upon notice of cancellation due to non-payment of premiums. In the event any
Policy (except for general public and other liability and Workers Compensation
insurance) shall contain breach of warranty provisions, such Policy shall not be
invalidated by and shall insure Agent for the benefit of Lenders regardless of
(A) any act, failure to act or negligence of or violation of warranties,
declarations or conditions contained in such Policy by any named insured, (B)
the occupancy or use of the Property for purposes more hazardous than permitted
by the terms thereof, or (C) any foreclosure or other action or proceeding taken
by Agent pursuant to any provision of the Mortgage or any other Loan Document.

                  (g) Borrower shall pay the Insurance Premiums for the Policies
as the same become due and payable. Borrower shall deliver to Agent certified
copies of the Policies required to be maintained pursuant to Section 5.1.1(a);
provided, however, Agent and Lenders shall not be deemed by reason of the
custody of such Policies to have knowledge of the contents thereof. Borrower
also shall deliver to Agent within ten (10) days after Agent's request, a
statement setting forth the particulars as to all such Policies, indicating that
all Insurance Premiums due thereon have been paid and that the same are in full
force and effect. Not later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the expiration
date of each Policy, Borrower shall deliver to Agent a certificate of insurance
evidencing renewal of coverage as required herein. Not later


                                     -113-
<PAGE>
than thirty (30) days after the renewal or replacement of each of the Policies,
Borrower shall deliver to Agent evidence of payment of Insurance Premiums for
such renewal or replacement Policies reasonably satisfactory to Agent and not
later than sixty (60) days after the renewal or replacement of each of the
Policies, Borrower shall deliver to Agent an original or certified copy (as
required pursuant to this paragraph) of a renewal or replacement Policy or
Policies.

                  (h) If at any time Agent is not in receipt of written evidence
that all insurance required hereunder is maintained in full force and effect,
Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation), upon not less than five (5)
Business Days prior notice to Borrower, to take such action as Agent deems
necessary to protect Lenders' interest in the Property, including, without
limitation, the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Agent in its reasonable
discretion deems appropriate and all Insurance Premiums incurred by Agent in
connection with such action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in
effect shall be paid by Borrower to Agent upon demand and until paid shall be
secured by the Building Loan Mortgage and shall bear interest at the Default
Rate.

                  (i) In the event of foreclosure of the Building Loan Mortgage
and/or the Supplemental Project Loan Mortgage and/or the Project Loan Mortgage
or other transfer of title to the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part
of the Total Debt, all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the
Policies that are not blanket Policies then in force concerning the Property and
all proceeds payable thereunder (except, if the Condominium Conversion shall
have occurred, with respect to Policies maintained by the Condominium
Association, other than proceeds payable thereunder to Borrower as a Unit owner)
shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at such foreclosure or Agent or other
transferee in the event of such other transfer of title.

                  5.1.2 INSURANCE COMPANY. All Policies shall be issued by
financially sound and responsible insurance companies having a claims paying
ability rating of "A:X" or better by A.M. Best Company, Inc. or as otherwise
approved by Agent.

                  5.1.3 EXISTING POLICY. (a) Agent hereby confirms its approval
of the coverage provided under the existing comprehensive All Risk insurance
policy (the "EXISTING POLICY") maintained by Borrower with respect to the
Property, which expires on December 1, 2003 and which provides All Risk
coverage, including, without limitation, for "acts of terrorism" or other
similar acts or events, of $400,000,000 (the "EXISTING POLICY AMOUNT") with an
Agreed Amount Endorsement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the other Loan Agreements or any other Loan Document (including,
without limitation, the Guaranty of Completion), Agent's and Lenders'
obligations to make disbursements of the Loan proceeds pursuant to this
Agreement, the Supplemental Loan Agreement and/or the Project Loan Agreement
prior to December 1, 2003, shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the Existing
Policy Amount prior to December 1, 2003 (the "SPECIAL CAPPED LOAN AMOUNT").

                  (b) Following the expiration of the Existing Policy, Borrower
shall be required to maintain (or, if applicable, cause the Condominium
Association to maintain), at all times that the Loan remains outstanding, a
comprehensive All Risk insurance policy meeting the requirements set forth in
Section 5.1.1(a) above. Upon the renewal or replacement of the Existing Policy,
if "acts of terrorism" or other similar acts or events are hereafter excluded
from Borrower's comprehensive All Risk insurance policy, Borrower shall obtain
an endorsement to such Policy,


                                     -114-
<PAGE>
or a separate Policy from an insurance provider which maintains at least an
Investment Grade Rating from Moody's and/or S&P (provided that neither Moody's
or S&P rates such provider with less than an Investment Grade Rating), providing
insurance coverage for replacement cost and rental interruption against all such
excluded acts or events ("TERRORISM COVERAGE") on an agreed amount basis as is
available, (which amount shall not be required to exceed $490,000,000), and can
be purchased for an annual premium that does not exceed $2,700,000 (the "MAXIMUM
TERRORISM INSURANCE PREMIUM").

                  (i) If the Maximum Terrorism Insurance Premium purchases a
         minimum of $150,000,000 of Terrorism Coverage on an agreed amount
         basis, then Borrower shall pay to Agent, annually an additional fee
         which shall be calculated as the product of (A) the positive
         difference, if any, between (i) $340,000,000 and (ii) the actual amount
         of Terrorism Coverage, and (B) .5% per annum.

                  (ii) If the Maximum Terrorism Insurance Premium purchases less
         than $150,000,000 of Terrorism Coverage on an agreed amount basis, then
         Borrower shall advise Agent and Agent shall determine whether Borrower
         is required to purchase Terrorism Coverage in the amount that the
         Maximum Terrorism Insurance Premium would purchase on an agreed amount
         basis. In the event that Agent determines that Borrower is required to
         purchase Terrorism Coverage in such amount, then Borrower shall pay to
         Agent an annual fee in the amount of $950,000. In the event that Agent
         determines that Borrower is not required to purchase Terrorism Coverage
         in such amount, then Borrower shall pay to Agent an annual fee in the
         amount of $2,700,000.

The endorsement or policy shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Agent.

                  SECTION 5.2 CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION.

                  5.2.1 CASUALTY. If the Improvements shall sustain a Casualty,
Borrower shall give prompt notice of such Casualty to Agent and shall promptly
commence and diligently prosecute to completion the repair and restoration of
the Improvements as nearly as possible to the condition the Improvements was in
immediately prior to such Casualty (a "RESTORATION") and otherwise in accordance
with Section 5.3. Borrower shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or
not such costs are covered by insurance. Agent may, but shall not be obligated
to, make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower.

                  5.2.2 CONDEMNATION. Borrower shall give Agent prompt notice of
any actual or threatened Condemnation by any Governmental Authority of all or
any part of the Property and shall deliver to Agent a copy of any and all papers
served in connection with such proceedings. Agent may participate in any such
proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Agent all
instruments requested by Agent to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at
its expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Agent, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any Condemnation, Borrower
shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the manner provided for its
payment in the Building Loan Note and this Agreement, in the Supplemental Loan
Note and the Supplement Loan Agreement and in the Project Loan Note and the
Project Loan Agreement, respectively. Lenders shall not be limited to


                                     -115-
<PAGE>
the interest paid on the Award by any Governmental Authority but shall be
entitled to receive out of the Award interest and additional interest (if any)
at the rate or rates provided in this Agreement or in the Building Loan Note or
in the Supplemental Loan Agreement or in the Supplemental Loan Note or in the
Project Loan Agreement or in the Project Loan Note, as applicable. If the
Property or any portion thereof is taken by any Governmental Authority, Borrower
shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the
Improvements and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 5.3. If the
Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by
Agent of the Award, Agent shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency
judgment on the Building Loan Note, the Supplemental Note or the Project Loan
Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a
portion thereof sufficient to pay the Total Debt.

                  SECTION 5.3 DELIVERY OF NET PROCEEDS.

                  5.3.1 MINOR CASUALTY OR CONDEMNATION. If a Casualty or
Condemnation has occurred to the Improvements and the Net Proceeds shall be less
than the Restoration Threshold and the costs of completing the Restoration shall
be less than the Restoration Threshold, and provided no Event of Default shall
have occurred and remain uncured, the Net Proceeds will be disbursed by Agent to
Borrower. As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of the Net Proceeds
(but in no event later than sixty (60) days after such Casualty or Condemnation,
whichever the case may be, occurs) Borrower shall commence and satisfactorily
complete with due diligence the Restoration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower elects to convert the
Property to condominium form of ownership in accordance with Section 4.1.37,
from and after the Condominium Conversion, Agent's rights and obligations with
respect to this Section 5.3.1 shall be subject to the terms of the declaration
of condominium.

                  5.3.2 MAJOR CASUALTY OR CONDEMNATION. (a) If a Casualty or
Condemnation has occurred to the Improvements, Borrower shall commence and
satisfactorily complete with due diligence the Restoration in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, provided that Agent, if required to pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement shall have made the Net Proceeds available to Borrower
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If the Net Proceeds are
equal to or greater than the Restoration Threshold or the costs of completing
the Restoration is equal to or greater than the Restoration Threshold, Agent
shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration, provided that each of
the following conditions are met:

                  (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

                  (ii) in the event the Net Proceeds are an Award, less than ten
         percent (10%) of the land constituting the Property is taken, and such
         land is located along the perimeter or periphery of the Property, and
         no portion of the Improvements is the subject of the Condemnation;

                  (iii) the Bloomberg Lease shall remain in full force and
         effect during and after the completion of the Restoration
         notwithstanding the occurrence of such Casualty or Condemnation;


                                     -116-
<PAGE>
                  (iv) Agent shall be reasonably satisfied that (A) (I) if the
         Casualty or Condemnation occurs prior to the Completion of the
         Improvements, the undisbursed amount of the Net Proceeds and the
         undisbursed proceeds of the Loan and any Cash Collateral then being
         held by Agent pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement (after Borrower
         has elected to balance the Loan to the extent required in accordance
         with Section 2.1.11 hereof) shall be sufficient to pay for the
         remaining Building Loan Costs, Project Loan Costs and costs of the
         Restoration, as determined by Agent in its sole but reasonable
         judgment, or (II) if the Casualty or Condemnation occurs after the
         Completion of the Improvements, (1) the undisbursed amount of the Net
         Proceeds shall be sufficient to pay for the costs of completing the
         Restoration or Borrower has deposited sufficient funds with Agent to
         pay for any such deficiency or Borrower shall pay for such costs of
         completing the Restoration, as incurred, in the amount of such
         deficiency so that the undisbursed amount of the Net Proceeds shall be
         sufficient to pay for the costs of completing the Restoration and (2)
         any operating deficits and all payments of principal and interest under
         the Note will be paid during the period required for Restoration from
         (y) the Net Proceeds or (z) other funds of Borrower, and (B) (I) if the
         Casualty or Condemnation occurs before the Completion of the Base
         Building Work, Agent shall be satisfied that the Restoration will be
         completed and the Completion of the Base Building Work will be achieved
         on or before the Initial Maturity Date or such earlier date as may be
         required under the Bloomberg Lease, or (II) if the Casualty or
         Condemnation occurs during the First Extension Period, Agent shall be
         satisfied that the Restoration will be completed and Completion of the
         Improvements will be achieved on or before the First Extended Maturity
         Date or such earlier date as may be required for completion under the
         Bloomberg Lease; and

                  (v) the Property and the use thereof after the Restoration
         (and, if applicable, completion of the Improvements) will be in
         compliance with and permitted under all applicable Legal Requirements.

                  (b) The Net Proceeds shall be paid directly to Agent and held
by Agent in an interest-bearing account and, until disbursed in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 5.3.2, shall constitute additional security for
the Debt. The Net Proceeds shall be disbursed by Agent to, or as directed by,
Borrower from time to time during the course of the Restoration, promptly after
receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent that (i) all requirements
set forth in Section 5.3.2(a) have been satisfied, (ii) all materials installed
and work and labor performed (except to the extent that they are to be paid for
out of the requested disbursement) in connection with the Restoration have been
paid for in full, and (iii) there exist no notices of pendency, stop orders,
mechanic's or materialman's liens or notices of intention to file same, or any
other Liens of any nature whatsoever on the Property arising out of the
Restoration which have not either been fully bonded to the satisfaction of Agent
and discharged of record or, in the alternative, fully insured to the
satisfaction of Agent by the Title Company issuing the Title Insurance Policy.

                  (c) All plans and specifications required in connection with
the Restoration shall be subject to prior reasonable approval by Agent and by an
independent architect selected by Agent (which shall be the Construction
Consultant if the Casualty or Condemnation occurs prior to the Completion of the
Improvements) (the "CASUALTY CONSULTANT"). The identity of the


                                     -117-
<PAGE>
contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well
as the contracts under which they have been engaged, shall be subject to
reasonable approval by Agent and the Casualty Consultant. All costs and expenses
incurred by Agent in connection with recovering, holding and advancing the Net
Proceeds for the Restoration including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements and the Casualty Consultant's fees and
disbursements, shall be paid by Borrower.

                  (d) In no event shall Agent be obligated to make disbursements
of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually incurred
from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by
the Casualty Consultant, less the Casualty Retainage. The term "CASUALTY
RETAINAGE" shall mean, as to each contractor, subcontractor or materialman
engaged in the Restoration, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the costs
actually incurred for work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by
the Casualty Consultant, until such time as fifty percent (50%) of the
Restoration has been completed as certified by the Casualty Consultant. The
Casualty Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth above in this Section 5.3.2(d), be less than the amount
actually held back by Borrower from contractors, subcontractors and materialmen
engaged in the Restoration. The Casualty Retainage shall not be released until
the Casualty Consultant certifies to Agent that the Restoration has been
completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.3.2(d) and in
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements and Agent receives evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Agent that the costs of the Restoration have been
paid in full or will be paid in full out of the Casualty Retainage; provided,
however, that Agent will release the portion of the Casualty Retainage being
held with respect to any contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in the
Restoration as of the date upon which the Casualty Consultant certifies to Agent
that the contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily completed
all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with the provisions of the
contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's contract, the contractor,
subcontractor or materialman delivers the lien waivers and evidence of payment
in full of all sums due to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may
be reasonably requested by Agent or by the title company issuing the Title
Insurance Policy, and the conditions set forth in clauses (I), (II) and (III) of
Section 5.3.2(b) have been satisfied. If required by Agent, the release of any
such portion of the Casualty Retainage shall be approved by the surety company,
if any, which has issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the
contractor, subcontractor or materialman.

                  (e) Agent shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the
Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

                  (f) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance
thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Agent in consultation with the
Casualty Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which
are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be incurred in connection with the
completion of the Restoration, Borrower shall, at its option, (i) deposit with
Agent an amount equal to the deficiency (the "NET PROCEEDS DEFICIENCY"), (ii)
pay for costs actually incurred in connection with the Restoration, as incurred,
in the amount of the Net Proceeds Deficiency so that the amount of Net Proceeds
that remains to be disbursed shall be sufficient to pay all remaining costs of
the Restoration and Borrower shall furnish Agent with such evidence thereof as
Agent shall reasonably require, or (iii) post with Agent a Letter of Credit in
an amount equal to the Net Proceeds Deficiency, in any case, before any further


                                     -118-
<PAGE>
disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made. If Borrower deposits Net
Proceeds Deficiency as aforesaid, the same with Agent shall be held by Agent and
shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with the
Restoration on the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net
Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant to this Section 5.3.2 shall constitute
additional security for the Debt. Borrower hereby agrees that Agent, for the
benefit of Lenders, shall have a Lien and security interest in any sums
deposited pursuant to clause (i) above and Borrower shall have no right to
withdraw any such sums except for the payment of the aforesaid costs of
Restoration as approved by Agent.

                  (g) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining
balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Agent after the
Casualty Consultant certifies to Agent that the Restoration has been completed
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.3.2, and the receipt by
Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent that all costs incurred in
connection with the Restoration have been paid in full, shall be remitted by
Agent to Borrower, provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be
continuing under any of the Building Loan Documents and provided, however, that
with respect to an Award, no amounts shall be remitted to Borrower in excess of
the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Agent.

                  (h) All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for
the Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds
pursuant to Section 5.3.2(g) may be retained and applied by Agent toward the
payment of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority
and proportions as Agent in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, at the
discretion of Agent, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part, to
Borrower for such purposes as Agent shall designate.

                  (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower elects to
convert the Property to condominium form of ownership in accordance with Section
4.1.37, from and after the Condominium Conversion, Agent's rights and
obligations with respect to this Section 5.3.2 shall be subject to the terms of
the declaration of condominium, provided that if a Casualty shall occur at any
time after such Condominium Conversion and before the Loan is repaid in full,
the following provisions shall be applicable. If, pursuant to the declaration of
condominium and the Condominium Act, the Net Proceeds must be applied to
Restoration and the conditions set forth in Section 5.3.2(a)(iii) has been
satisfied but any of the other conditions set forth in Section 5.3.2(a) shall
not have been satisfied, Agent (on behalf of Lenders) shall have the right to
declare the Loan or so much thereof as shall be advanced and outstanding and any
and all other sums due and owing under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents immediately due and payable unless Agent shall have received a
completion guaranty from Vornado in form and substance substantially the same as
the Guaranty of Completion with respect to completion of the Restoration and a
carry guaranty from Alexander's in form and substance substantially the same as
the Guaranty of Carry Obligations with respect to the Carry Costs (as defined in
the Guaranty of Carry Costs) during the period of Restoration, in which case
(subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.3.2) Agent shall not have the
right to so declare the Loan due and payable by reason of the Net Proceeds being
so applied to the Restoration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if
Section 339-cc of the Condominium Act shall be applicable and if the conditions
set forth in Section 5.3.2(a) shall not have been satisfied, then if Borrower
votes its interests to restore in accordance with said Section 339-cc, Agent (on
behalf of Lenders) shall have the right to declare the Loan or so much thereof
as shall be advanced and outstanding and any and all


                                     -119-
<PAGE>
other sums due and owing under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
immediately due and payable. In any event, if the condition set forth in Section
5.3.2(a)(iii) has not been satisfied, Agent (on behalf of Lenders) shall have
the right to declare the Loan or so much thereof as shall be advanced and
outstanding and any and all other sums due and owing under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents immediately due and payable.

                  5.3.3 APPLICATION OF NET PROCEEDS. Upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, Agent, at its option, may withdraw all the Net Proceeds or the
undisbursed balance thereof and the remaining balance, if any, of the Net
Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Agent and may apply the such Net Proceeds and
Net Proceeds Deficiency either to the payment of Restoration or to payment of
the Debt (without premium or penalty, but subject to Section 2.2.7) in such
order, proportion and priority as Agent may determine in its sole discretion.
Agent's right to withdraw and apply such Net Proceeds and Net Proceeds
Deficiency shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided to
Agent under the Building Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Borrower elects to convert the Property to condominium form of ownership in
accordance with Section 4.1.37, from and after the Condominium Conversion,
Agent's rights and obligations with respect to this Section 5.3.3 shall be
subject to the terms of the declaration of condominium.

                  5.3.4 DISBURSEMENT DIRECTION. Borrower hereby authorizes Agent
to disburse the Net Proceeds to Vornado instead of to Borrower at anytime that
Vornado is performing under its Guaranty of Completion or as otherwise required
pursuant to such Guaranty of Completion.

                  VI. NET CASH FLOW FUNDS

                  SECTION 6.1 DEPOSITS OF NCF FUNDS.

                  6.1.1 DEPOSIT OF NCF FUNDS. During any Cash Trap Period,
Borrower shall deposit with Agent all Net Cash Flow as provided in Section
4.1.11.

                  6.1.2 RELEASE OF NCF FUNDS. Provided no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall be entitled to release of NCF Funds
at the end of a Cash Trap Period; provided that upon the occurrence of any
subsequent Trigger Event, Borrower shall again be required to deposit Net Cash
Flow with Agent in accordance with Section 4.1.11.

                  SECTION 6.2 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

                  SECTION 6.3 SECURITY INTEREST IN FUNDS.

                  6.3.1 GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. Borrower shall be the owner
of (i) the Net Proceeds Deficiency, if any, deposited with Lender after a
Casualty or Condemnation, (ii) the payments, if any, received by Agent from the
Counterparty under and pursuant to any Assignment of Interest Rate Protection
Agreement and (iii) the NCF Funds (collectively, the "FUNDS"). Borrower hereby
pledges, assigns and grants a security interest to Agent for the benefit of
Agent and Lenders, as security for payment of the Total Debt and the performance
of all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Loan Documents on Borrower's
part to be paid


                                     -120-
<PAGE>
and performed, in all of Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the
Funds. The Funds shall be under the sole dominion and control of Agent.

                  6.3.2 PROHIBITION AGAINST FURTHER ENCUMBRANCE. Borrower shall
not, without the prior consent of Agent, further pledge, assign or grant any
security interest in the Funds or permit any lien or encumbrance to attach
thereto, or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements,
except those naming Agent as the secured party, to be filed with respect
thereto.

                  6.3.3 APPLICATION OF FUNDS. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, Agent, at its option, may withdraw the Funds and apply the Funds to
payment of the Total Debt in such order, proportion and priority as Lender may
determine in its sole discretion. Agent's right to withdraw and apply the Funds
shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided to Agent or
Lenders under the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 6.4 CASH MANAGEMENT.

                  6.4.1 PERMITTED INVESTMENTS. Agent shall invest any balances
of the Funds in such Permitted Investments as Agent shall determine is
appropriate given the length of time that such Funds are to be invested, which
Permitted Investments shall be held in the name of and be under the sole
dominion and control of Agent and subject at all times to the terms hereof. No
investment shall be made unless Agent shall have and continue to have a
perfected first priority lien in such investment securing the obligations of
Borrower hereunder and under the other Building Loan Documents and all filings
and other actions necessary to ensure the validity, perfection, and first
priority of such lien shall have been taken. Agent shall have no liability for
any loss of such funds that are invested in investments and no such loss shall
affect Borrower's obligations to make the deposits required under Section 6.1.

                  6.4.2 EARNINGS ON FUND COLLATERAL; MONTHLY STATEMENTS. All
interest or other income (whether by virtue of permitted investments or
otherwise) accruing on such funds shall, in each case, be held as if a part of
the funds so invested. All risk of loss in respect of the investments shall be
borne by Borrower. Agent shall provide to Lenders and Borrower a monthly
statement of account showing deposits into and disbursements (or transfers or
reallocations, as the case may be) with respect to the funds.

                  6.4.3 INCOME TAXES. Borrower shall report on its federal,

                  SECTION 7.1 THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.

                  Borrower shall not enter into any agreement relating to the
management or operation of the Property without the express consent of Agent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that such consent may
be conditioned upon the manager under such agreement and Borrower executing a
subordination of management fees substantially in the form annexed hereto as
SCHEDULE XXXI. From and after such time as Borrower shall have


                                     -121-
<PAGE>
entered into a Management Agreement, Borrower shall exercise Borrower's rights
under the Management Agreement against Manager so that Manager manages the
Property in accordance with the Management Agreement. Borrower shall (i)
diligently perform and observe all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the
Management Agreement on the part of Borrower to be performed and observed, (ii)
promptly notify Agent of any notice to Borrower of any default by Borrower in
the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
the Management Agreement on the part of Borrower to be performed and observed
and (iii) promptly notify Agent of any default by Manager in the performance or
observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Management
Agreement on the part of Manager to be performed and observed. If Borrower shall
default in the performance or observance of any material term, covenant or
condition of the Management Agreement on the part of Borrower to be performed or
observed, then, without limiting Agent's other rights or remedies under this
Agreement or the other Building Loan Documents, and without waiving or releasing
Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder or under the Management
Agreement, Agent shall have the right, but shall be under no obligation, to pay
any sums and to perform any act as may be appropriate to cause all the material
terms, covenants and conditions of the Management Agreement on the part of
Borrower to be performed or observed. The provisions of this Section 7.1 shall
no longer be applicable in respect of the Residential Component from and after
the occurrence of any Condominium Conversion, provided that Borrower agrees that
after any such Condominium Conversion for so long as Borrower owns any
Residential Units, Borrower shall not vote to enter into any agreement relating
to the management or operation of the Residential Component without the express
consent of Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  SECTION 7.2 PROHIBITION AGAINST TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION.

                  Borrower shall not surrender, terminate, cancel, modify, renew
or extend the Management Agreement, or enter into any other agreement relating
to the management or operation of the Property with Manager or any other Person,
or consent to the assignment by the Manager of its interest under the Management
Agreement, in each case without the express consent of Agent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, with respect to a new
manager such consent may be conditioned upon such new manager and Borrower
executing an assignment of management agreement and subordination of management
fees substantially in the form of the Assignment of Management Agreement and
Subordination of Fees dated the Closing Date.

                  SECTION 7.3 REPLACEMENT OF MANAGER.

                  Agent shall have the right to require Borrower to replace the

option, selected by Agent in its sole discretion, upon the occurrence of any one
or more of the following events: (i) at any time following the occurrence of an
Event of Default and/or (ii) at any time that the Manager has engaged in (x)
gross negligence, (y) fraud or (z) willful misconduct.

                  VIII. TRANSFERS

                  SECTION 8.1 AGENT'S AND LENDERS' RELIANCE.

                  Borrower acknowledges that Agent and Lenders have examined and
relied on the experience of Borrower and its general partners, members,
principals and (if Borrower is a trust) beneficial owners in owning and
operating properties such as the Property in agreeing to enter into this
Agreement and make the Building Loan, the Supplemental Loan and the Project Loan
and will continue to rely on Borrower's ownership of the Property as a means of
maintaining the value of the Property as security for repayment of the Total
Debt and the performance of Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents.
Borrower acknowledges that Agent and Lenders have a valid interest in
maintaining the value of the Property so as to ensure that, should Borrower
default in the repayment of the Total Debt or the performance of Borrower's
obligations under the Loan Documents, Agent and Lenders can recover the Total
Debt by a sale of the Property.

                  SECTION 8.2 NO TRANSFERS.

                  Except for Permitted Transfers, Borrower shall not Transfer
the Property or any part thereof or permit or suffer the Property or any part
thereof to be Transferred or permit any other Transfer to occur, unless Agent
shall consent thereto in writing, in Agent's sole and absolute discretion. The
subordination by Agent of the Liens of the Mortgage to the ZLDA shall not be
deemed to impair, abridge or otherwise affect the restrictions on Transfers set
forth in this Agreement and the Mortgage, which shall remain in full force and

         fifteen (15) days after notice from Agent in the case of any other

         extended for such time as is reasonably necessary for Borrower in the
         exercise of due diligence to cure such Default, such additional period
         not to exceed ninety (90) days;

                  (xiv) if any other such event shall occur or condition shall

                  (xxiv)if, after Borrower shall have elected to convert the

         within the applicable grace or cure period provided in the by-laws of
         the condominium.

                  (b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an
Event of Default described in clauses (vii), (viii) or (ix) above) and at any
time thereafter Agent may, in addition to any other rights or remedies available
to it pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or at law or in
equity, take such action, without notice or demand, that Agent deems advisable
to protect and enforce its rights against Borrower and in and to the Property,
including, without limitation, declaring the Total Debt to be immediately due
and payable, and Agent may enforce or avail itself of any or all rights or
remedies provided in the Loan Documents against Borrower and the Property,
including without limitation, all rights or remedies available at law or in
equity; and upon any Event of Default described in clauses (vii), (viii) or (ix)
above, the Total Debt and all other obligations of Borrower hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents shall immediately and automatically become due and
payable, without notice or demand, and Borrower hereby expressly waives any such

                  SECTION 9.2 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF AGENT AND LENDERS.

                  9.2.1 REMEDIES. (a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, all or any one or more of the rights, powers, privileges and other
remedies available to Agent against Borrower under this Agreement or any of the
other Building Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to,
Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised by Agent at any time and from
time to time, whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be declared due and
payable, and whether or not Agent shall have commenced any foreclosure
proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and remedies under
any of the Building Loan Documents with respect to the Property or the Cash
Collateral. Any such actions taken by Agent shall be cumulative and


                                     -127-
<PAGE>
concurrent and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Agent may determine in its sole
discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law, without impairing or
otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Agent permitted by law,
equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other Building Loan
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower agrees
that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if an Event of Default
is continuing (i) Agent is not subject to any "one action" or "election of
remedies" law or rule, and (ii) all liens and other rights, remedies or
privileges provided to Agent shall remain in full force and effect until Agent
has exhausted all of its remedies against the Property and the Building Loan
Mortgage has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in
satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in full.

                  (b) Agent shall have the right from time to time following the
occurrence of an Event of Default to partially foreclose the Building Loan
Mortgage in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Building Loan Mortgage
then due and payable as determined by Agent in its sole discretion including,
without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in the event Borrower
defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more
scheduled payments of principal and interest, Agent may foreclose the Building
Loan Mortgage to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event Agent
elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance of the
Loan, Agent may foreclose the Building Loan Mortgage to recover so much of the
principal balance of the Building Loan as Agent may accelerate and such other
sums secured by the Building Loan Mortgage as Agent may elect. Notwithstanding
one or more partial foreclosures, the Property shall remain subject to the
Building Loan Mortgage to secure payment of sums secured by the Building Loan
Mortgage and not previously recovered.

                  (c) Agent shall have the right from time to time to sever the
Building Loan Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes,
mortgages and other security documents (the "SEVERED LOAN DOCUMENTS") in such
denominations as Agent shall determine in its sole discretion for purposes of
evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder. Borrower
shall execute and deliver to Agent from time to time, promptly after the request
of Agent, a severance agreement and such other documents as Agent shall request
in order to effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent. Borrower hereby absolutely
and irrevocably appoints Agent as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an
interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or
desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its
said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided, however, Agent shall not
make or execute any such documents under such power until three (3) Business
Days after notice has been given to Borrower by Agent of Agent's intent to
exercise its rights under such power. Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any
costs or expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution,
recording or filing of the Severed Loan Documents, and the Severed Loan
Documents shall not contain any representations, warranties or covenants not
contained in the Building Loan Documents and any such representations and
warranties contained in the Severed Loan Documents will be given by Borrower
only as of the Closing Date or the date of the last Advance made hereunder or
under the Project Loan Agreement, whichever is later.

                  (d) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Agent may
declare Lenders' obligations to make Advances hereunder to be terminated,
whereupon the same shall terminate,


                                     -128-
<PAGE>
and/or declare all unpaid principal of and accrued interest on the Building Loan
Note, together with all other sums payable under the Building Loan Documents, to
be immediately due and payable, whereupon same shall become and be immediately
due and payable, anything in the Building Loan Documents to the contrary
notwithstanding, and without presentation, protest or further demand or notice
of any kind, all of which are expressly hereby waived by Borrower; provided,
however, that Lenders may make Advances or parts of Advances thereafter without
thereby waiving the right to demand payment of the Building Loan Note, without
becoming liable to make any other or further Advances, and without affecting the
validity of or enforceability of the Building Loan Documents. Notwithstanding
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing or anything else to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, Lenders' obligations to make Advances hereunder shall automatically
terminate.

                  (e) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, subject to
Agent's first providing Vornado with an opportunity to assume responsibility for
the construction of the Improvements in accordance with the Guaranty of
Completion, Agent may cause the Improvements to be completed and may enter upon
the Property and construct, equip and complete the Improvements in accordance
with the Plans and Specifications, with such changes therein as Agent may, from
time to time, and in its sole discretion, deem appropriate. In connection with
any construction of the improvements undertaken by Agent pursuant to the
provisions of this subsection, Agent may:

                  (i) use any funds of Borrower, including any balance which may
         be held by Agent as security or in escrow, and any funds remaining
         unadvanced under the Building Loan;

                  (ii) employ existing contractors, subcontractors, including
         Major Trade Contractors, agents, architects, engineers, and the like,
         or terminate the same and employ others;

                  (iii) employ security watchmen to protect the Property;

                  (iv) make such additions, changes and corrections in the Plans
         and Specifications as shall, in the judgment of Agent, be necessary or
         desirable;

                  (v) take over and use any and all Personal Property contracted
         for or purchased by Borrower, if appropriate, or dispose of the same as
         Agent sees fit;

                  (vi) execute all applications and certificates on behalf of
         Borrower which may be required by any Governmental Authority or Law or
         Regulation or contract documents or agreements;

                  (vii) pay, settle or compromise all existing or future bills
         and claims which are or may be liens against the Property, or may be
         necessary for the Completion of the Improvements or the clearance of
         title to the Property, including, without limitation, all taxes and
         assessments;

                  (viii)complete the marketing and sale of Residential Units and
         Commercial Units, and complete the marketing and leasing of leasable
         space in the Improvements,


                                     -129-
<PAGE>
         enter into new leases and occupancy agreements of the Residential Units
         or Commercial Units, and modify or amend existing leases and occupancy
         agreements, all as Agent shall deem to be necessary or desirable;

                  (ix) prosecute and defend all actions and proceedings in
         connection with the construction of the Improvements or in any other
         way affecting the Property, the Improvements and take such action and
         require such performance as Agent deems necessary under the Payment and
         Performance Bonds; and

                  (x) take such other action hereunder, or refrain from acting
         hereunder, as Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, from time
         to time determine, and without any limitation whatsoever, to carry out
         the intent of this Section 9.21.

Borrower shall be liable to Agent for all costs paid or incurred for the
construction, completion and equipping of the Improvements, whether the same
shall be paid or incurred pursuant to the provisions of this Section or
otherwise, and all payments made or liabilities incurred by Agent hereunder of
any kind whatsoever shall be deemed advances made to Borrower under this
Agreement and shall be secured by the Building Loan Mortgage and the other
Building Loan Documents.

                  To the extent that any costs so paid or incurred by Agent,
together with all other Advances made by Lenders hereunder, exceed the Building
Loan Amount, such excess costs shall be paid by Borrower to Agent on demand,
with interest thereon at the Default Rate until paid; and Borrower shall execute
such notes or amendments to the Building Loan Note as may be requested by Agent
to evidence Borrower's obligation to pay such excess costs and until such notes
or amendments are so executed by Borrower, Borrower's obligation to pay such
excess costs shall be deemed to be evidenced by this Agreement. In the event
Agent takes possession of the Property and assumes control of such construction
as aforesaid, Agent shall not be obligated to continue such construction longer
than Agent shall see fit and may thereafter, at any time, change any course of
action undertaken by it or abandon such construction and decline to make further
payments for the account of Borrower whether or not the Property shall have been
completed. For the purpose of this Section, the construction, equipping and
completion of the Property shall be deemed to include any action necessary to
cure any Event of Default by Borrower under any of the terms and provisions of
any of the Building Loan Documents.

                  (f) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Agent may
appoint or seek appointment of a receiver, without notice and without regard to
the solvency of Borrower or the adequacy of the security, for the purpose of
preserving the Property, preventing waste, and to protect all rights accruing to
Agent and/or Lenders by virtue of this Agreement and the other Building Loan
Documents, and expressly to do any further acts as Agent may determine to be
necessary to complete the development and construction of the Improvements. All
expenses incurred in connection with the appointment of such receiver, or in
protecting, preserving, or improving the Property, shall be charged against
Borrower and shall be secured by the Building Loan Mortgage and enforced as a
lien against the Property.

                  (g) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Agent may
accelerate maturity of the Building Loan Note and any other indebtedness of
Borrower to Lenders, and demand


                                     -130-
<PAGE>
payment of the principal sum due thereunder, with interest, advances, costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses (including those for appellate
proceedings), and enforce collection of such payment by foreclosure of the
Building Loan Mortgage or the enforcement of any other collateral, or other
appropriate action.

                  9.2.2 POWER OF ATTORNEY. For the purposes of carrying out the
provisions and exercising the rights, powers and privileges granted by or
referred to in this Agreement, Borrower hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Agent its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power of
substitution, to execute, acknowledge and deliver any instruments and do and
perform any acts which are referred to in this Agreement, in the name and on
behalf of Borrower after the occurrence of an Event of Default. The power vested
in such attorney-in-fact is, and shall be deemed to be, coupled with an interest
and irrevocable.

                  9.2.3 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default, the rights, powers and privileges provided in this Article IX and all
other remedies available to Agent and Lenders under this Agreement or under any
of the other Building Loan Documents or at law or in equity may be exercised by
Agent and Lenders at any time and from time to time and shall not constitute a
waiver of Agent's or any of Lenders' other rights or remedies thereunder,
whether or not the Building Loan shall be due and payable, and whether or not
Agent shall have instituted any foreclosure proceedings or other action for the
enforcement of its rights under the Building Loan Documents.

                  9.2.4 ANNULMENT OF DEFAULTS. An Event of Default shall not be
deemed to be in existence for any purpose of this Agreement or any Loan Document
if Agent shall have waived such Event of Default in writing or stated that the
same has been cured to its reasonable satisfaction, but no such waiver shall
extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any of the rights
of Lenders upon the occurrence thereof.

                  9.2.5 WAIVERS. Borrower hereby waives to the extent not
prohibited by applicable law (a) all presentments, demands for payment or
performance, notices of nonperformance (except to the extent required by the
provisions hereof or of any other Building Loan Documents), protests and notices
of dishonor, (b) any requirement of diligence or promptness on Agent's or
Lenders' part in the enforcement of its rights (but not fulfillment of its
obligations) under the provisions of this Agreement or any other Building Loan
Document, and (c) any and all notices of every kind and description which may be
required to be given by any statute or rule of law.

                  9.2.6 COURSE OF DEALING, ETC. No course of dealing and no
delay or omission by Agent, Lenders or Borrower in exercising any right or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right or
remedy and no single or partial exercise thereof shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. A waiver
on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right or
remedy on any future occasion. No waiver or consent shall be binding upon
Lenders unless it is in writing and signed by Agent. Agent's exercise of Agent's
right to remedy any default by Borrower to Lenders or any other person, firm or
corporation shall not constitute a waiver of the default remedied, a waiver of
any other prior or subsequent default by Borrower or a waiver of the right to be
reimbursed for any and all of its expenses in so remedying such default. The
making of an


                                     -131-
<PAGE>
Advance hereunder during the existence of an Event of Default shall
not constitute a waiver thereof. All rights and remedies of Lenders hereunder
are cumulative. No Advance of Building Loan proceeds hereunder, no increase or
decrease in the amount of any Advance, and no making of all or any part of an
Advance prior to the due date thereof shall constitute an approval or acceptance
by Lenders of the work theretofore done or a waiver of any of the conditions of
Lenders' obligation to make further Advances, nor in the event Borrower is
unable to satisfy any such condition, shall any such failure to insist upon
strict compliance have the effect of precluding Lenders from thereafter refusing
to make an Advance and/or declaring such inability to be an Event of Default as
hereinabove provided. All Advances shall be deemed to have been made pursuant
hereto and not in contravention of the terms of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.3 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

                  The rights, powers and remedies of Agent under this Agreement
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which
Agent may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Agent's rights, powers
and remedies may be pursued singly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time and
in such order as Agent may determine in Agent's sole discretion. No delay or
omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of
Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a
waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or
Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver
of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any
remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

                  X. MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 10.1 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  All covenants, promises and agreements in this Agreement, by
or on behalf of Borrower, shall inure to the benefit of the respective legal
representatives, successors and assigns of Agent and Lenders.

                  SECTION 10.2 AGENT'S AND LENDER'S DISCRETION.

                  Whenever, pursuant to this Agreement, Agent and/or a Lender
exercises any right given to it to approve or disapprove, or any arrangement or
term is to be satisfactory to Agent and/or any Lender, the decision of Agent
and/or such Lender to approve or disapprove or to decide whether arrangements or
terms are satisfactory or not satisfactory shall (except as is otherwise
specifically herein provided) be in the sole discretion of Agent and/or such
Lender, as applicable, and shall be final and conclusive.

                  SECTION 10.3 GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION AND AGENT FOR

                  No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination
or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document, nor
consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective

                  SECTION 10.5 DELAY NOT A WAIVER.

                  Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Agent and/or
Lenders in insisting upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or
agreement, or exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or

particular, and not by way of limitation, by accepting payment after the due
date of any amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document,

Document providing for


                                     -135-
<PAGE>
deemed approval or consent if Agent does not respond within a specified number
of days (such provision being herein referred to as a "deemed approval
mechanism"), Borrower shall be required to mark such notice and the envelope
containing same "URGENT" and include a warning thereon that: AGENT'S FAILURE TO
RESPOND WITHIN _*__ DAYS OF THE RECEIPT THEREOF WILL RESULT IN THE REQUESTED
CONSENT OR APPROVAL BEING DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN GRANTED. Any such notice that
fails to provide such warning shall not be deemed to have been properly given

applicable number of days]

                  SECTION 10.7 TRIAL BY JURY.

                  BORROWER, AGENT AND EACH LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREE NOT TO ELECT
A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER
ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS
GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER, AGENT AND EACH LENDER, AND IS
INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH THE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. BORROWER, AGENT AND EACH LENDER
ARE EACH HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN ANY PROCEEDING AS
CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER.

                  SECTION 10.8 HEADINGS.

                  The Article and/or Section headings and the Table of Contents
in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and
shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

                  SECTION 10.9 SEVERABILITY.

                  Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.10 PREFERENCES.

                  Each Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to
apply or reverse and reapply any and all payments by Borrower to any portion of
the obligations of Borrower hereunder. To the extent Borrower makes a payment or
payments to Agent or any Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under
any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then,
to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations hereunder or
part thereof intended to be


                                     -136-
<PAGE>
satisfied shall be revived and continue in full force and effect, as if such
payment or proceeds had not been received by Agent or such Lender.

                  SECTION 10.11 WAIVER OF NOTICE.

                  Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature
whatsoever from Agent or Lenders except with respect to matters for which this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the
giving of notice by Agent and/or Lenders to Borrower and except with respect to
matters for which Borrower is not, pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements,
permitted to waive the giving of notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the
right to receive any notice from Agent and/or any Lender with respect to any
matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan Documents do not specifically
and expressly provide for the giving of notice by Agent and/or such Lender to
Borrower.

                  SECTION 10.12 REMEDIES OF BORROWER.

                  In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Agent
or any Lender or its agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed
acting in any case where, by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, Agent or such Lender or such agent, as the case may be, has an
obligation to act reasonably or promptly, Borrower's sole remedy shall be
limited to commencing an action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory
judgment and neither Agent nor such Lender nor its agents shall be liable for
any monetary damages unless in a final judgment of a court having jurisdiction,
it is determined that Agent or such Lender not only acted unreasonably but
arbitrarily and capriciously and in bad faith as well. Any action or proceeding
to determine whether Agent or a Lender has acted reasonably shall be determined
by an action seeking declaratory judgment. Any expedited procedure legally
available with such a declaratory judgment action or action for injunctive
relief may be utilized to the extent possible.

                  SECTION 10.13 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY.

                  (a) Borrower shall pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, shall
reimburse Agent upon receipt of notice and demand from Agent, for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements)
incurred by Agent in connection with (i) Borrower's ongoing performance of and
compliance with Borrower's agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after
the Closing Date, including, without limitation, confirming compliance with
environmental and insurance requirements; (ii) Agent's ongoing performance of
and compliance with all agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the
Closing Date; (iii) the preparation for and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Agreements or for the performance
hereof and of the other Loan Documents, and for any services which may be
required in addition to those normally and reasonably contemplated hereby and
thereby or which may be required in the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any subordination, non-disturbance
and attornment agreement or lease approvals, the release of Residential Units or
other documents or matters requested by Borrower; (iv) the filing and recording
fees and expenses, title insurance and reasonable fees and


                                     -137-
<PAGE>
expenses of counsel for providing to Agent all required legal opinions, and
other similar expenses incurred, in creating and perfecting the Liens in favor
of Agent pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (v) enforcing
or preserving any rights, in response to third party claims or the prosecuting
or defending of any action or proceeding or other litigation, in each case
against, under or affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
the Property, or any other security given for the Loan; and (vi) enforcing any
obligations of or collecting any payments due from Borrower under this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect to the Property or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements
provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency
or bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable
for the payment of any such costs and expenses to Agent to the extent the same
arise by reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
misconduct of Agent.

                  (b) Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Agent
and each Lender, each participant in the Loan, and their respective officers,
directors, partners, employees and agents (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from
and against, and shall reimburse the affected Indemnified Party for, any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for
Agent in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial
proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not Agent shall be designated a
party thereto) (collectively, "LOSSES"), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against such Indemnified Party in any manner relating to or arising out
of (i) any breach by Borrower of its obligations under, or any material
misrepresentation by Borrower contained in, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, (ii) the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan or (iii) any
other matter arising from this Agreement or the Loan (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided, however, that Borrower shall not have any
obligation to such Indemnified Party hereunder to the extent that such
Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party. To the extent that the undertaking
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may
be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall
pay the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable
law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
such Indemnified Party.

                  (c) In case any such claim, action or proceeding (a "CLAIM")
is brought against an Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnification may
be sought by such Indemnified Party pursuant hereto, Agent shall give prompt
written notice thereof to Borrower, which notice shall include all documents and
information in the possession of or under the control of Agent and such
Indemnified Party relating to such Claim and shall specifically state that
indemnification for such Claim is being sought under this Section 10.13;
provided, however, that the failure of Agent to so notify Borrower shall not
limit or affect such Indemnified Party's rights to be indemnified pursuant to
this Section 10.13 except to the extent Borrower is materially prejudiced by
such failure. Upon receipt of such notice of Claim (together with such documents
and information from Agent and such Indemnified Party), Borrower shall, at its
sole cost and expense, in good faith defend any such Claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Agent and such Indemnified Party (it being understood
that counsel selected by Borrower's insurance carrier shall be deemed to be
acceptable to Agent and such Indemnified Party, provided such insurer is an
acceptable


                                     -138-
<PAGE>
insurer under the Loan Documents or otherwise was accepted by Agent as an
insurer), which counsel may, without limiting the rights of Agent and such
Indemnified Party pursuant to the next succeeding sentence of this Section
10.13, also represent Borrower in such investigation, action or proceeding. In
the alternative, such Indemnified Party may elect to conduct its own defense
through counsel of its own choosing and at the reasonable expense of Borrower,
if (A) such Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the conduct of its
defense by Borrower could be materially prejudicial to its interests, (B)
Borrower refuses to defend, or (C) Borrower shall have failed, in such
Indemnified Party's reasonable judgment, to defend the Claim in good faith
(unless such Claim is being defended by Borrower's insurance carrier, provided
such insurer is an acceptable insurer under the Loan Documents or otherwise was
accepted by Agent as an insurer). Borrower may settle any Claim against such
Indemnified Party without such Indemnified Party's consent, provided (i) such
settlement is without any liability, cost or expense whatsoever to such
Indemnified Party, (ii) the settlement does not include or require any admission
of liability or culpability by such Indemnified Party under any federal, state
or local statute or regulation, whether criminal or civil in nature and (iii)
Borrower obtains an effective written release of liability for such Indemnified
Party from the party to the Claim with whom such settlement is being made, which
release must be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party, and a dismissal
with prejudice with respect to all claims made by the party against such
Indemnified Party in connection with such Claim. Agent and such Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with Borrower, at Borrower's sole cost and
expense, in connection with the defense or settlement of any Claim in accordance
with the terms hereof. If Borrower refuses to defend any Claim or fails to
defend such Claim in good faith (other than a Claim that is being defended by
Borrower's carrier, provided such insurer is an acceptable insurer under the
Loan Documents or otherwise was accepted by Agent as an insurer) and such
Indemnified Party elects to defend such Claim by counsel of its own choosing
Borrower shall be responsible for any good faith settlement of such Claim
entered into by such Indemnified Party. If such Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that the conduct of its defense by Borrower could be materially
prejudicial to its interests and elects to defend such Claim by counsel of its
own choosing, Borrower shall be responsible for any reasonable settlement of
such Claim entered into by such Indemnified Party. Except as provided in the
preceding two (2) sentences, no Indemnified Party may pay or settle any Claim
and seek reimbursement therefor under this Section 10.13. Nothing contained
herein shall be construed as requiring Agent or any Indemnified Party to expend
funds or incur costs to defend any Claim in connection with the matters for
which Agent or any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 10.13. The obligations of Borrower hereunder shall specifically
include the obligation to expend its own funds, to incur costs in its own name
and to perform all actions as may be necessary to protect Agent or any other
Indemnified Party from the necessity of expending its own funds, incurring cost
or performing any actions in connection with the matters for which Agent or such
other Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder.

                  SECTION 10.14 SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS INCORPORATED.

                  The Schedules and Exhibits annexed hereto are hereby
incorporated herein as a part of this Agreement with the same effect as if set
forth in the body hereof.

                  SECTION 10.15 OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES.

                  Any assignee of Agent's or any Lender's interest in and to
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear
of all offsets, counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to such documents
which Borrower may otherwise have against any assignor of such documents, and no
such unrelated counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by
Borrower in any action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such
documents and any such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset,
counterclaim or defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly
waived by Borrower.

                  SECTION 10.16 NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP; NO THIRD PARTY
                                BENEFICIARIES.

                  (a) Borrower, Agent and Lenders intend that the relationships
created hereunder and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower
and lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture,
partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower
and Agent or Lenders nor to grant Agent or Lenders any interest in the Property
other than that of mortgagee, beneficiary or lender.

                  (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for
the benefit of Agent and Lenders and nothing contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Agent and
Lenders any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of
any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the
obligations of Lenders to make Advances of the Building Loan hereunder are
imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and no other
Person shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions in
accordance with their terms or be entitled to assume that Agent or Lenders will
refuse to make Advances of the Building Loan in the absence of strict compliance
with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any circumstances be
deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of which may be freely
waived in whole or in part by Agent on behalf of Lenders if, in Agent's sole
discretion, Agent deems it advisable or desirable to do so. In addition, no
Lender is the agent or representative of Borrower and this Agreement shall not
make any Lender liable to any Trade Contractor or any other Person for goods
delivered to or services performed by them upon the Property, or for debts or
claims accruing to such parties against Borrower and there is no contractual
relationship, either express or implied, between any Lender and any Trade
Contractor or any other Person supplying any work, labor or materials for the
Improvements.

                  SECTION 10.17 PUBLICITY.

                  (a) All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or
its Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which
refers to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan Documents
shall be subject to the prior reasonable approval of Agent except with respect
to disclosures that are required by law or applicable stock exchange
regulations.

                  (b) Agent shall have the right, subject to the prior
reasonable approval of Borrower except where disclosure is required by law or
applicable banking regulations, to issue


                                     -140-
<PAGE>
news releases, and publicize and/or advertise the fact that it has provided
financing with respect to the Property and in connection therewith Agent shall
have the right to photograph and use pictures of the Property in any such
advertisements, brochures, print, media and other copy.

                  (c) At Agent's request, Borrower, at Borrower's cost and
expense, shall erect a suitable sign or signs at the Property in a location
clearly visible to the public which shall indicate that financing for the
Property is being provided by Agent and Lenders and otherwise publicize Agent's
and each Lender's role in the financing. Borrower shall provide Agent with a
sign diagram showing the design plans and specifications for such sign, and it
shall be subject to Agent's prior written approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld). Agent shall coordinate the placement and maintenance of such signs on
the Property, and no Lender shall have any independent right to display any
signs on the Property. If after the initial sign is erected at the Property,
Agent requests that Borrower make any changes in such sign to reflect new
Lenders or otherwise and Borrower otherwise reasonably approves such change,
such changes to such sign shall be made by Borrower at Lenders' cost and
expense. Borrower shall have the right to remove any such sign after the
construction barricade at the Property is removed and shall have the right, from
time to time, at Borrower's cost and expense, to change any such sign to
accommodate construction requirements provided that as so changed, the sign
shall continue to publicize Agent's and each Lender's role in the financing in a
manner reasonably comparable to that provided by the sign prior to such change.

                  SECTION 10.18 [RESERVED.]

                  SECTION 10.19 WAIVER OF OFFSETS/DEFENSES/COUNTERCLAIMS.

                  Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim,
other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought
against it by Agent or Lenders or their agents or otherwise to offset any
obligations to make the payments required by the Loan Documents. No failure by
Agent or Lenders to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall be a valid
defense to, or result in any offset against, any payments which Borrower is
obligated to make under any of the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 10.20 CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; RELIANCE.

                  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Agreement and any of the other Building Loan Documents, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were
represented by competent counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting
and execution of the Building Loan Documents and that such Building Loan
Documents shall not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning
against the party that drafted same. Borrower acknowledges that, with respect to
the Building Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and advisors
in entering into the Building Loan without relying in any manner on any
statements, representations or recommendations of Agent or any Lender or any
parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Agent or such Lender. Neither Agent nor any
Lender shall be subject to any limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any
rights or remedies available to it under any of the Building Loan Documents or
any other agreements or instruments which govern the Loan by virtue of the
ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Agent or such Lender
of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower, and Borrower hereby


                                     -141-
<PAGE>
irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take any action on the
basis of the foregoing with respect to Agent's and/or Lenders' exercise of any
such rights or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Agent and each Lender
engages in the business of real estate financings and other real estate
transactions and investments that may be viewed as adverse to or competitive
with the business of Borrower or its Affiliates.

                  SECTION 10.21 BROKERS AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS.

                  Borrower hereby represents that it has dealt with no financial
advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement agents, agents or finders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Borrower shall
indemnify, defend and hold each Indemnified Party and its officers and directors
harmless from and against any Losses in any way relating to or arising from a
Claim by any Person that such Person acted on behalf of Borrower in connection
with the transactions contemplated herein. The provisions of this Section 10.21
shall survive the expiration and termination of this Agreement and the payment
of the Total Debt.

                  SECTION 10.22 PRIOR AGREEMENTS.

                  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such
parties, whether oral or written, including, without limitation, the Summary of
Terms and Conditions dated April 25, 2002 between Borrower and Lender, are
superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 10.23 JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY.

                  If Borrower is comprised of more than one Person, all
representations, warranties, covenants (both affirmative and negative) and all
other obligations hereunder shall be the joint and several obligation of each
entity making up Borrower and a Default or Event of Default by any such Person
shall be deemed a Default or Event of Default by all such entities and Borrower.
The representations, covenants and warranties contained herein or in any other
Building Loan Document shall be read to apply to the individual entities
comprising Borrower when the context so requires but a breach of any such
representation, covenant or warranty or a breach of any obligation under the
Building Loan Documents shall be deemed a breach by all such entities and
Borrower, entitling Agent and/or Lenders, as applicable, to exercise all of
their rights and remedies under all the Building Loan Documents and under
applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained,
except as provided in any Guaranty or in the Environmental Indemnity, no direct
or indirect member of Residential Owner or Commercial Owner, nor any principal,
director, officer or employee of any such member, shall have any personal
liability under the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 10.24 ASSIGNMENTS.

                  (a) Borrower may not assign this Agreement or any of its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior approval of Agent.


                                     -142-
<PAGE>
                  (b) No Lender shall assign, transfer, sell, pledge or
hypothecate all or any portion of its rights in and to the Loans to any other
Person (a Person to which any such assignment, transfer or sale is made in
accordance with this Article X being an "ASSIGNEE"):

                  (i) without the prior written consent of Agent, which consent
         shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall not be required if the
         Assignee is an Affiliate of such Lender and provided that such Lender
         shall not be released from its continuing obligations hereunder after
         such assignment to its Affiliate;

                  (ii) so long as no Event of Default shall exist, unless the
         Assignee is an Affiliate of such Lender or is an Eligible Assignee, and
         provided that such Lender shall not be released from its continuing
         obligations hereunder after such assignment to its Affiliate;

                  (iii) unless such transaction shall be an assignment of a
         constant and not a varying, ratable percentage of such Lender's
         interest in the Loan;

                  (iv) unless the aggregate principal amount of the Loan which
         is the subject of such transaction is Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000)
         or more;

                  (v) unless, after giving effect to such transaction, such
         Lender's aggregate unassigned interest in the Loan shall be in a
         principal amount of at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) unless
         such transaction encompasses all of such Lender's rights in and to the
         Loan in which case such Lender shall have assigned all of its rights in
         and to the Loan; and

                  (vi) in the case of an assignment, the parties to each such
         assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent, for its acceptance and
         recording the Agent's Register, Agent's form of assignment and
         acceptance agreement attached hereto as SCHEDULE XIII, with appropriate
         completions (each, an "ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE"), together with a
         processing and registration fee of $2,500, which fee shall cover
         Agent's cost in connection with the assignments under this Agreement.

                  (c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
subject to Section 11.4(f), Borrower's consent to any assignment or
participation to any party whatsoever shall not be required and all parties
hereto agree to promptly execute and file an amendment to this Agreement
reflecting any such assignment. Furthermore, if within seven (7) Business Days
after receiving a request pursuant to subparagraph (b) above for its consent to
any assignment or participation by any Lender, Borrower shall not have either
consented or withheld its consent (specifying the reasons therefor), then such
consent shall be deemed to have been given.

                  (d) Borrower agrees to execute, within ten (10) days after
request therefor is made by Agent, any documents and/or estoppel certificates
reasonably requested by Agent in connection with such participation or
assignment, without charge; provided that such documents and/or estoppel
certificates do not expand the liability or obligations of Borrower or reduce
assignee's or participant's obligations.


                                     -143-
<PAGE>
                  (e) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording,
from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance,
(x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party thereto and, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder
and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under
this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or
the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party thereto).

                  (f) Agent shall maintain a register (the "AGENT'S REGISTER")
showing the identity of the Lenders from time to time. The entries in the
Agent's Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and
Borrower, Agent and the Lenders may (and, in the case of any portion of the Loan
or other obligation hereunder not evidenced by a Note, shall) treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of such portion of the Loan
or other obligation hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the
contrary. Any assignment of any portion of the Loan or other obligation
hereunder not evidenced by a Note shall be effective only upon appropriate
entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. The Register shall be
available for inspection by Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (g) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender and an Assignee (and, in the case of an Assignee that is
not then a Lender or an affiliate thereof, by Borrower and Agent) together with
payment to Agent of a registration and processing fee of $2,500, Agent shall (i)
promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) on the effective date
determined pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the
Agent's Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the
Lenders and Borrower.

                  (h) Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
participant or Assignee of such Lender (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and any
prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's
possession concerning Borrower and its Affiliates which has been delivered to
such Lender by or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has
been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of Borrower in connection with
such Lender's credit evaluation of Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming
a party to this Agreement, provided that any disclosure of Bloomberg's financial
statements may only be made in accordance with the terms of the Bloomberg Lease
and subject to the confidentiality requirements thereof with respect to the
same.

                  (i) For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement
acknowledge that the provisions of this Section concerning assignments relate
only to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit
assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, any
pledge or assignment by a Lender of any Loan or Note to any Federal Reserve Bank
in accordance with applicable law.


                                     -144-
<PAGE>
                  (j) Borrower agrees that after the effective date under such
Assignment and Acceptance, upon the request to Agent by any Lender, Borrower
shall execute and deliver to such Lender one or more substitute notes of
Borrower evidencing such Lender's Ratable Share of the Building Loan,
Supplemental Loan and Project Loan, respectively, in substantially the same form
as the Building Loan Note, Supplemental Loan Note and Project Loan Note,
respectively, with appropriate insertions as to payee and principal amount. Each
such substitute note shall be dated as of the Closing Date.

                  (k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, HVB and Agent hereby agree for the benefit of Borrower that provided
no Event of Default exists, HVB shall not assign, without the consent of
Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), a
portion of the Loan which shall result in the Ratable Share of HVB in its
capacity as a Lender being less than, for so long as Lenders continue to have
any further funding obligations hereunder, One Hundred One Million and No/100
($101,000,000) Dollars of the Maximum Loan Commitment.

                  (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Borrower shall not be responsible for the costs incurred by any
Lender, Assignee or Agent in connection with any such Assignment and Acceptance.

                  (m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower consents to any assignment of
the Loan to Vornado or to any Person that is, directly or indirectly,
wholly-owned by Vornado.

                  SECTION 10.25 ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF.

                  (a) If any Lender (a "BENEFITED LENDER") shall at any time
receive any payment of all or part of its Ratable Share of the Loan, or interest
thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 9.1(a)(viii), or otherwise including pursuant to
subsection (b) below), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or
collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other
Lender's Ratable Share of the Loan, or interest thereon, such benefited Lender
shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such
portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be
necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits
of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest. Borrower agrees that each Lender so purchasing a
portion of another Lender's Ratable Share of the Loan may exercise all rights of
payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such
portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

                  (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to
Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by Borrower to the extent
permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due


                                     -145-
<PAGE>
and payable by Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Event of Default to
set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and
any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time
held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the
credit or the account of Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify
Borrower and Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender,
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
such set-off and application.

                  SECTION 10.26 COUNTERPARTS.

                  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be an original and all of which shall constitute together
but one and the same agreement.

                  XI. AGENT

                  SECTION 11.1 PERFORMANCE BY AGENT.

                  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
Agent shall have the right, but not the duty, without limitation, upon any of
Agent's rights pursuant hereto, to perform the obligations of Borrower which are
the subject of the Event of Default, in which event Agent shall endeavor to give
notice to Borrower of Agent's performance, and Borrower agrees to pay to Agent,
within five (5) days of demand therefor, all actual and reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Agent in connection therewith, including without limitation
reasonable attorneys' fees, together with interest from the date of expenditure
at the Default Rate, if an Event of Default shall have given rise to such
expenditure. Upon demand by Agent each of the Lenders shall promptly advance to
Agent in immediately available funds its ratable portion of the funds expended
by Agent in curing such Event of Default together with interest thereon at the
Default Rate from the date of Agent's payment through the date prior to the date
on which such advance is received by Agent.

                  SECTION 11.2 ACTIONS.

                  If Agent shall have reasonable cause to believe that any
action or proceeding related to the Property could, if adversely determined,
have a material adverse effect upon the rights or interests of Agent and/or
Lenders under this Agreement or any of the other Building Loan Documents, Agent
shall have the right to commence, appear in and defend such action or
proceeding, and in connection therewith Agent may pay necessary expenses, employ
counsel, and pay reasonable attorneys' fees. Borrower agrees to pay to Agent,
within thirty (30) days (or if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, within five (5) days) after demand therefor by Agent, all actual and
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Agent in connection therewith,
including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, together with interest
from the date of expenditure at the Default Rate, if an Event of Default shall
have given rise to such action or proceeding. Borrower's obligations to repay
such expenses shall be secured by the Building Loan Documents.


                                     -146-
<PAGE>
                  SECTION 11.3 NONLIABILITY OF AGENT AND LENDERS.

                  Borrower acknowledges and agrees that:

                  (a) any inspections of the construction of the Improvements
made by or through Agent or Lenders are for purposes of administration of the
Loan only and Borrower is not entitled to rely upon the same with respect to the
quality, adequacy or suitability of materials or workmanship, conformity to the
Plans and Specifications, state of completion or otherwise; Borrower shall make
its own inspections of such construction to determine that the quality of the
Improvements and all other requirements of such construction are being performed
in a manner satisfactory to Borrower and in conformity with the Plans and
Specifications and all other requirements; and Borrower shall immediately notify
Agent, in writing, should the same not be in conformity with the Plans and
Specifications and all other requirements;

                  (b) by accepting or approving anything required to be
observed, performed, fulfilled or given to Agent or Lenders pursuant to the Loan
Documents, including any certificate, statement of profit and loss or other
financial statement, survey, appraisal, lease or insurance policy, neither Agent
nor Lenders shall be deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency,
legality, effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision
or condition thereof and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not
constitute a warranty or representation to anyone with respect thereto by Agent;

                  (c) neither Agent nor Lenders undertake nor assume any
responsibility or duty to Borrower to select, review, inspect, supervise, pass
judgment upon or inform Borrower of any matter in connection with the Property,
including, without limitation, matters relating to the quality, adequacy or
suitability of: (i) the Plans and Specifications, (ii) architects, contractors,
subcontractors and materialmen employed or utilized in connection with the
construction of the Improvements, or the workmanship of or the materials used by
any of them, or (iii) the progress or course of construction and its conformity
or nonconformity with the Plans and Specifications; and Borrower shall rely
entirely upon its own judgment with respect to such matters, and any review,
inspection, supervision, exercise of judgment or supply of information to
Borrower by Agent or Lenders in connection with such matters is for the
protection of Agent and/or Lenders only and neither Borrower nor any third party
is entitled to rely thereon;

                  (d) neither Agent nor Lenders owe any duty of care to protect
Borrower against negligent, faulty, inadequate or defective building or
construction; and

                  (e) neither Agent nor any Lender shall be directly or
indirectly liable or responsible for any loss, claim, cause of action,
liability, indebtedness, damage or injury of any kind or character to any person
or property arising from any construction on, or occupancy or use of, any of the
Property, including without limitation any loss, claim, cause of action,
liability, indebtedness, damage or injury caused by, or arising from: (i) any
defect in any building, structure, grading, fill, landscaping or other
improvements, thereon or in any on-site or off-site improvement or other
facility therein or thereon; (ii) any act or omission of Borrower, the parties
comprising Borrower or any of Borrower's agents, employees, independent
contractors, licensees or invitees; (iii) any accident in or on the Land and
Improvements or any fire, flood or other casualty or hazard thereon; (iv) the
failure of Borrower, any of Borrower's licensees,


                                     -147-
<PAGE>
employees, invitees, agents, independent contractors or other representatives to
maintain the Property in a safe condition; and (v) any nuisance made or suffered
on any part of the Property.

                  SECTION 11.4 AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION.

                  (a) Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan
Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Any and all actions relating to
construction of the Improvements, including without limitation, approval of
changes to the Loan Budget, Plans and Specifications, contracts and subcontracts
and Payment and Performance Bonds, shall be deemed to have been delegated to
Agent exclusively and shall not constitute a Major Decision requiring the
approval of any other Lender. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of
the Note), Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Majority Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders;
provided, however, that Agent shall not be required to take any action which
exposes Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or
applicable law. Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each
material notice given to it by Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Documents.

                  (b) By their execution of this Agreement, all of the Lenders
hereby authorize and direct Agent to act on their behalf in all respects in
connection with the Loan Documents and the making of the Loan (but subject to
paragraph (e) below) and agree with Borrower that Borrower shall only be
required to and shall only deal with Agent and each of the Lenders shall be
bound by any acts of Agent.

                  (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
Agent (i) shall take all such actions hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents which are not inconsistent with the terms hereof or thereof as the
Majority Lenders shall instruct and (ii) shall not take any material actions
hereunder or under the Loan Documents contrary to the instructions of the
Majority Lenders (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from
acting upon such instructions) and such instructions shall be binding upon all
Lenders; provided, however, that the Majority Lenders shall not have the right
to require any Lender to fund its Ratable Share of any amount which is Advanced
in excess of the total amount of the Loan. Any provision of this Agreement which
grants to Agent the right to make a decision at its sole discretion or in its
reasonable judgment or at its option or any other similar provision is intended,
unless the context shall clearly require otherwise, to apply only to relations
between Borrower and Agent and the respective rights and obligations of Borrower
and Agent hereunder and shall not apply to the relations between Agent and the
Lenders or the respective rights and obligations of Agent and the Lenders
hereunder.

                  (d) Promptly after Agent acquires actual knowledge thereof,
Agent will give written notice to each Lender of any Lien on the Property or
material Default under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents which
in Agent's judgment adversely affects any of the Lenders' interests in the Loan.
Agent agrees to consult with Lenders in respect of any material remedial action
to be taken in respect of any such Default and shall act substantially in


                                     -148-
<PAGE>
accordance with any decision of the Majority Lenders (and shall be fully
protected in so acting). Agent agrees that during a period of forty-five (45)
days from Agent's notice to Lenders of any such Default, Agent will not take any
such material remedial action without the prior agreement of the Majority
Lenders unless in Agent's good faith judgment it is necessary to take more
prompt remedial action within such period, with or without the agreement of the
Majority Lenders, in order to preserve any collateral for the payment of the
Loan or substantive rights or remedies under any of the Loan Documents. Agent
shall advise Lenders from time to time of such remedial action as Agent shall
have taken. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Majority Lenders do not agree
on the action to be taken, except as expressly set forth in this Section, Agent
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, in each instance, without prior
notice to Lenders, to consent to any action or failure to act by Borrower, and
to exercise or refrain from exercising any powers or rights Agent may have under
or in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents relative
thereto or any collateral therefor, which would be reasonable. All losses and
expenses incurred by Agent in connection with the Loan, the enforcement thereof
or the realization of the security therefor shall be borne by the Lenders in
accordance with their ratable interest in the Loan, and Lenders will, upon
request, reimburse Agent for their Ratable Shares of any expenses incurred by
Agent in connection with any such default, any advances made to pay Taxes or
Insurance Premiums or Other Charges or otherwise to preserve the lien of the
Supplemental Loan Mortgage, Building Loan Mortgage or Project Loan Mortgage or
to preserve and protect the Property or made to effect the completion of the
Improvements to be constructed pursuant to this Agreement (provided that Agent
shall not advance sums in excess of the principal amount of the Supplemental
Loan Mortgage, Building Loan Mortgage or Project Loan Mortgage for completion of
the Improvements without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders), any
other expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of the Supplemental
Loan Mortgage, Building Loan Mortgage or Project Loan Mortgage, and any expenses
incurred by Agent in connection with the consummation of the Loan not paid or
provided for by Borrower.

                  (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents may be modified or
supplemented only by an instrument in writing signed by Borrower and Agent and
any provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents may be waived by
Agent, provided that no modification, supplement or waiver shall, unless by an
instrument signed by all of the Lenders or by Agent acting with the consent of
all of the Lenders, (i) increase or extend the term of the Loan except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii) extend the date fixed for
the payment of principal of or interest on the Loan or the amount of any fee
payable hereunder (other than the Administrative Fee), (iv) reduce the amount of
any such payment of principal or of any such fee, (iii) reduce the rate at which
interest is payable on the Loan, (v) alter the terms of Section 10.25 or this
Section 11.4, (vi) release, substitute or exchange any material portion of the
collateral for the Loan except in accordance with the provisions of the Loan
Documents related thereto, (vii) modify the definition of the term "Majority
Lenders" or modify in any other manner the number or percentage of the Lenders
required to make any determinations or receive any rights hereunder or to modify
any provision hereof or of any other Loan Document, (viii) modify or waive the
Debt Service Coverage Ratio or Loan-to-Value requirements set forth herein,
including without limitation modify the definition of the term "Debt Service
Coverage Ratio" or "Loan-to-Value," (ix) release any Guarantor or any other
Person liable on the Loan from any of their material obligations with respect to
the Loan or the completion of the Improvements,


                                     -149-
<PAGE>
(x) subordinate the Liens created by the Loan Documents to any other liens
securing indebtedness of Borrower or otherwise, (any such modification,
supplement or waiver described in this clauses (i) through (xi) and any other
action that expressly requires the consent of all Lenders hereunder is herein
referred to as a "MAJOR DECISION"); and provided further, that any modification
or supplement of Article XI hereof, or of any of the rights or duties of Agent
hereunder, shall require the consent of Agent. The provisions of this subsection
are solely for the benefit of the Lenders and Agent and shall not create any
rights in Borrower. The provisions of this subsection are solely for the benefit
of the Lenders and Agent and shall not create any rights in Borrower.

                  (f) Provided Majority Lenders have designated a successor
agent as provided below, Majority Lenders shall have the right to remove Agent
for cause, by written notice to Borrower and Agent to be effective as to
Borrower only if, as and when such notice is actually received by Borrower and
Agent. If Agent shall resign as administrative agent hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents (which Agent may so resign upon thirty (30) days written
notice to Borrower and each Lender), or if the Majority Lenders shall remove
Agent, then the Majority Lenders shall designate another Lender to perform the
obligations and exercise the rights of Agent hereunder. The successor Agent
shall assume such obligations in writing and from and after Borrower's receipt
of a copy of notice of such replacement and receipt of a copy of such assumption
the successor Agent shall be the sole Agent hereunder and the term "AGENT" shall
thereafter refer to such successor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HVB agrees
for the benefit of Borrower that it shall not resign as Agent prior to the
Initial Maturity Date for so long as (i) Lenders continue to have any further
funding obligations hereunder, (ii) no Event of Default exists, (iii) HVB is
generally engaged in the business of being an administrative agent for
construction loans in the United States and (iv) the other Lenders do not have
the right to remove HVB as Agent for cause as provided herein.

                  SECTION 11.5 AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC.

                  Agent shall administer this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and service the Loan in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and with the same degree of care as Agent would use in servicing
a loan of similar size and type held for its own account; provided, however,
that none of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection
with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Agent: (i) may
consult with legal counsel (including counsel for Borrower), independent public
accountants and other experts selected and shall not be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice
of such counsel, accountants or experts; (ii) makes no warranty or
representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any
statements, warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made in or
in connection with this Agreement; (iii) shall not have any duty to ascertain or
to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement on the part of Borrower or to inspect the Property
(including the books and records) of Borrower; (iv) shall not be responsible to
any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto; and (v) shall incur no liability under or in
respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or
other


                                     -150-

instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier, telegram, cable or telex)
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

                  SECTION 11.6 AGENT AS A LENDER.

                  With respect to Agent's ownership interest in the Loan and the
Loan Documents as a Lender, Agent in its capacity as a Lender shall have the
rights and powers of a Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
as set forth herein and therein and may exercise the same as though it were not
Agent.

                  SECTION 11.7 DISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS BY AGENT TO LENDERS.

                  Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender its Ratable
Share of any payment on account of principal or interest or any extension fee
received by Agent by credit to an account of such Lender at Agent or by wire
transfer to an account of such Lender in accordance with written wiring
instructions received by Agent from such Lender, or to such other Person or in
such other manner as such Lender may designate, provided any other designated
account is maintained at a commercial bank located in the United States of
America. If any payments are received by Agent after 11:00 a.m. (New York time),
then provided Agent shall not be able to distribute to each Lender its Ratable
Share of any such payment on the same day as such payment is received by Agent,
Agent shall hold such payment to the extent not so distributed for the benefit
of the respective Lenders ratably, shall invest any such Lender's Ratable Share
not so distributed in overnight federal funds for the benefit of such Lender and
such Lender shall be entitled to receive its Ratable Share of such payment
together with interest earned thereon on the following Business Day. The
provisions of this Section 11.7 are subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in Section 2.10.4(c) as to any Defaulting Lender.

                  SECTION 11.8 ASSIGNMENT UPON REPAYMENT

                  Upon repayment or prepayment of the Loan in full by Borrower
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
Lenders shall, on a one-time basis, assign the Note and Agent shall assign the
Mortgage, each without recourse, covenant or warranty of any nature, express or
implied, (except if any Lender is not delivering the original Note, in which
case such Lender shall execute and deliver a "lost note affidavit" in its
customary form with respect to the copy of its Note) to such new mortgagee
designated by Borrower (other than Borrower or a nominee of Borrower); provided
that Borrower (i) has caused to be paid the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of
Agent and Lenders incurred in connection therewith and Agent's and Lenders'
reasonable attorneys' fees for the preparation, delivery and performance of such
an assignment, (ii) has caused the delivery of an executed Statement of Oath
under Section 275 of the New York Real Property Law; and (iii) has provided such
other information and documents which a prudent mortgagee would reasonably
require to effectuate such assignment. Borrower shall be responsible for all
mortgage recording taxes (if any), recording fees and other charges payable in
connection with any such assignment.
