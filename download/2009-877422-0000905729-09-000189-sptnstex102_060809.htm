Each Borrower and Guarantor assumes all risks for, and agrees to pay, all foreign, Federal, State and local taxes, duties and levies relating to any goods subject to any Letter of Credit Accommodations or any documents, drafts or acceptances thereunder. Each Borrower and Guarantor hereby releases and holds Agent and Lenders harmless from and against any acts, waivers, errors, delays or omissions, whether caused by any Borrower, Guarantor, by any issuer or correspondent or otherwise with respect to or relating to any Letter of Credit Accommodation, except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Agent or any Lender as determined pursuant to a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. The provisions of this Section 2.2(f) shall survive the payment of Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (g) In connection with Inventory purchased pursuant to Letter of Credit Accommodations, Borrowers and Guarantors shall, at Agent's request, instruct all suppliers, carriers, forwarders, customs brokers, warehouses or others receiving or holding cash, checks, Inventory, documents or instruments in which Agent holds a security interest to, at such time as Agent may request, deliver them to Agent and/or subject to Agent's order, and if they shall come into such Borrower's or Guarantor's possession, to deliver them, upon Agent's request, to Agent in their original form, <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, Agent shall not exercise its rights under this clause (g) to have such persons deliver any cash, checks or Inventory to Agent unless a Default or Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing.. Borrowers and Guarantors shall also, at Agent's request, designate Agent as the consignee on all bills of lading and other negotiable and non-negotiable documents.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (h) Each Borrower and Guarantor hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs any issuer of a Letter of Credit Accommodation to name such Borrower or Guarantor as the account party therein and to deliver to Agent all instruments, documents and other writings and property received by issuer pursuant to the Letter of Credit Accommodations and to accept and rely upon Agent's instructions and agreements with respect to all matters arising in connection with the Letter of Credit Accommodations or the applications therefor.

kind with respect to any Letter of Credit Accommodation provided by an issuer other than Agent or any Lender unless Agent has duly executed and delivered to such issuer the application or a guarantee or indemnification in writing with respect to such Letter of Credit Accommodation. Borrowers and Guarantors shall be bound by any reasonable interpretation made in good faith by Agent, or any other issuer or correspondent under or in connection with any Letter of Credit Accommodation or any documents, drafts or acceptances thereunder, notwithstanding that such interpretation may be inconsistent with any instructions of any Borrower or Guarantor, except as to any issuer without limiting the rights of any Borrower or Guarantor as against any issuer to the extent provided in clause (m) below.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) So long as no Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, a Borrower may (i) approve or resolve any questions of non-compliance of documents, (ii) give any instructions as to acceptance or rejection of any documents or goods, (iii) execute any and all applications for steamship or airway guaranties, indemnities or delivery orders, and (iv) with Agent's consent, grant any extensions of the maturity of, time of payment for, or time of presentation of, any drafts, acceptances, or documents, and agree to any amendments, renewals, extensions, modifications, changes or cancellations of any of the terms or conditions of any of the applications, Letter of Credit Accommodations, or documents, drafts or acceptances thereunder or any letters of credit included in the Collateral.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (j) At any time an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, Agent shall have the right and authority to, and Borrowers shall not, without the prior written consent of Agent, (i) approve or resolve any questions of non-compliance of documents, (ii) give any instructions as to acceptance or rejection of any documents or goods, (iii) execute any and all applications for steamship or airway guaranties, indemnities or delivery orders, (iv) grant any extensions of the maturity of, time of payments for, or time of presentation of, any drafts, acceptances, or documents, and (v) agree to any amendments, renewals, extensions, modifications, changes or cancellations of any of the terms or conditions of any of the applications, Letter of Credit Accommodations, or documents, drafts or acceptances thereunder or any letters of credit included in the Collateral. Agent may take such actions either in its own name or in any Borrower's name.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (k) Any rights, remedies, duties or obligations granted or undertaken by any Borrower or Guarantor to any issuer or correspondent in any application for any Letter of Credit Accommodation, or any other agreement in favor of any issuer or correspondent relating to any Letter of Credit Accommodation, shall be deemed to have been granted or undertaken by such Borrower or Guarantor to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders. Any duties or obligations undertaken by Agent to any issuer or correspondent in any application for any Letter of Credit Accommodation, or any other agreement by Agent in favor of any issuer or correspondent to the extent relating to any Letter of Credit Accommodation, shall be deemed to have been undertaken by Borrowers and Guarantors to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders and to apply in all respects to Borrowers and Guarantors.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (l) Immediately upon the issuance or amendment of any Letter of Credit Accommodation, each Lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to<BR>

the extent of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the liability with respect to such Letter of Credit Accommodation (including, without limitation, all Obligations with respect thereto).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (m) Each Borrower is irrevocably and unconditionally obligated, without presentment, demand or protest, to pay to Agent any amounts paid by an issuer of a Letter of Credit Accommodation with respect to such Letter of Credit Accommodation (whether through the borrowing of Loans in accordance with Section 2.2(a) or otherwise); provided, that, nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit or waive any right of any Borrower to assert against an issuer of a Letter of Credit Accommodation any claim for direct damages suffered by such Borrower to the extent caused by the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit Accommodation issued by it complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit Accommodation. In the event that any Borrower fails to pay Agent on the date of any payment under a Letter of Credit Accommodation in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, Agent (to the extent it has actual notice thereof) shall promptly notify each Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such payment and each Lender agrees, upon one (1) Business Day's notice, to fund to Agent the purchase of its participation in such Letter of Credit Accommodation in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the unpaid amount. The obligation of each Lender to deliver to Agent an amount equal to its respective participation pursuant to the foregoing sentence is absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be made notwithstanding the occurrence or continuance of any Event of Default, the failure to satisfy any other condition set forth in Section 4 or any other event or circumstance. If such amount is not made available by a Lender when due, Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount was due until the date such amount is paid to Agent at the interest rate then payable by any Borrower in respect of Loans that are Prime Rate Loans as set forth in Section 3.1(a) hereof.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.3 <U>Commitments</U>. The aggregate amount of each Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations shall not exceed the amount of such Lender's Commitment, as the same may from time to time be amended in accordance with the provisions hereof.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4 <U>Joint and Several Liability</U>. All Borrowers shall be jointly and severally liable for all amounts due to Agent and Lenders under this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements, regardless of which Borrower actually receives the Loans or Letter of Credit Accommodations hereunder or the amount of such Loans received or the manner in which Agent or any Lender accounts for such Loans, Letter of Credit Accommodations or other extensions of credit on its books and records. All references herein or in any of the other Financing Agreements to any of the obligation of Borrowers to make any payment hereunder or thereunder shall constitute joint and several obligations of Borrowers. The Obligations with respect to Loans made to a Borrower, and the Obligations arising as a result of the joint and several liability of a Borrower hereunder, with respect to Loans made to the other Borrowers, shall be separate and distinct obligations, but all such other Obligations shall be primary obligations of all Borrowers. The Obligations arising as a result of the joint and several liability of a Borrower hereunder with respect to Loans, Letter of Credit Accommodations or other extensions of credit made to the other Borrowers shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be unconditional irrespective of (a) the validity or enforceability, avoidance or subordination of the Obligations of the other<BR>

Borrowers or of any promissory note or other document evidencing all or any part of the Obligations of the other Borrowers, (b) the absence of any attempt to collect the Obligations from the other Borrowers, any Guarantor or any other security therefor, or the absence of any other action to enforce the same, (c) the waiver, consent, extension, forbearance or granting of any indulgence by Agent or any Lender with respect to any provisions of any instrument evidencing the Obligations of the other Borrowers, or any part thereof, or any other agreement now or hereafter executed by the other Borrowers and delivered to Agent or any Lender, (d) the failure by Agent or any Lender to take any steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its rights and maintain its security or collateral for the Obligations of the other Borrowers, (e) the election of Agent and Lenders in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, (f) the disallowance of all or any portion of the claim(s) of Agent or any Lender for the repayment of the Obligations of the other Borrowers under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (g) any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor or of the other Borrowers other than to the extent of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Agent or a Lender as determined pursuant to a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. With respect to the Obligations arising as a result of the joint and several liability of a Borrower hereunder with respect to Loans, Letter of Credit Accommodations or other extensions of credit made to the other Borrowers hereunder, each Borrower waives, until the Obligations shall have been paid in full and this Agreement shall have been terminated, any right to enforce any right of subrogation or any remedy which Agent or any Lender now has or may hereafter have against any Borrower or Guarantor and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to Agent or any Lender. Upon any Event of Default, and for so long as such Event of Default is continuing, Agent may proceed directly and at once, without notice, against any Borrower to collect and recover the full amount, or any portion of the Obligations, without first proceeding against the other Borrowers or any other Person, or against any security or collateral for the Obligations. Each Borrower consents and agrees that Agent and Lenders shall be under no obligation to marshall any assets in favor of Borrower(s) or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 <U>Interest</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, interest on the outstanding principal amount of the Loans at the Interest Rate. All interest accruing hereunder on and after the date of any Event of Default or termination hereof shall be payable on demand.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Each Borrower may from time to time request Eurodollar Rate Loans or may request that Prime Rate Loans be converted to Eurodollar Rate Loans or that any existing Eurodollar Rate Loans continue for an additional Interest Period. Such request from a Borrower shall specify the amount of the Eurodollar Rate Loans or the amount of the Prime Rate Loans to be converted to Eurodollar Rate Loans or the amount of the Eurodollar Rate Loans to be continued (subject to the limits set forth below) and the Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, three (3) Business Days after receipt by Agent of such a request from a Borrower, such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made or Prime Rate Loans shall be converted to Eurodollar Rate Loans or such Eurodollar<BR>

Rate Loans shall continue, as the case may be, <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, (i) no Default or Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, (ii) no party hereto shall have sent any notice of termination of this Agreement, such Borrower shall have complied with such customary procedures as are established by Agent and specified by Agent to Lead Borrower from time to time for requests by Borrowers for Eurodollar Rate Loans, (iii) no more than eight (8) Interest Periods may be in effect at any one time, (iv) the amount of any Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be not less than $1,000,000 and the aggregate amount of the Eurodollar Rate Loans outstanding at any time must be in an amount not less than $5,000,000, and (v) Agent and each Lender shall have determined that the Interest Period or Adjusted Eurodollar Rate is available to Agent and such Lender and can be readily determined as of the date of the request for such Eurodollar Rate Loan by such Borrower. Any request by or on behalf of a Borrower for Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Prime Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans or to continue any existing Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be irrevocable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Agent and Lenders shall not be required to purchase United States Dollar deposits in the London interbank market or other applicable Eurodollar Rate market to fund any Eurodollar Rate Loans, but the provisions hereof shall be deemed to apply as if Agent and Lenders had purchased such deposits to fund the Eurodollar Rate Loans.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall automatically convert to Prime Rate Loans upon the last day of the applicable Interest Period, unless Agent has received and approved a request to continue such Eurodollar Rate Loan at least three (3) Business Days prior to such last day in accordance with the terms hereof. Any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall, at Agent's option, upon notice by Agent to Parent, be subsequently converted to Prime Rate Loans in the event that this Agreement shall terminate or not be renewed. Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, upon demand by Agent (or Agent may, at its option, charge any loan account of any Borrower) any amounts required to compensate any Lender or Participant for any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by such person, as a result of the conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Prime Rate Loans pursuant to any of the foregoing.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) Interest shall be payable by Borrowers to Agent, for the account of Lenders, monthly in arrears not later than the first day of each calendar month and shall be calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed. The interest rate on non-contingent Obligations (other than Eurodollar Rate Loans) shall increase or decrease by an amount equal to each increase or decrease in the Prime Rate effective on the first day of the month after any change in such Prime Rate is announced based on the Prime Rate in effect on the last day of the month in which any such change occurs. In no event shall charges constituting interest payable by Borrowers to Agent and Lenders exceed the maximum amount or the rate permitted under any applicable law or regulation, and if any such part or provision of this Agreement is in contravention of any such law or regulation, such part or provision shall be deemed amended to conform thereto.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 <U>Fees</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the account of Lenders, monthly an unused line fee at a rate equal to one-quarter (1/4%) percent per annum calculated upon the amount by which the Maximum Credit (less any reduction in the Fixed Asset Availability effected in accordance with the proviso to the definition thereof) exceeds the average daily principal balance<BR>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Borrowers agree to pay to Agent the other fees and amounts set forth in the Fee Letter in the amounts and at the times specified therein.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 <U>Changes in Laws and Increased Costs of Loans</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) If after the date hereof, either (i) any change in, or in the interpretation of, any law or regulation is introduced, including, without limitation, with respect to reserve requirements, applicable to Lender or any banking or financial institution from whom any Lender borrows funds or obtains credit necessary to fund the Loans hereunder (a "Funding Bank"), or (ii) a Funding Bank or any Lender complies with any future guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority or (iii) a Funding Bank or any Lender determines that the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof has or would have the effect described below, or a Funding Bank or any Lender complies with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, and in the case of any event set forth in this clause (iii), such adoption, change or compliance has or would have the direct or indirect effect of reducing the rate of return on any Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration the Funding Bank's or Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, and the result of any of the foregoing events described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) is or results in an increase in the cost to any Lender of funding or maintaining the Loans, the Letter of Credit Accommodations or its Commitment, then Borrowers and Guarantors shall from time to time upon demand by Agent pay to Agent additional amounts sufficient to indemnify Lenders against such increased cost on an after-tax basis (after taking into account applicable deductions and credits in respect of the amount indemnified). A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost shall be submitted to Lead Borrower by Agent and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) If prior to the first day of any Interest Period, (i) Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrowers and Guarantors) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, (ii) Agent has received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lenders of making or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans during such Interest Period, or (iii) Dollar deposits in the principal amounts of the Eurodollar Rate Loans to which such Interest Period is to be applicable are not generally available in the London interbank market, Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to Lead Borrower as soon as practicable thereafter, and will also give prompt written notice to Lead Borrower when such conditions no longer exist. If such<BR>

notice is given (A) any Eurodollar Rate Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Prime Rate Loans, (B) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be converted to or continued as Prime Rate Loans and (C) each outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period thereof, to Prime Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by Agent, no further Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall any Borrower have the right to convert Prime Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any law, treaty, rule or regulation or final, non-appealable determination of an arbitrator or a court or other Governmental Authority or in the interpretation or application thereof occurring after the date hereof shall make it unlawful for Agent or any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (i) Agent or such Lender shall promptly give written notice of such circumstances to Lead Borrower (which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such circumstances no longer exist), (ii) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Loans, continue Eurodollar Rate Loans as such and convert Prime Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall forthwith be canceled and, until such time as it shall no longer be unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Lender shall then have a commitment only to make a Prime Rate Loan when a Eurodollar Rate Loan is requested and (iii) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Rate Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Prime Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, Borrowers and Guarantors shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.3(d) below.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) Borrowers and Guarantors shall indemnify Agent and each Lender and to hold Agent and each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which Agent or such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) default by a Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or extension of Eurodollar Rate Loans after such Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Loan Agreement, (ii) default by any Borrower in making any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan after such Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and (iii) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. With respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or extended, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or extend to the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or extend, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Rate Loans provided for herein <U>over</U> (B) the amount of interest (as determined by such Agent or such Lender) which would have accrued to Agent or such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. This covenant shall survive the termination or non-renewal of this Loan Agreement and the payment of the Obligations.</P>

The foregoing indemnity shall survive the payment of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (f) Each Lender requiring compensation pursuant to Section 3.3(a), 3.3(d) or 3.3(e) shall notify Borrowers and Agent in writing of any event or circumstance giving rise to such demand for compensation no later than ninety (90) days following the date upon which the Lender has actual knowledge of such event or circumstance. Any demand for compensation pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be in writing and shall state the amount due, if any, under Section 3.3(d) or 3.3(e) and shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount.

In the event that any one or more Lenders, pursuant to Section 3.3(a) or Section 3.3(e) hereof, incur any increased costs or taxes (other than increased costs to the extent such increased costs are not a recurring cost) for which any such Lender demands compensation pursuant to Section 3.3(a) or Section 3.3(e) hereof which increases the effective lending rate of such Lender with respect to its share of the Loans to greater than one-eighth (1/8%) percent in excess of the percentage of the effective lending rate of the other US Lenders and such Lender has not mitigated such costs within sixty (60) days after receipt by such Lender from Lead Borrower of a written notice that such Lender's effective lending rate has so exceeded the effective lending rate of the other Lenders, then and in any such event, Lead Borrower may substitute another financial institution which is an Eligible Transferee acceptable to Agent for such Lender to assume the Commitment of such Lender and to purchase the Loans of such Lender hereunder, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Lender for a purchase price equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans owing to such Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest on such Loans and accrued but unpaid fees and other amounts in respect of such Lender's Commitment and share of the Loans (other than any early termination fee). Upon such purchase such Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights or benefits hereunder (except for rights or benefits that such Lender would retain hereunder and under the other Financing Agreements upon payment in full of all of the Obligations other than as to any early termination fee) and the replacement Lender shall succeed to the rights and benefits, and shall assume the obligations, of such Lender hereunder and<BR>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) Borrowers and Guarantors shall take any other actions reasonably requested by Agent from time to time to cause the attachment, perfection and first priority of, and the ability of Agent to enforce, the security interest of Agent in any and all of the Collateral, including, without limitation, (i) executing, delivering and, where appropriate, filing financing statements and amendments relating thereto under the UCC or other applicable law, to the extent, if any, that any Borrower's or Guarantor's signature thereon is required therefor, (ii) causing Agent's name to be noted as secured party on any certificate of title for a titled good if such notation is a condition to attachment, perfection or priority of, or ability of Agent to enforce, the security interest of Agent in such Collateral, (iii) complying with any provision of any statute, regulation or treaty of the United States as to any Collateral if compliance with such provision is a condition to attachment, perfection or priority of, or ability of Agent to enforce, the security interest of Agent in such Collateral, (iv) obtaining the consents and approvals of any Governmental Authority or third party, including, without limitation, any consent of any licensor, lessor or other person obligated on Collateral, and taking all actions required by any earlier versions of the UCC or by other law, as applicable in any relevant jurisdiction.</P>

<P><B>SECTION 6 <U>COLLECTION AND ADMINISTRATION</U></B></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.1 <U>Borrowers' Loan Accounts</U>. Agent shall maintain one or more loan account(s) on its books in which shall be recorded (a) all Loans, Letter of Credit Accommodations and other Obligations and the Collateral, (b) all payments made by or on behalf of any Borrower or Guarantor and (c) all other appropriate debits and credits as provided in this Agreement, including fees, charges, costs, expenses and interest.

extent that Agent receives a written notice from Lead Borrower of any specific exceptions of Lead Borrower thereto within forty-five (45) days after the date such statement has been received by Parent. Until such time as Agent shall have rendered to Lead Borrower a written statement as provided above, the balance in any Borrower's loan account(s) shall be presumptive evidence of the amounts due and owing to Agent and Lenders by Borrowers and Guarantors.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.3 <U>Collection of Accounts</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Each Borrower and Guarantor shall establish and maintain, at its expense, deposit account arrangements and merchant payment arrangements with the banks set forth on Schedule 8.10 to the Information Certificate and subject to Section 5.2(d) hereof such other banks as such Borrower or Guarantor may hereafter select. The banks set forth on Schedule 8.10 to the Information Certificate constitute all of the banks with which Borrowers and Guarantors have deposit account arrangements and merchant payment arrangements as of the date hereof and identifies each of the deposit accounts at such banks that are used solely for receiving store receipts from a retail store location of a Borrower (together with any other deposit accounts at any time established or used by any Borrower for receiving such store receipts from any retail store location, collectively, the "Store Accounts" and each individually, a "Store Account") or otherwise describes the nature of the use of such deposit account by such Borrower.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) Each Borrower shall deposit all proceeds from sales of Inventory in every form, including, without limitation, cash, checks, credit card sales drafts, credit card sales or charge slips or receipts and other forms of daily store receipts, from each retail store location of such Borrower (other than Medicare Accounts and Medicaid Accounts) into the Store Account of such Borrower used solely for such purpose in accordance with the current practices of such Borrower as of the date hereof, but in any event no less frequently than once every three (3) Business Days; <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, each retail store of a Borrower may retain in such store funds of up to $15,000 immediately after each deposit of funds from such store into the applicable Store Account. All such funds deposited into the Store Accounts shall be sent by wire transfer or other electronic funds transfer on each Business Day to the Blocked Accounts as provided in Section 6.3(a)(ii) below, except nominal amounts which are required to be maintained in such Store Accounts under the terms of such Borrower's arrangements with the bank at which such Store Accounts are maintained (which amounts, together with all amounts held at the retail store locations and not yet deposited in the Store Accounts, shall not in the aggregate exceed $5,000,000 at any one time, <U>except</U> to the extent from time to time additional amounts may be held in the retail stores or the Store Accounts on Saturday, Sunday or other days where the applicable depository bank is closed, which additional amounts are to be, and shall be, transferred on the next Business Day to the Blocked Accounts) and except as Agent may otherwise agree.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, each Borrower shall establish and maintain a separate lockbox and related deposit account into which such Borrower shall promptly deposit, and shall direct each Fiscal Intermediary or other Third Party Payor in accordance with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid regulations to directly remit, all payments in respect of any Medicare Accounts or Medicaid Accounts. Such separate lockboxes and related deposit accounts shall only be used for purposes of receiving payments in respect of Medicare Accounts and Medicaid Accounts and shall be under the sole control of the applicable<BR>

Borrower; <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, (A) Borrowers shall authorize, direct and instruct the depository banks at which such separate lockboxes and deposit accounts are maintained to remit by federal funds wire transfer all funds received or deposited into such lockboxes and related deposit accounts amounts on deposit in such accounts on a daily basis to one of the Blocked Accounts or such bank account of Agent as Agent may from time to time designate for such purpose, which instructions by Borrowers to such banks may only be changed after not less than three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to such banks and Agent and (B) any change in such instructions without the prior written consent of Agent shall be an Event of Default hereunder.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii) Each Borrower shall establish and maintain, at its expense, deposit accounts with such banks as are reasonably acceptable to Agent (the "Blocked Accounts") into which each Borrower shall promptly either cause all amounts on deposit in the Store Accounts of such Borrower to be sent as provided in Section 6.3(a)(i) above or shall itself deposit or cause to be deposited all proceeds of Receivables or other Collateral, including all proceeds from sales of Inventory, all amounts payable to each Borrower from Credit Card Issuers and Credit Card Processors and all other proceeds of Collateral (but not including payments of Medicare Accounts or Medicaid Accounts that are sent to the separate lockbox and related deposit accounts established pursuant to clause (ii) above).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iv) Borrowers and Guarantors shall deliver, or cause to be delivered to Agent a Deposit Account Control Agreement duly authorized, executed and delivered by each bank where a Blocked Account is maintained as provided in Section 5.2 hereof. At any time a Default or an Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, promptly upon Agent's request, Borrowers and Guarantors shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Agent a Deposit Account Control Agreement duly authorized, executed and delivered by such banks where a Store Account is maintained as Agent shall specify. Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Agent or Lenders, Agent may, at its option, instruct the depository banks at which the Blocked Accounts are maintained to transfer all available funds received or deposited into the Blocked Accounts to the Agent Payment Account at any time that either: (A) an Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, or (B) at any time prior to December 31, 2004, Excess Availability is less than $20,000,000 or at any time on and after December 31, 2004, Excess Availability is less than $30,000,000. Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Agent or Lenders, in the event that a Deposit Account Control Agreement is in effect for a Store Account, then Agent may, at its option, instruct the depository bank at which the Store Account is maintained to transfer all available funds received or deposited into the Store Account to the Agent Payment Account at any time that an Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing. As to the Blocked Accounts or the Store Accounts, as the case may be, Agent shall send to Lead Borrower a copy of any such written instruction sent by Agent to the depository bank promptly thereafter. In the event that at any time ninety (90) days after Agent has instructed such depository banks to transfer such funds to the Agent Payment Account, the Monthly Average Excess Availability for any calendar month commencing after the end of such ninety (90) day period is greater than $20,000,000 for any month ending on or before December 31, 2004 or $30,000,000 for any month ending thereafter and so long as no Event of Default exist or have occurred, upon Lead Borrower's written request received by Agent within five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction of such conditions, Agent shall rescind its prior instructions and give new instructions to such depository banks to transfer the funds on deposit in such accounts to such operating deposit account of Borrowers and Guarantors as Lead Borrower may<BR>

specify in writing to Agent until such time as Agent is entitled to notify and shall notify the depository bank otherwise as provided above. At all times that Agent shall have notified any depository bank to transfer funds from a Blocked Account or Store Account to the Agent Payment Account, all payments made to such Blocked Accounts or Store Accounts, whether in respect of the Receivables, as proceeds of Inventory or other Collateral or otherwise shall be treated as payments to Agent in respect of the Obligations and therefore shall constitute the property of Agent and Lenders to the extent of the then outstanding Obligations.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) For purposes of calculating the amount of the Loans available to each Borrower, such payments will be applied (conditional upon final collection) to the Obligations on the Business Day of receipt by Agent of immediately available funds in the Agent Payment Account provided such payments and notice thereof are received in accordance with Agent's usual and customary practices as in effect from time to time and within sufficient time to credit the applicable loan account on such day, and if not, then on the next Business Day. For the purposes of calculating interest on the Obligations, such payments or other funds received will be applied (conditional upon final collection) to the Obligations one (1) Business Day following the date of receipt of immediately available funds by Agent in the Agent Payment Account provided such payments or other funds and notice thereof are received in accordance with Agent's usual and customary practices as in effect from time to time and within sufficient time to credit the applicable loan account on such day, and if not, then on the next Business Day. In the event that at any time or from time to time there are no Loans outstanding or the amounts on deposit in the Blocked Accounts are not being remitted to the Agent Payment Account, Agent shall be entitled to an administrative fee in an amount calculated based on the Interest Rate for Eurodollar Rate Loans (on a per annum basis) then in effect multiplied by the amount of the funds received in the Blocked Account for such day in accordance with the customary practice of Agent. The economic benefit of the timing in the application of payments (and the administrative fee with respect thereto, if applicable) shall be for the sole benefit of Agent.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Each Borrower and Guarantor and their respective employees, agents and Subsidiaries shall, acting as trustee for Agent, receive, as the property of Agent, any monies, checks, notes, drafts or any other payment relating to and/or proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral which come into their possession or under their control and promptly upon receipt thereof, shall deposit or cause the same to be deposited in the Blocked Accounts, or remit the same or cause the same to be remitted, in kind, to Agent. In no event shall the same be commingled with any Borrower's or Guarantor's own funds. Borrowers agree to reimburse Agent on demand for any amounts owed or paid to any bank or other financial institution at which a Blocked Account or any other deposit account or investment account is established or any other bank, financial institution or other person involved in the transfer of funds to or from the Blocked Accounts arising out of Agent's payments to or indemnification of such bank, financial institution or other person. The obligations of Borrowers to reimburse Agent for such amounts pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.4 <U>Payments</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) All Obligations shall be payable to the Agent Payment Account as provided in Section 6.3 or such other place as Agent may designate from time to time.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) unless so directed by Lead Borrower, or unless a Default or an Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, Agent shall not apply any payments which it receives to any Eurodollar Rate Loans, except (A) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such Eurodollar Rate Loans or (B) in the event that there are no outstanding Prime Rate Loans and (ii) to the extent any Borrower uses any proceeds of the Loans or Letter of Credit Accommodations to acquire rights in or the use of any Collateral or to repay any Indebtedness used to acquire rights in or the use of any Collateral, payments in respect of the Obligations shall be deemed applied first to the Obligations arising from Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations that were not used for such purposes and second to the Obligations arising from Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations the proceeds of which were used to acquire rights in or the use of any Collateral in the chronological order in which such Borrower acquired such rights in or the use of such Collateral.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) At Agent's option, all principal, interest, fees, costs, expenses and other charges provided for in this Agreement or the other Financing Agreements may be charged directly to the loan account(s) of any Borrower maintained by Agent. Borrowers and Guarantors shall make all payments to Agent and Lenders on the Obligations free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any setoff, counterclaim, defense, duties, taxes, levies, imposts, fees, deductions, withholding, restrictions or conditions of any kind. If after receipt of any payment of, or proceeds of Collateral applied to the payment of, any of the Obligations, Agent or any Lender is required to surrender or return such payment or proceeds to any Person for any reason, then the Obligations intended to be satisfied by such payment or proceeds shall be reinstated and continue and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Agent or such Lender. Borrowers and Guarantors shall be liable to pay to Agent, and do hereby indemnify and hold Agent and Lenders harmless for the amount of any payments or proceeds surrendered or returned. This Section 6.4(b) shall remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may be taken by Agent or any Lender in reliance upon such payment or proceeds. This Section 6.4 shall survive the payment of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.5 <U>Authorization to Make Loans</U>.

All requests for Loans or Letter of Credit Accommodations hereunder shall specify the date on which the requested advance is to be made or Letter of Credit Accommodations established (which day shall be a Business Day) and the amount of the requested Loan. Requests received after 11:00 a.m. Chicago time on any day shall be deemed to have been made as of the opening of business on the immediately following Business Day. All Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations under this Agreement shall be conclusively presumed to have been made to, and at the request of and for the benefit of, any Borrower or Guarantor when deposited to the credit of any Borrower or Guarantor or otherwise disbursed or established in accordance with the instructions of any Borrower or Guarantor or in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.6 <U>Use of Proceeds</U>. Borrowers shall use the initial proceeds of the Loans provided by Agent to Borrowers hereunder only for: (a) payments to each of the persons listed in the disbursement direction letter furnished by Borrowers to Agent on or about the date hereof and (b) costs, expenses and fees in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements. All other Loans made or Letter of Credit Accommodations provided to or for the benefit of any Borrower pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be used by such Borrower only for general operating, working capital and other proper corporate purposes of such Borrower not otherwise prohibited by the terms hereof. None of the proceeds will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin security or for the purposes of reducing or retiring any indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any margin security or for any other purpose which might cause any of the Loans to be considered a "purpose credit" within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.7 <U>Appointment of Parent as Lead Borrower for Requesting Loans and Receipts of Loans and Statements</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes Lead Borrower to request and receive Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations pursuant to this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements from Agent or any Lender in the name or on behalf of such Borrower, to select the applicable Interest Rate for any such Loans or to take other actions contemplated as being taken by any Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements. Agent and Lenders may disburse the Loans to such bank account of Lead Borrower or a Borrower or otherwise make such Loans to a Borrower and provide such Letter of Credit Accommodations to a Borrower as Lead Borrower may designate or direct, without notice to any other Borrower or Obligor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Agent and Lead Borrower may at any time and from time to time require that Loans to or for the account of any Borrower be disbursed directly to an operating account of such Borrower.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Lead Borrower hereby accepts the appointment by Borrowers to act for and on behalf of the other Borrowers pursuant to this Section 6.7.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Each other Borrower and Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes Lead Borrower to receive statements on account and all other notices from Agent and Lenders with respect to the Obligations or otherwise under or in connection with this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements and any statements or notices sent to or received by Lead Borrower shall be deemed received by each of the other Borrowers and Guarantors.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) Any notice, election, representation, warranty, agreement or undertaking by or on behalf of any other Borrower or any Guarantor by Lead Borrower shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made by such Borrower or Guarantor, as the case may be, and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Borrower or Guarantor to the same extent as if made directly by such Borrower of Guarantor.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (e) No purported termination of the appointment of Lead Borrower as agent as aforesaid shall be effective, except after ten (10) days' prior written notice to Agent.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.8 <U>Pro Rata Treatment</U>. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement: (a) the making and conversion of Loans shall be made among the Lenders based on their respective Pro Rata Shares as to the Loans and (b) each payment on account of any Obligations to or for the account of one or more of Lenders in respect of any Obligations due on a particular day shall be allocated among the Lenders entitled to such payments based on their respective Pro Rata Shares and shall be distributed accordingly.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.9 <U>Sharing of Payments, Etc</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Each Borrower and Guarantor agrees that, in addition to (and without limitation of) any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim Agent or any Lender may otherwise have, each Lender shall be entitled, at its option (but subject, as among Agent and Lenders, to the provisions of Section 12.3(b) hereof), to offset balances held by it for the account of such Borrower or Guarantor at any of its offices, in dollars or in any other currency, against any principal of or interest on any Loans owed to such Lender or any other amount payable to such Lender hereunder, that is not paid when due (regardless of whether such balances are then due to such Borrower or Guarantor), in which case it shall promptly notify Lead Borrower and Agent thereof; <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, such Lender's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) If any Lender (including Agent) shall obtain from any Borrower or Guarantor payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan owing to it or payment of any other amount under this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise (other than from Agent as provided herein), and, as a result of such payment, such Lender shall have received more than its Pro Rata Share of the principal of the Loans or more than its share of such other amounts then due hereunder or thereunder by any Borrower or Guarantor to such Lender than the percentage thereof received by any other Lender, it shall promptly pay to Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, the amount of such excess and simultaneously purchase from such other Lenders a participation<BR>

<P style='page-break-before:always'>
<BR>

in the Loans or such other amounts, respectively, owing to such other Lenders (or such interest due thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all Lenders shall share the benefit of such excess payment (net of any expenses that may be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such excess payment) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares or as otherwise agreed by Lenders. To such end all Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participation sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Each Borrower and Guarantor agrees that any Lender purchasing a participation (or direct interest) as provided in this Section may exercise, in a manner consistent with this Section, all rights of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans or other amounts (as the case may be) owing to such Lender in the amount of such participation.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaims or similar rights or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other Indebtedness or obligation of any Borrower or Guarantor. If, under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, assign such rights to Agent for the benefit of Lenders and, in any event, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of Lenders entitled under this Section to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.10 <U>Settlement Procedures</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) In order to administer the Credit Facility in an efficient manner and to minimize the transfer of funds between Agent and Lenders, Agent may, at its option, subject to the terms of this Section, make available, on behalf of Lenders, the full amount of the Loans requested or charged to any Borrower's loan account(s) or otherwise to be advanced by Lenders pursuant to the terms hereof, without requirement of prior notice to Lenders of the proposed Loans.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) With respect to all Loans made by Agent on behalf of Lenders as provided in this Section, the amount of each Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Loans shall be computed weekly, and shall be adjusted upward or downward on the basis of the amount of the outstanding Loans as of 5:00 p.m. Chicago time on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of each settlement computation; <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, Agent retains the absolute right at any time or from time to time to make the above described adjustments at intervals more frequent than weekly, but in no event more than twice in any week. Agent shall deliver to each of the Lenders after the end of each week, or at such lesser period or periods as Agent shall determine, a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Loans for such period (such week or lesser period or periods being hereinafter referred to as a "Settlement Period"). If the summary statement is sent by Agent and received by a Lender prior to 12:00 p.m. Chicago time, then such Lender shall make the settlement transfer described in this Section by no later than 3:00 p.m. Chicago time on the same Business Day and if received by a Lender after 12:00 p.m. Chicago<BR>
<BR>

<P style='page-break-before:always'>
<BR>

time, then such Lender shall make the settlement transfer by not later than 3:00 p.m. Chicago time on the next Business Day following the date of receipt. If, as of the end of any Settlement Period, the amount of a Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Loans is more than such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Loans as of the end of the previous Settlement Period, then such Lender shall forthwith (but in no event later than the time set forth in the preceding sentence) transfer to Agent by wire transfer in immediately available funds the amount of the increase. Alternatively, if the amount of a Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Loans in any Settlement Period is less than the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Loans for the previous Settlement Period, Agent shall forthwith transfer to such Lender by wire transfer in immediately available funds the amount of the decrease. The obligation of each of the Lenders to transfer such funds and effect such settlement shall be irrevocable and unconditional and without recourse to or warranty by Agent. Agent and each Lender agrees to mark its books and records at the end of each Settlement Period to show at all times the dollar amount of its Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations. Each Lender shall only be entitled to receive interest on its Pro Rata Share of the Loans to the extent such Loans have been funded by such Lender. Because the Agent on behalf of Lenders may be advancing and/or may be repaid Loans prior to the time when Lenders will actually advance and/or be repaid such Loans, interest with respect to Loans shall be allocated by Agent in accordance with the amount of Loans actually advanced by and repaid to each Lender and the Agent and shall accrue from and including the date such Loans are so advanced to but excluding the date such Loans are either repaid by Borrowers or actually settled with the applicable Lender as described in this Section.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) To the extent that Agent has made any such amounts available and the settlement described above shall not yet have occurred, upon repayment of any Loans by a Borrower, Agent may apply such amounts repaid directly to any amounts made available by Agent pursuant to this Section. In lieu of weekly or more frequent settlements, Agent may, at its option, at any time require each Lender to provide Agent with immediately available funds representing its Pro Rata Share of each Loan, prior to Agent's disbursement of such Loan to Borrower. In such event, all Loans under this Agreement shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to their Pro Rata Shares. No Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in the other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder nor shall the Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of the default by any other Lender in the other Lender's obligation to make a Loan hereunder.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) If Agent is not funding a particular Loan to or for the benefit of a Borrower pursuant to Sections 6.10(a) and 6.10(b) on any day, but is requiring each Lender to provide Agent with immediately available funds on the date of such Loan, Agent may assume that each Lender will make available to Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Loan requested or otherwise made on such day and Agent may, in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, cause a corresponding amount to be made available to or for the benefit of such Borrower on such day. If Agent makes such corresponding amount available to a Borrower and such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Agent by such Lender, Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon for each day from the date such payment was due until the date such amount is paid to Agent at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during such period (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or at Agent's option based on the arithmetic mean determined by Agent of the rates<BR>

for the last transaction in overnight Federal funds arranged prior to 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on that day by each of the three leading brokers of Federal funds transactions in New York City selected by Agent) and if such amounts are not paid within three (3) days of Agent's demand, at the highest Interest Rate provided for in Section 3.1 hereof applicable to Prime Rate Loans. During the period in which such Lender has not paid such corresponding amount to Agent, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements, the amount so advanced by Agent to or for the benefit of any Borrower shall, for all purposes hereof, be a Loan made by Agent for its own account. Upon any such failure by a Lender to pay Agent, Agent shall promptly thereafter notify Lead Borrower of such failure and Borrowers shall pay such corresponding amount to Agent for its own account within five (5) Business Days of Lead Borrower's receipt of such notice. A Lender who fails to pay Agent its Pro Rata Share of any Loans made available by the Agent on such Lender's behalf, or any Lender who fails to pay any other amount owing by it to Agent, is a "Defaulting Lender". Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments received by Agent for the Defaulting Lender's benefit, nor shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to the sharing of any payments hereunder (including any principal, interest or fees). Amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender shall instead be paid to or retained by Agent. Agent may hold and, in its discretion, relend to a Borrower the amount of all such payments received or retained by it for the account of such Defaulting Lender. For purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements and determining Pro Rata Shares, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" and such Lender's Commitment shall be deemed to be zero (0). This Section shall remain effective with respect to a Defaulting Lender until such default is cured. The operation of this Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, or relieve or excuse the performance by any Borrower or Obligor of their duties and obligations hereunder.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (e) Lead Borrower and Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, at any time that there is a Defaulting Lender, and upon the exercise by either Lead Borrower or Agent of such right, such Defaulting Lender shall have the obligation, to sell, assign and transfer to an Eligible Transferee designated by Lead Borrower and approved by Agent or designated by Agent, the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender and all rights and interests of such Defaulting Lender pursuant thereto. Lead Borrower or Agent, as the case may be, shall provide the Defaulting Lender (and the Lead Borrower or the Agent as the case may be) with prior written notice of its intent to exercise its right under this Section, which notice shall specify the date on which such purchase and sale shall occur. Such purchase and sale shall be pursuant to the terms of an Assignment and Acceptance (whether or not executed by the Defaulting Lender), except that on the date of such purchase and sale, the Eligible Transferee specified by Lead Borrower and approved by Agent or Agent, shall pay to the Defaulting Lender (except as Agent and such Defaulting Lender may otherwise agree) the amount equal to: (i) the principal balance of the Loans held by the Defaulting Lender outstanding as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the effective date of such purchase and sale, plus (ii) amounts accrued and unpaid in respect of interest and fees payable to the Defaulting Lender to the effective date of the purchase (but in no event shall the Defaulting Lender be deemed entitled to any early termination fee), minus (iii) the amount of the closing fee received by the Defaulting Lender pursuant to the terms hereof or of any of the other Financing Agreements multiplied by the fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months remaining in the then current term of the Credit Facility and the denominator of which is the number of months in the then current<BR>

term thereof. Such purchase and sale shall be effective on the date of the payment of such amount to the Defaulting Lender and the Commitment of the Defaulting Lender shall terminate on such date.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (f) Nothing in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Financing Agreements shall be deemed to require Agent to advance funds on behalf of any Lender or to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment hereunder or to prejudice any rights that any Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by any Lender hereunder in fulfilling its Commitment.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.11 <U>Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders' Rights</U>. The obligation of each Lender hereunder is several, and no Lender shall be responsible for the obligation or commitment of any other Lender hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements and no action taken by the Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders to be a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and independent debt, and subject to Section 12.3 hereof, each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and it shall not be necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.</P>

The Borrowing Base may be adjusted based on the information set forth in the reports received by Agent under Section 7.1(a)(i) above. If any Borrower's or Guarantor's records or reports of the Collateral are prepared or maintained by an accounting service, contractor, shipper or other agent, such Borrower and Guarantor hereby irrevocably authorizes such service, contractor, shipper or agent to deliver such records, reports, and related documents to Agent and to follow Agent's instructions with respect to further services at any time that an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing.</P>

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Agent may, in its discretion, at such time or times (i) notify any or all Account Debtors, secondary obligors or other obligors in respect thereof that the Receivables have been assigned to Agent and that Agent has a security interest therein and Agent may direct any or all accounts debtors, secondary obligors and other obligors to make payment of Receivables directly to Agent, (ii) extend the time of payment of, compromise, settle or adjust for cash, credit, return of merchandise or otherwise, and upon any terms or conditions, any and all Receivables or other obligations included in the Collateral and thereby discharge or release the Account Debtor or any secondary obligors or other obligors in respect thereof without affecting any of the Obligations, (iii) demand, collect or enforce payment of any Receivables or such other obligations, but without any duty to do so, and Agent and Lenders shall not be liable for any failure to collect or enforce the payment thereof nor for the negligence of its agents or attorneys with respect thereto and (iv) take whatever other action Agent may deem necessary or desirable for the protection of its interests and the interests of Lenders. At any time that an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, at Agent's request, all invoices and statements sent to any Account Debtor shall state that the Accounts and such other obligations have been assigned to Agent and are payable directly and only to Agent and Borrowers and Obligors shall deliver to Agent such originals of documents evidencing the sale and delivery of goods or the performance of services giving rise to any Accounts as Agent may require. In the event any Account Debtor returns Inventory when an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, Borrowers shall, upon Agent's request, hold the returned Inventory in trust for Agent, segregate all returned Inventory from all of its other property, dispose of the returned Inventory solely according to Agent's instructions, and not issue any credits, discounts or allowances with respect thereto without Agent's prior written consent.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (e) To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on Agent or any Lender to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner (which duties cannot be waived under such law), each Borrower and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for Agent or any Lender (i) to fail to incur expenses reasonably deemed significant by Agent or any Lender to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to complete raw material or work in process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (ii) to fail to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to obtain consents of any Governmental Authority or other third party for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (iii) to fail to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors, secondary obligors or other persons obligated on Collateral or to remove liens or encumbrances on or any adverse claims against Collateral, (iv) to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors and other persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (v) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (vi) to contact other persons, whether or not in the same business as any Borrower or Guarantor, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of the Collateral, (vii) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral, whether or not the collateral is of a specialized nature, (viii) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing Internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capability of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (ix) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets, (x) to<BR>

disclaim disposition warranties, (xi) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure Agent or Lenders against risks of loss, collection or disposition of Collateral or to provide to Agent or Lenders a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (xii) to the extent deemed appropriate by Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral. Each Borrower and Guarantor acknowledges that the purpose of this Section is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by Agent or any Lender would not be commercially unreasonable in the exercise by Agent or any Lender of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by Agent or any Lender shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to grant any rights to any Borrower or Guarantor or to impose any duties on Agent or Lenders that would not have been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by applicable law in the absence of this Section.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (f) For the purpose of enabling Agent to exercise the rights and remedies hereunder, each Borrower and Obligor hereby grants to Agent, to the extent assignable, an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable at any time an Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and for so long as the same is continuing) without payment of royalty or other compensation to any Borrower or Obligor, to use, assign, license or sublicense any of the trademarks, service-marks, trade names, business names, trade styles, designs, logos and other source of business identifiers and other Intellectual Property and general intangibles now owned or hereafter acquired by any Borrower or Obligor, wherever the same maybe located, including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used for the compilation or printout thereof.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (g) At any time an Event of Default shall exist or have occurred and for so long as the same is continuing, Agent may apply the cash proceeds of Collateral actually received by Agent from any sale, lease, foreclosure or other disposition of the Collateral to payment of the Obligations, in whole or in part and in accordance with the terms hereof, whether or not then due. Borrowers and Guarantors shall remain liable to Agent and Lenders for the payment of any deficiency with interest at the highest rate provided for herein and all costs and expenses of collection or enforcement, including attorneys' fees and expenses.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (h) Without limiting the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, (i) Agent and Lenders may, at Agent's option, and upon the occurrence of an Event of Default at the direction of the Required Lenders, Agent and Lenders shall, without notice, (A) cease making Loans or arranging for Letter of Credit Accommodations or reduce the lending formulas or amounts of Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations available to Borrowers and/or (B) terminate any provision of this Agreement providing for any future Loans or Letter of Credit Accommodations to be made by Agent and Lenders to Borrowers and (ii) Agent may, at its option, establish such Reserves as Agent determines, without limitation or restriction, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Each Borrower and Guarantor hereby waives personal service of any and all process upon it and consents that all such service of process may be made by certified mail (return receipt requested) directed to its address set forth herein and service so made shall be deemed to be completed five (5) days after the same shall have been so deposited in the U.S. mails, or, at Agent's option, by service upon any Borrower or Guarantor in any other manner provided under the rules of any such courts. Within thirty (30) days after such service, such Borrower or Guarantor shall appear in answer to such process, failing which such Borrower or Guarantor shall be deemed in default and judgment may be entered by Agent against such Borrower or Guarantor for the amount of the claim and other relief requested.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) BORROWERS, GUARANTORS, AGENT AND LENDERS EACH HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER FINANCING AGREEMENTS OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER FINANCING AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE.

WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT ANY BORROWER, ANY GUARANTOR, AGENT OR ANY LENDER MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (e) Agent and Lenders shall not have any liability to any Borrower or Guarantor (whether in tort, contract, equity or otherwise) for losses suffered by such Borrower or Guarantor in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the transactions or relationships contemplated by this Agreement, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection herewith, except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or a Lender as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment or court order binding on Agent and such Lender. In any such litigation, Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to the benefit of the rebuttable presumption that it acted in good faith and with the exercise of ordinary care in the performance by it of the terms of this Agreement. Each Borrower and Guarantor: (i) certifies that neither Agent, any Lender nor any representative, agent or attorney acting for or on behalf of Agent or any Lender has represented, expressly or otherwise, that Agent and Lenders would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce any of the waivers provided for in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements and (ii) acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements, Agent and Lenders are relying upon, among other things, the waivers and certifications set forth in this Section 11.1 and elsewhere herein and therein.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.2 <U>Waiver of Notices</U>. Each Borrower and Guarantor hereby expressly waives demand, presentment, protest and notice of protest and notice of dishonor with respect to any and all instruments and chattel paper, included in or evidencing any of the Obligations or the Collateral, and any and all other demands and notices of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, the Collateral and this Agreement, except such as are expressly provided for herein. No notice to or demand on any Borrower or Guarantor which Agent or any Lender may elect to give shall entitle such Borrower or Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand to which such Borrower or Guarantor is not otherwise entitled in the same, similar or other circumstances.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.3 <U>Amendments and Waivers</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Neither this Agreement nor any other Financing Agreement nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated unless such amendment, waiver, discharge or termination is in writing signed by Agent and the Required Lenders or at Agent's option, by Agent with the authorization of the Required Lenders, and as to amendments to any of the Financing Agreements (other than with respect to any provision of Section 12 hereof), by Lead Borrower (for itself and the other Borrowers); <U>except</U>, <U>that</U>, no such amendment, waiver, discharge or termination shall:</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) reduce the interest rate or any fees or extend the time of payment of principal, interest or any fees or reduce the principal amount of any Loan or Letter of Credit Accommodations, in each case without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii) release any Collateral (except as expressly required hereunder or under any of the other Financing Agreements or applicable law and except as permitted under Section 12.11(b) hereof), without the consent of Agent and all of Lenders,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iv) reduce any percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders, without the consent of Agent and all of Lenders,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (v) consent to the assignment or transfer by any Borrower or Guarantor of any of their rights and obligations under this Agreement, without the consent of Agent and all of Lenders,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (vi) amend, modify or waive any terms of this Section 11.3 hereof, without the consent of Agent and all of Lenders, or</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (vii) increase the advance rates constituting part of the Borrowing Base, without the consent of Agent and all of Lenders.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Agent and Lenders shall not, by any act, delay, omission or otherwise be deemed to have expressly or impliedly waived any of its or their rights, powers and/or remedies unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed as provided herein. Any such waiver shall be enforceable only to the extent specifically set forth therein. A waiver by Agent or any Lender of any right, power and/or remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any such right, power and/or remedy which Agent or any Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion, whether similar in kind or otherwise.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 11.3(a) above, in connection with any amendment, waiver, discharge or termination, in the event that any Lender whose consent thereto is required shall fail to consent or fail to consent in a timely manner (such Lender being referred to herein as a "Non-Consenting Lender"), but the consent of any other Lenders to such amendment, waiver, discharge or termination that is required are obtained, if any, then Congress and Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, at any time thereafter, and upon the exercise by Congress or Parent of such right, such Non-Consenting Lender shall have the obligation, to sell, assign and transfer to Congress or such Eligible Transferee as Congress may specify, the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender and all rights and interests of such Non-Consenting Lender pursuant thereto. Congress or Parent shall provide the Non-Consenting Lender with prior written notice of its intent to exercise its right under this Section, which notice shall specify on date on which such purchase and sale shall occur. Such purchase and sale shall be pursuant to the terms of an Assignment and Acceptance (whether or not executed by the Non-Consenting Lender), except that on the date of such purchase and sale, Congress, or such Eligible Transferee specified by Congress, shall pay to the Non-Consenting Lender (except as Congress and such Non-Consenting Lender may otherwise agree) the amount equal to: (i) the principal balance of the Loans held by the Non-Consenting Lender outstanding as of the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the<BR>

<BR>

effective date of such purchase and sale, plus (ii) amounts accrued and unpaid in respect of interest and fees payable to the Non-Consenting Lender to the effective date of the purchase (but in no event shall the Non-Consenting Lender be deemed entitled to any early termination fee), minus (iii) the amount of the closing fee received by the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to the terms hereof or of any of the other Financing Agreements multiplied by the fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months remaining in the then current term of the Credit Facility and the denominator of which is the number of months in the then current term thereof. Such purchase and sale shall be effective on the date of the payment of such amount to the Non-Consenting Lender and the Commitment of the Non-Consenting Lender shall terminate on such date.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) The consent of Agent shall be required for any amendment, waiver or consent affecting the rights or duties of Agent hereunder or under any of the other Financing Agreements, in addition to the consent of the Lenders otherwise required by this Section and the exercise by Agent of any of its rights hereunder with respect to Reserves or Eligible Accounts, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Credit Card Receivables, Eligible Equipment, Eligible Prescription Files or Eligible Real Property shall not be deemed an amendment to the advance rates provided for in this Section 11.3.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.4 <U>Waiver of Counterclaims</U>. Each Borrower and Guarantor waives all rights to interpose any claims, deductions, setoffs or counterclaims of any nature (other then compulsory counterclaims) in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, the Obligations, the Collateral or any matter arising therefrom or relating hereto or thereto.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.5 <U>Indemnification</U>. Each Borrower and Guarantor shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold Agent and each Lender, and its officers, directors, agents, employees, advisors and counsel and their respective Affiliates (each such person being an "Indemnitee"), harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any of them in connection with any litigation, investigation, claim or proceeding commenced or threatened related to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of this Agreement, any other Financing Agreements, or any undertaking or proceeding related to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any act, omission, event or transaction related or attendant thereto, including amounts paid in settlement, court costs, and the fees and expenses of counsel except that Borrowers and Guarantors shall not have any obligation under this Section 11.5 to indemnify an Indemnitee with respect to a matter covered hereby to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined pursuant to a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction (but without limiting the obligations of Borrowers or Guarantors as to any other Indemnitee). To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in this Section may be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrowers and Guarantors shall pay the maximum portion which it is permitted to pay under applicable law to Agent and Lenders in satisfaction of indemnified matters under this Section. To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower or Guarantor shall assert, and each Borrower and Guarantor hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any of the other Financing Agreements or any undertaking or<BR>

transaction contemplated hereby. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable upon demand. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the payment of the Obligations and the termination or non-renewal of this Agreement.</P>
<P><B>SECTION 12 <U>THE AGENT</U></B></P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.1 <U>Appointment, Powers and Immunities</U>. Each Lender irrevocably designates, appoints and authorizes Congress to act as Agent hereunder and under the other Financing Agreements with such powers as are specifically delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement and of the other Financing Agreements, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Agent (a) shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and in the other Financing Agreements, and shall not by reason of this Agreement or any other Financing Agreement be a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender; (b) shall not be responsible to Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Agreements, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement or any other Financing Agreement, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Financing Agreement or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by any Borrower or any Obligor or any other Person to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder; and (c) shall not be responsible to Lenders for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other Financing Agreement or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any of the other rights and duties of Agent provided for herein or in the other Financing Agreements, each Lender hereby specifically irrevocably authorizes and directs Agent to enter into the Supplemental Loan Intercreditor Agreement on behalf of such Lender and acknowledges and agrees that such Lender shall be bound thereby and subject to all of the terms and conditions thereof, deemed to make all representations and warranties made by a Revolving Loan Lender (as such term is defined therein) as to itself and Agent shall be irrevocably authorized to take such actions as are provided for on behalf of such Lender thereunder. Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in good faith. Agent may deem and treat the payee of any note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until the assignment thereof pursuant to an agreement (if and to the extent permitted herein) in form and substance satisfactory to Agent shall have been delivered to and acknowledged by Agent.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.2 <U>Reliance by Agent</U>. Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Financing Agreement, Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or thereunder in accordance with instructions given by the Required Lenders or all of Lenders as is required in such circumstance, and such<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P style='page-break-before:always'>
<BR>

instructions of such Agents and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all Lenders.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.3 <U>Events of Default</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default or other failure of a condition precedent to the Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations hereunder, unless and until Agent has received written notice from a Lender, or a Borrower specifying such Event of Default or any unfulfilled condition precedent, and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default or Failure of Condition". In the event that Agent receives such a Notice of Default or Failure of Condition, Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. Agent shall (subject to Section 12.7) take such action with respect to any such Event of Default or failure of condition precedent as shall be directed by the Required Lenders; <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, unless and until Agent shall have received such directions, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to or by reason of such Event of Default or failure of condition precedent, as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding the existence or occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or any other failure to satisfy any of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement to the contrary, Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, continue to make Loans and issue or cause to be issued Letter of Credit Accommodations for the ratable account and risk of Lenders from time to time if Agent believes making such Loans or issuing or causing to be issued such Letter of Credit Accommodations is in the best interests of Lenders.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Except with the prior written consent of Agent, no Lender may assert or exercise any enforcement right or remedy in respect of the Loans, Letter of Credit Accommodations or other Obligations, as against any Borrower or Obligor or any of the Collateral or other property of any Borrower or Obligor.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.4 <U>Congress in its Individual Capacity</U>. With respect to its Commitment and the Loans made and Letter of Credit Accommodations issued or caused to be issued by it (and any successor acting as Agent), so long as Congress shall be a Lender hereunder, it shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include Congress in its individual capacity as Lender hereunder. Congress (and any successor acting as Agent) and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Lender) lend money to, make investments in and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrowers (and any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) as if it were not acting as Agent, and Congress and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from any Borrower or Guarantor and any of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.5 <U>Indemnification</U>. Lenders agree to indemnify Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrowers hereunder and without limiting any obligations of Borrowers hereunder) ratably, in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, for any and all claims of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent (including by any Lender) arising out of or by reason of any investigation in or in any way relating to or arising out of this<BR>

Agreement or any other Financing Agreement or any other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the costs and expenses that Agent is obligated to pay hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents, <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent it arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the payment of the Obligations and the termination or non-renewal of this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.6 <U>Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders</U>. Each Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on Agent or other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of Borrowers and Obligors and has made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements. Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by any Borrower or Obligor of any term or provision of this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of any Borrower or Obligor. Agent will use reasonable efforts to provide Lenders with any information received by Agent from any Borrower or Obligor which is required to be provided to Lenders or deemed to be requested by Lenders hereunder and with a copy of any Notice of Default or Failure of Condition received by Agent from any Borrower or any Lender; <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, Agent shall not be liable to any Lender for any failure to do so, except to the extent that such failure is attributable to Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to Lenders by Agent hereunder, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any other credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of any Borrower or Obligor that may come into the possession of Agent.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.7 <U>Failure to Act</U>. Except for action expressly required of Agent hereunder and under the other Financing Agreements, Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction from Lenders of their indemnification obligations under Section 12.5 hereof against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.8 <U>Additional Loans</U>. Agent shall not make any Loans or provide any Letter of Credit Accommodations to any Borrower on behalf of Lenders intentionally and with actual knowledge that such Loans or Letter of Credit Accommodations would cause the aggregate amount of the total outstanding Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations to such Borrower to exceed the Borrowing Base of such Borrower, without the prior consent of all Lenders, <U>except</U>, <U>that</U>, Agent may make such additional Loans or provide such additional Letter of Credit Accommodations on behalf of Lenders, intentionally and with actual knowledge that such Loans or Letter of Credit Accommodations will cause the total outstanding Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations to such Borrower to exceed the Borrowing Base of such Borrower, as Agent may deem necessary<BR>

Each Lender shall be obligated to pay Agent the amount of its Pro Rata Share of any such additional Loans or Letter of Credit Accommodations.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.9 <U>Concerning the Collateral and the Related Financing Agreements</U>. Each Lender authorizes and directs Agent to enter into this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements. Each Lender agrees that any action taken by Agent or Required Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Financing Agreements and the exercise by Agent or Required Lenders of their respective powers set forth therein or herein, together with such other powers that are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.10 <U>Field Audit, Examination Reports and other Information; Disclaimer by Lenders</U>. By signing this Agreement, each Lender:</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) is deemed to have requested that Agent furnish such Lender, promptly after it becomes available, a copy of each field audit or examination report and report with respect to the Borrowing Base prepared or received by Agent (each field audit or examination report and report with respect to the Borrowing Base being referred to herein as a "Report" and collectively, "Reports"), appraisal and financial statements;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) expressly agrees and acknowledges that Agent (i) does not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Report, appraisal or financial statement or (ii) shall not be liable for any information contained in any Report, appraisal or financial statement;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not comprehensive audits or examinations, that Agent or any other party performing any audit or examination will inspect only specific information regarding Borrowers and Guarantors and will rely significantly upon Borrowers' and Guarantors' books and records, as well as on representations of Borrowers' and Guarantors' personnel; and</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) agrees to keep all Reports confidential and strictly for its internal use in accordance with the terms of Section 13.5 hereof, and not to distribute or use any Report in any other manner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Agent may, at its option, from time to time, at any time on or after an Event of Default and for so long as the same is continuing or upon any other failure of a condition precedent to the Loans and Letter of Credit Accommodations hereunder, make such<BR>

Special Agent Advances shall be repayable on demand and together with all interest thereon shall constitute Obligations secured by the Collateral. Special Agent Advances shall not constitute Loans but shall otherwise constitute Obligations hereunder. Interest on Special Agent Advances shall be payable at the Interest Rate then applicable to Prime Rate Loans and shall be payable on demand. Without limitation of its obligations pursuant to Section 6.10, each Lender agrees that it shall make available to Agent, upon Agent's demand, in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each such Special Agent Advance. If such funds are not made available to Agent by such Lender, such Lender shall be deemed a Defaulting Lender and Agent shall be entitled to recover such funds, on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon for each day from the date such payment was due until the date such amount is paid to Agent at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during such period (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or at Agent's option based on the arithmetic mean determined by Agent of the rates for the last transaction in overnight Federal funds arranged prior to 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on that day by each of the three leading brokers of Federal funds transactions in New York City selected by Agent) and if such amounts are not paid within three (3) days of Agent's demand, at the highest Interest Rate provided for in Section 3.1 hereof applicable to Prime Rate Loans.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option and in its discretion to release any security interest in, mortgage or lien upon, any of the Collateral (i) upon termination of the Commitments and payment and satisfaction of all of the Obligations and delivery of cash collateral to the extent required under Section 13.1 below, or (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if Lead Borrower or any Borrower or Guarantor certifies to Agent that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with Section 9.7 hereof (and Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry), or (iii) constituting property in which any Borrower or Guarantor did not own an interest at the time the security interest, mortgage or lien was granted or at any time thereafter, or (iv) having a value in the aggregate in any twelve (12) month period of less than $5,000,000, and to the extent Agent may release its security interest in and lien upon any such Collateral pursuant to the sale or other disposition thereof, such sale or other disposition shall be deemed consented to by Lenders, or (v) if required or permitted under any other terms hereof or of any of the other Financing Agreements, including any intercreditor agreement, or (vi) approved, authorized or ratified in writing by all of Lenders. Except as provided above, Agent will not release any security interest in, mortgage or lien upon, any of the Collateral without the prior written authorization of all of Lenders. Upon request by Agent at any time, Lenders will promptly confirm in writing Agent's authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Without in any manner limiting Agent's authority to act without any specific or further authorization or consent by the Required Lenders, each Lender agrees to confirm in writing, upon request by Agent, the authority to release Collateral conferred upon Agent under this Section. Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the security interest, mortgage or liens granted to Agent upon any Collateral to the extent set forth above; <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, (i) Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in Agent's opinion, would expose Agent to liability or create any obligations or entail any consequence other than the release of such security interest, mortgage or liens without recourse or warranty and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any security interest, mortgage or lien upon (or obligations of any Borrower or Guarantor in respect of) the Collateral retained by such Borrower or Guarantor.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender or any other Person to investigate, confirm or assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Borrower or Guarantor or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered, or that any particular items of Collateral meet the eligibility criteria applicable in respect of the Loans or Letter of Credit Accommodations hereunder, or whether any particular reserves are appropriate, or that the liens and security interests granted to Agent pursuant hereto or any of the Financing Agreements or otherwise have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Agent in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Agreements, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related thereto, Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its discretion, given Agent's own interest in the Collateral as a Lender and that Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to any other Lender.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.12 <U>Agency for Perfection</U>. Each Lender hereby appoints Agent and each other Lender as agent and bailee for the purpose of perfecting the security interests in and liens upon the Collateral of Agent in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC can be perfected only by possession (or where the security interest of a secured party with possession has priority over the security interest of another secured party) and Agent and each Lender hereby acknowledges that it holds possession of any such Collateral for the benefit of Agent as secured party. Should any Lender obtain possession of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Agent's request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to Agent or in accordance with Agent's instructions.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.13 <U>Successor Agent</U>. Agent may resign as Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to Lenders and Parent. If Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for Lenders. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Agent, Agent may appoint, after consulting with Lenders and Parent, a successor agent from among Lenders. Upon the acceptance by the Lender so selected of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all of the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" as used herein and in the other Financing Agreements shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's<BR>

If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days after the date of a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nonetheless thereupon become effective and Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.14 <U>Co-Agent</U>. Agent may at any time and from time to time determine that a Lender may, in addition, be a "Co-Agent", "Co-Documentation Agent" or similar designation hereunder and enter into an agreement with such Lender to have it so identified for purposes of this Agreement. Agent shall provide written notice to Lead Borrower of any such agreement. Any Lender that is so designated as a Co-Agent, Co-Documentation Agent or such similar designation by Agent shall have no right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, the Lenders so identified shall not have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender and no Lender shall be deemed to have relied, nor shall any Lender rely, on a Lender so identified as a Co-Agent, Co-Documentation Agent or such similar designation in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.</P>

<P><B>SECTION 13 <U>TERM OF AGREEMENT; MISCELLANEOUS</U></B></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13.1 <U>Term</U>. </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER FINANCING AGREEMENTS SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE AS OF THE DATE SET FORTH ON THE FIRST PAGE HEREOF AND SHALL CONTINUE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT FOR A TERM ENDING ON THE DATE FOUR (4) YEARS FROM THE DATE HEREOF (THE "RENEWAL DATE"), AND FROM YEAR TO YEAR THEREAFTER, UNLESS SOONER TERMINATED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS HEREOF. AGENT MAY, AT ITS OPTION (OR SHALL AT THE DIRECTION OF ANY LENDER IN WRITING RECEIVED BY AGENT AT LEAST NINETY (90) DAYS PRIOR TO THE RENEWAL DATE OR ANY ANNIVERSARY OF THE RENEWAL DATE, AS THE CASE MAY BE), TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER FINANCING AGREEMENTS, OR LEAD BORROWER OR ANY BORROWER MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER FINANCING AGREEMENTS, EACH CASE, EFFECTIVE ON THE RENEWAL DATE OR ON ANY ANNIVERSARY OF THE RENEWAL DATE IN ANY YEAR BY GIVING TO THE OTHER PARTY AT LEAST SIXTY (60) DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE; <U>PROVIDED</U>, <U>THAT</U>, THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL OTHER FINANCING AGREEMENTS MUST BE TERMINATED SIMULTANEOUSLY. In addition, Borrowers may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable) and Agent may, at its option, and shall at the direction of Required Lenders, terminate this Agreement at any time on or after an Event of Default. Upon the Renewal Date or any other effective date of termination of the Financing Agreements, Borrowers shall pay to Agent all outstanding and unpaid Obligations and shall furnish cash collateral to Agent (or at Agent's option, a letter of credit issued for the account of Borrowers and at Borrowers' expense, in form<BR>

The amount of such cash collateral (or letter of credit, as Agent may determine) as to any Letter of Credit Accommodations shall be in the amount equal to one hundred five (105%) percent of the amount of the Letter of Credit Accommodations plus the amount of any expenses payable or to become payable in connection therewith through the end of the latest expiration date of such Letter of Credit Accommodations. Such payments in respect of the Obligations and cash collateral shall be remitted by wire transfer in Federal funds to the Agent Payment Account or such other bank account of Agent, as Agent may, in its discretion, designate in writing to Lead Borrower for such purpose. Interest shall be due until and including the next Business Day, if the amounts so paid by Borrowers to the Agent Payment Account or other bank account designated by Agent are received in such bank account later than 12:00 noon, Chicago time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) No termination of this Agreement or the other Financing Agreements shall relieve or discharge any Borrower or Guarantor of its respective duties, obligations and covenants under this Agreement or the other Financing Agreements until all Obligations have been fully and finally discharged and paid, and Agent's continuing security interest in the Collateral and the rights and remedies of Agent and Lenders hereunder, under the other Financing Agreements and applicable law, shall remain in effect until all such Obligations have been fully and finally discharged and paid. Accordingly, each Borrower and Guarantor waives any rights it may have under the UCC to demand the filing of termination statements with respect to the Collateral and Agent shall not be required to send such termination statements to Borrowers or Guarantors, or to file them with any filing office, in each case, unless and until this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms and all Obligations paid and satisfied in full in immediately available funds.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) If for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Renewal Date, in view of the impracticality and extreme difficulty of ascertaining actual damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of Agent's and each Lender's lost profits as a result thereof, Borrowers agree to pay to Agent for itself and the ratable benefit of Lenders, upon the effective date of such termination, an early termination fee in the amount equal to</P>

<P>Such early termination fee shall be presumed to be the amount of damages sustained by Agent and Lenders as a result of such early termination and Borrowers and Guarantors agree that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing. In addition, Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to such early termination fee upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Sections 10.1(f) and 10.1(g) hereof, even if Agent and Lenders do not exercise the right to terminate this Agreement, but elect, at their option, to provide financing to any Borrower or permit the use of cash collateral under the United States Bankruptcy Code.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>Employee Benefits</U></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Spartan Stores, Inc. Cash Balance Pension Plan has not received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Richard Deming v. Spartan Stores, Inc., et al. (Western District of Michigan, (Case No.: 1:03-CV-0449). Mr. Deming, a former executive-level employee, claims that his application for long term disability benefits was improperly denied. Spartan Stores, Inc.'s employee welfare benefit plan contracted with Jefferson Pilot Insurance Co. to provide long term disability benefits, and the insurer concluded that Deming did not meet the policy's definition of a disability.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As previously disclosed in Parent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the current value of the assets of the Spartan Stores, Inc. Cash Balance Pension Plan are less than the benefit of obligations of such Plan.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Borrowers may incur withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer pension plan on account of the closing and/or sale of certain Seaway Food Town stores, the amount of which, if any, has not yet been determined but is currently estimated to be $350,000 - $400,000.</P>
