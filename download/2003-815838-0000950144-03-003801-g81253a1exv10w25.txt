      Section 2.05. Milestone Payments. Purchaser shall pay and deliver to

(collectively, the "Milestone Payments"), upon the achievement of certain

Product (the "Milestones"), as follows:

            (a) Purchaser shall pay and deliver to Seller US$25,000,000 in
immediately available funds within 45 days after the last day of the first
calendar quarter during which the Annual Net Sales of the Product become equal
to or greater than US$25,000,000;

            (b) Purchaser shall pay and deliver to Seller US$25,000,000 in

            (c) Purchaser shall pay and deliver to Seller US$25,000,000 in
immediately available funds within 45 days of the last day of the first calendar
quarter during which the Annual Net Sales of the Product become equal to or

provided, that if more than one Milestone shall be achieved in any single
calendar quarter, each Milestone Payment corresponding to the achievement of
such Milestones shall be paid and delivered to Seller within 45 days of the last
day of such quarter in accordance with this Section 2.05.

      Section 2.06. Limited Right of Set-Off. Purchaser and Guarantor hereby
covenant and agree that except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section
2.06, each payment of the Transaction Consideration provided for in this Article
II shall be paid and delivered to Seller when due and payable in accordance with
the provisions of this Article II, and neither Purchaser nor Guarantor shall
have any right to set off against any amounts due or to become due to Seller
hereunder, any amounts that may become payable to Purchaser and/or Guarantor by
Seller pursuant to any provision of the Transaction Documents, any provision of
Applicable Law or otherwise; provided however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser may set off against any unpaid payment of the Transaction
Consideration due and payable to Seller hereunder any amounts due and payable to
Purchaser by Seller which amounts (a) are not subject to dispute between Seller
and Purchaser, or (b) have been determined to be due and payable pursuant to a
final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or a
final, nonappealable and binding arbitration award. ***.

      Section 2.07. Determination of Annual Net Sales.


            (a) Quarterly Reports. From the Closing until the payment in full of
the Milestone Payments, Purchaser shall provide financial reports to Seller on a

setting forth the amount of Annual Net Sales of the Product for the 12-month
period ending as of the end of each such calendar quarter. Seller and Purchaser
hereby acknowledge and agree that such reports shall constitute Confidential
Information for purposes of this Agreement and shall be held as confidential by
Seller in accordance with Section 8.01 hereof.

            (b) Generation of Annual Net Sales. Until the payment in full of the
Milestone Payments, Purchaser shall exercise reasonable commercial efforts to
maximize the Annual Net Sales of the Product, and ***.

            (c) Disputes. In the event Seller shall dispute the correctness of
Purchaser's calculation of Annual Net Sales for any 12-month period, Seller
shall, within 45 days of receipt of any such calculation, provide written notice
to Purchaser of such objection, setting forth in writing and in reasonable
detail the reasons therefor. Seller and Purchaser shall endeavor in good faith
to resolve any disputed matters within 45 days after Purchaser's receipt of
Seller's notice of objections. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve the
disputed matters within such 45-day period, Seller and Purchaser shall select a
nationally known independent accounting firm (which firm shall not be the then
regular auditors of Seller, Purchaser or Guarantor) to resolve the matters in
dispute, and the determination of such firm in respect of the correctness of
each matter remaining in dispute shall be conclusive and binding on Seller and
Purchaser. In connection with the resolution of any dispute under this Section
2.07(c), each party shall bear its own costs and expenses and share the costs
and expenses of any independent accounting firm selected to resolve such
disputes, except that if Purchaser is determined to have underreported the
amount of Annual Net Sales for the period subject to such dispute by ten percent
or more, or if any such understatement shall have resulted in Purchaser not
paying Seller a Milestone Payment to which Seller was entitled, then Purchaser
shall reimburse Seller for any and all reasonable, actual out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Seller in connection with the dispute, including any costs and
expenses payable to the independent accounting firm and any other costs and
expenses incurred by Seller in connection with such dispute resolution process.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.07(c), Seller's
failure to dispute the correctness of Purchaser's calculation of Annual Net
Sales for any 12-month period shall not prevent Seller from disputing the
calculation of Annual Net Sales for any calendar quarter of such undisputed
12-month period in connection with its dispute of any subsequent 12-month period
in accordance with this Section 2.07(c); provided however, that in the event
Seller shall dispute Purchaser's calculation of Annual Net Sales pursuant to
this Section 2.07(c), the final resolution of such dispute as to each of the
four calendar quarters of such 12-month period shall be binding upon Seller, and
shall not be further subject to dispute by Seller in connection with any
disputes as to future 12-month periods.

      Section 2.08. Assignment of Contracts and Rights; Cooperation. Anything in
the Transaction Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this
Agreement or in any of the Transaction Documents shall constitute an agreement
to assign or otherwise sell, convey or transfer any Purchased Asset or any
claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, or to enter
into any other agreement or arrangement with respect thereto, if any such
attempted assignment, sale, conveyance, transfer, manufacture or supply, or
entering into any agreement or arrangement pursuant thereto would, without the
consent or approval of any Person (including any Governmental Authority),
constitute a breach of, or other contravention under, any Contract or in any way
adversely affect the rights of Seller or Purchaser thereunder. With respect to
any such Contract or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom, promptly after the date hereof, the parties hereto will use
reasonable commercial efforts (but without any payment of money by Seller,
Purchaser any of their respective Affiliates to any third party) to obtain the
written consent of the other parties to any such Contract for the


                                      -11-

          Confidential Materials omitted and filed separately with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission. Asterisks denote omissions.


assignment thereof to Purchaser, or written confirmation from such parties
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Seller and Purchaser confirming
that such consent is not required. If such consent is not obtained with respect
to any such Contract or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective
or would adversely affect the rights of Seller or Purchaser thereunder, the
parties will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Purchaser
would obtain the benefits thereunder in accordance with this Agreement,
including subcontracting or subleasing to Purchaser, subject to Applicable Law
and the terms of such Contract. In such case, Seller shall, until such time as
any required consents shall have been obtained, act as the agent of the
Purchaser in order to obtain for Purchaser the benefits of such Contract as
though the Contract had been assigned to the Purchaser. If Seller shall
thereafter obtain a required consent to a Contract retained by Seller pursuant
to this Section 2.08, such Contract shall thereupon be transferred to Purchaser
without need of further action by Seller or Purchaser or of further
documentation.

                                  ARTICLE III
                           PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS

      Section 3.01. Purchase and Sale of Purchased Assets. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Closing Date (or, as to subsections
(c), (d) and (e) of this Section 3.01, if Seller shall not have received
Regulatory Approval prior to the Closing Date, then as of the date contemplated
by Section 2.03), Seller shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and accept, all right, title and
interest in and to the Purchased Assets. The "Purchased Assets" shall consist of
the following items and no others:

            (a) to the extent assignable, (i) all of the contracts listed in
Schedule 3.01(a), and (ii) any and all contracts entered into by Seller with the

pursuant to Section 9.02(b)(i) (collectively, the "Contracts");

            (b) the domain name MethyPatch.com;

            (c) the Regulatory Application;

            (d) the Regulatory and Clinical Materials; and

            (e) the Trademark.

Notwithstanding that the Regulatory Application, including the Product IND and
the Product NDA, shall constitute a Purchased Asset under this Agreement,
Purchaser covenants and agrees that it will not make, have made, manufacture or
have manufactured any Product and will purchase all of its requirements of the
Product from Seller pursuant to the terms and conditions of the License
Agreement and the Toll Conversion and Supply Agreement, except as otherwise
expressly permitted by the terms of the Toll Conversion and Supply Agreement;
provided however, that Purchaser may manufacture or have manufactured the
Product to the extent the Toll Conversion and Supply Agreement is terminated but
the License Agreement remains in effect.

contained herein, and subject to the transfer of any of the rights, title and
interest in and to the assets transferred by Seller under any of the Transaction
Documents, the Purchased Assets shall not include, and Seller shall retain all
of its rights, title and interest in and to, all assets, properties or rights of

respect to the Product;

            (e) any refunds of Income Taxes or any prepaid Income Taxes arising

            (f) any assets of Seller and its Affiliates not held or owned by or
used exclusively in connection with the Business;

            (g) any assets used in the manufacture of the Product;

            (h) any licenses or permits relating to the manufacture of the

or any other Governmental Authority;

            (i) any rights or claims of Seller under any of the Transaction
Documents or the agreements and instruments delivered to Seller by Purchaser or
Guarantor pursuant to any of the Transaction Documents; or

            (j) any assets related to Excluded Liabilities.


                                   ARTICLE IV
                            ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES

expressly assuming pursuant to this Agreement; and

            (b) all liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates under the Contracts
arising on or after the Closing Date.

      Section 4.02. Excluded Liabilities. The "Excluded Liabilities" are all

Liabilities, it being agreed that Purchaser and Guarantor are not assuming any
liability of Seller other than the Assumed Liabilities. Without limiting the
foregoing, "Excluded Liabilities" include the following:

            (a) all liabilities and obligations for any Income Taxes arising
from or related to the Business and the Purchased Assets in respect of any
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or arising from
the payment to or receipt by Seller of the Transaction Consideration or any
portion thereof;

            (b) all liabilities and obligations, whether presently in existence

                                   ARTICLE V

Effect on Purchaser or the Business, as the case may be, Purchaser is and has

or otherwise), ordinances, regulations, judgments, orders, directives,
injunctions, writs, decrees, or awards of any Governmental Authority.

            (d) Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and

Sections 2.03(c) and 2.03(d), (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements
of any Antitrust Laws (including the HSR Act), and (iii) the actions, consents,
approvals, permits or filings expressly referred to in this Agreement.

            (e) No Violation. Neither the execution and delivery of the

of the terms, conditions or provisions of Purchaser's or Guarantor's certificate
of incorporation or other governing or charter document, or of any statute or
administrative regulation, or, to the best of their knowledge, of any order,
writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any court or governmental authority or
of any arbitration award or any agreement binding upon Purchaser or Guarantor or
their respective assets, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters set forth in
Section 5.01(d), to the best of their knowledge, contravene or conflict with, or
constitute a violation of, any provisions of any Applicable Law binding upon
Purchaser or Guarantor, or (iii) assuming compliance with the matters set forth
in Section 5.01(d), constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of, or to a loss of any benefit to
which Purchaser or Guarantor is entitled under any provision of any contract,
agreement or other instrument of any license, franchise, permit or similar
authorization held by Purchaser or Guarantor and which default would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, Guarantor or the Business.

unexpired, undischarged or unsatisfied written or oral contract, agreement,
indenture, mortgage, debenture, note or other instrument under the terms of

Documents may be prohibited, prevented or delayed and which in either case would

            (g) Litigation. There is no Proceeding pending or, to knowledge of
Purchaser or Guarantor, threatened against Purchaser or Guarantor or any of
their respective Affiliates before any court, arbitrator, administrative agency
or other tribunal which (i) could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect upon Purchaser or the Business, (ii) could reasonably be expected
to prevent Purchaser or Guarantor from executing any Transaction Document or
consummating the Contemplated Transactions, or (iii) could reasonably be
expected to prevent or interfere with Seller's ability to obtain the Regulatory
Approval.

            (h) Licenses and Permits. Subject to receipt of Regulatory Approval
of the Product and compliance with the requirements of any Antitrust Laws
(including the HSR Act), Purchaser has all licenses, franchises, permits and
other similar authorizations affecting, or relating in any way to, the Business
and the Product required by Applicable Law to be obtained by Purchaser to permit
Purchaser to conduct the Business in the manner contemplated by the Transaction
Documents and to market, promote, distribute, use, sell, or otherwise dispose of

with, have evaluated and have relied upon certain documents and information,
(including the Product IND and the Product NDA, each in its entirety) to assist
Purchaser and Guarantor in making an informed and intelligent decision with
respect to the execution of the Transaction Documents. Each of Purchaser and
Guarantor shall undertake prior to Closing such further investigation and
request such additional documents and information as each deems necessary. Each
of Purchaser and Guarantor acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or
warranty as to the prospects, financial or otherwise, of the Business or the
sale of the Product, and that any projections, estimates or forecasts of future
results or events provided by or on behalf of Seller are subject to uncertainty
and to the assumptions used in their preparation. Purchaser agrees that it shall
accept the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as they exist on the
Closing Date (or, if any of such Purchased Assets are transferred to Purchaser
after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 2.03, on the date of such transfer)
based on Purchaser's inspection, examination and determination with respect
thereto as to all matters, and without reliance upon any express or implied
representations or warranties of any nature, whether in writing, orally or
otherwise, made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except as expressly set
forth in the Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein shall in any way limit Purchaser's or Guarantor's ability to rely fully
on the representations, warranties and agreements of Seller expressly contained
in the Transaction Documents.

            (j) Financing. Each of Purchaser and Guarantor has available to it
cash, marketable securities or other investments or available sources of credit

conditions set forth in the Transaction Documents.

other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf
of Purchaser or Guarantor

who might be entitled to any fee or commission from Seller upon effectuation of
the Contemplated Transactions.

            (l)   Regulatory Approval. Purchaser and Guarantor acknowledge that
as of the date of this Agreement, no Regulatory Approval has been issued to
permit the marketing, promotion, sale, distribution, use or other disposal of
the Product by Purchaser, and further acknowledge the possibility that such
Regulatory Approval may not be issued prior to or after the Closing Date.

            (m)   Generic Drug Enforcement Act. Neither Purchaser, it Affiliates
nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or
consultants have been charged with or convicted under federal law for conduct
relating to the development or approval of, or otherwise relating to the
regulation of, any product under the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 or any
other relevant statute, law or regulation.

understood and agreed by Purchaser that, with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.02(o), a reasonable inquiry or investigation

expressly provided in the Toll Conversion and Supply Agreement) or Seller's
pricing policies or price lists or (ii) personnel records of Seller relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or records or
other information that in Seller's good faith opinion is sensitive or the
disclosure of which could subject any Seller to risk of liability.

replacement of existing insurance policies with substantially similar policies
upon expiration of existing policies, on and after the date of this Agreement
and until the Closing Date, Seller shall not take or fail to take any action if

assets that would constitute Purchased Assets (if owned, held or used by Seller
on the Closing Date), or the Business. Seller shall not have any obligation to
maintain the effectiveness of any such insurance policy after the Closing Date
or to make any monetary payment in connection with any such policy for any
period after the Closing Date.

as demonstrated by competent proof, (ii) is or becomes generally available to
the public other than through any act or omission of the Receiving Party in
breach of this Agreement, (iii) is acquired by the Receiving Party from a third

Regulatory Authorities to obtain Regulatory Approval for the Product or to
comply with the requirement of any Regulatory Authority, (ii) to disclose
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to respond to an inquiry of a
Regulatory Authority or Governmental Authority concerning the Product, or (iii)
to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in a judicial,

as much advance written notice as possible of the required disclosure, (B)
cooperates with the Disclosing Party in any attempt to prevent or limit the
disclosure, and (C) limits disclosure, if any, to the specific purpose at issue.

                  (i)   Purchaser shall be permitted to disclose to its

      Information relating to the Product as Purchaser shall reasonably
      determine to be necessary or useful in order to effectively market and
      distribute the Product;

                  (ii)  Seller shall be permitted to disclose such Confidential
      Information relating to the Product as Seller shall reasonably determine

          Confidential Materials omitted and filed separately with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission. Asterisks denote omissions.


                  (iii) Seller shall be permitted to disclose such Confidential
      Information relating to the Product as it shall reasonably determine to be
      necessary or useful in order to pursue or obtain any regulatory approvals
      in respect of any other transdermal drug delivery products;

                  (iv)  each of Seller and Purchaser shall be permitted to
      disclose to a Regulatory Authority such Confidential Information relating
      to the Product as it shall reasonably determine (but only after consulting
      with the other party to the extent practicable) to be necessary to comply
      with the provisions of Applicable Law; and

                  (v)   nothing in this Section 8.01 shall be interpreted to
      limit the ability of either Seller or Purchaser to disclose its own
      Confidential Information to the other party or any other Person on such
      terms and subject to such conditions as it deems advisable or appropriate;

provided, however, that in each such case any third party recipients of any
Confidential Information (other than a Regulatory Authority or other
Governmental Authority) undertake substantially the same confidentiality
obligation as the parties hereunder with respect to such Confidential
Information.

            (d)   The parties agree that, with effect from the date of this
Agreement, the terms of this Section 8.01 shall supersede and replace the
confidentiality obligations of the parties under the letter of intent between
Seller and Purchaser dated as of January 8, 2003, which agreement is hereby
terminated and of no further force or effect.

            (e)   Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be considered Confidential
Information of each party and shall be treated accordingly. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller may be required to
disclose some or all of the information included in this Agreement in order to
comply with its obligations under the Securities Laws, and hereby consents to
such disclosure to the extent deemed advisable or appropriate by counsel to
Seller (but only after consulting with Purchaser to the extent practicable).

            (f)   Each party specifically recognizes that any breach by it of
this Section 8.01 may cause irreparable injury to the other party and that
actual damages may be difficult to ascertain, and in any event, may be
inadequate. Accordingly (and without limiting the availability of legal or
equitable, including injunctive, remedies under any other provisions of this
Agreement), each party agrees that in the event of any such breach,
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.02 or Article XII hereof, the other
party shall be entitled to seek, by way of private litigation in the first
instance, injunctive relief and such other legal and equitable remedies as may
be available.

      Section 8.02. Press Releases. Prior to the Closing, no party shall issue
any publicity, news or press release or make any public statement, written or
oral, with respect to this Agreement, any of the Contemplated Transactions or to
the existence of an arrangement among the parties without the prior written
approval of the other parties or except as may be required by

Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange,
in which case no party shall issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without prior consultation with the other parties and without
complying with Applicable Law; provided, however, that each of Seller and
Purchaser hereby agree to the release by the other, on or after the date of this
Agreement, of a press release substantially in the forms attached hereto as
Attachment IX and Attachment X, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
provision of this Agreement shall relieve any of the parties of their respective
obligations under Section 8.01.

      Section 8.03. Additional Formulations and Improvements.

            (a)   ***.

            (b)   ***.

            (c)   ***.

      Section 8.04. Tax Matters. All transfer Taxes and similar fees and
governmental charges and all sales, use and similar Taxes and governmental
charges resulting from or relating to the transfer of the Purchased Assets to
Purchaser by Seller or resulting from or relating to the Contemplated
Transactions, shall be shared equally by Seller and Purchaser. The parties will
cooperate to minimize all such sales, transfer and/or use Taxes, recording fees
and personal property title application fees.

      Section 8.05. Further Assurances. The parties shall execute such further
documents, and perform such further acts as may be reasonably necessary to
transfer and convey the Purchased Assets to Purchaser on the terms herein
contained, and to otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement and to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions, including providing information
reasonably requested by other Persons necessary for such Persons to evaluate
whether to consent to the assignment of any Contracts or related rights or
obligations. Seller and Purchaser shall execute and deliver, as appropriate or
required and as the case may be, such other documents, certificates, agreements
and other writings and to take such other actions as may be necessary or
desirable to consummate or implement the Contemplated Transactions. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents, nothing in this
Section 8.05 or elsewhere in the Transaction Documents shall require any of
Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to make any payments or
issue any guarantee in order to obtain any consents or approvals necessary or
desirable in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

      Section 8.06. Certain Filings; Consents. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate with each other (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect
of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions,
and (b) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in taking any
such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers.

      Section 8.07. Antitrust Laws. Seller and Purchaser shall make the filings
required under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws on or before the third
day following the date of this Agreement (or, if such third day is not a
Business Day, on the first Business Day thereafter). Seller and Purchaser shall
also comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional
information, documents, or other materials received from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority,
including international competition authorities. Purchaser shall use all
reasonable commercial efforts to resolve objections, if any, that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions under any Antitrust Laws, including the HSR Act, the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, and the Federal Trade Commission Act,
as amended. If any judicial or administrative action or proceeding is initiated
(or threatened to be initiated) challenging the Contemplated Transactions as
violative of any Antitrust Law or any other Applicable Law and Seller desires to
oppose any such action or proceeding, the parties shall each cooperate to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction, ruling, decision,
finding or other order (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent) until such
time as a final, non-appealable order has been entered.

                               REGULATORY MATTERS

      Section 9.01. Regulatory Responsibility. Following the transfer of the
Regulatory Application and the Regulatory and Clinical Materials pursuant to
this Agreement, and except as otherwise contemplated in Section 4.02, Section
9.02 or in any of the Transaction Documents, Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for maintaining the Regulatory Application and obtaining all further
regulatory approvals regarding the Product, as well as all ongoing regulatory
compliance relating to the Product. For a period of up to one year after the
date of the transfer of the Regulatory Application and Regulatory and Clinical
Materials, Seller shall reasonably assist Purchaser by providing information
regarding the regulatory compliance activities performed by Seller prior to such
transfer in order to ensure an orderly transition of regulatory responsibilities
regarding the Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates
or representatives shall amend, supplement or otherwise modify the Product IND
or the Product NDA in any manner, including for the purpose of obtaining
regulatory approval for improvements upon and additional formulations of the
Product, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

      Section 9.02. Regulatory Procedures.

            (a)   In the event the Regulatory Approval has not been issued prior
to the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith after
the Closing Date to obtain Regulatory Approval of the Product. Except as
otherwise provided herein, Seller shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
diligently pursue receipt of Regulatory Approval.

            (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IX:

                  (i)   If at any time after the date of this Agreement and
      prior to the Closing Date the FDA shall request that a Product Study be
      conducted, Seller shall have the option to assume exclusive control of
      such Product Study; provided, that (A) if such Product Study shall be
      required to be completed prior to Regulatory Approval and as a
      prerequisite to such Regulatory Approval, and if Seller shall not have
      assumed control of such Product Study as of the Closing Date, the
      provisions of subsection (ii) below shall apply from and after the Closing
      Date, and (B) if such Product Study shall be required to be either (1)
      commenced prior to the date of Regulatory Approval but may be completed
      after the date of Regulatory Approval and the completion is not a
      prerequisite to Regulatory Approval, or (2) commenced and completed after
      the date of Regulatory Approval, then, and in either case, the provisions
      of subsection (iii) below shall apply from and after the Closing Date.

                  (ii)  If at any time after the Closing Date and prior to
      receipt by Seller of Regulatory Approval, the FDA shall request that a
      Product Study be conducted, and such Product Study shall be required to be
      completed prior to Regulatory Approval and as a prerequisite to such
      Regulatory Approval, Seller shall have the option to assume exclusive
      control of such Product Study and to conduct such Product Study in its
      discretion and at its expense by providing notice of such election to
      Purchaser within 60 days of the date of any such request for a Product
      Study. In the event that Seller shall refuse to conduct any such Product
      Study within such 60-day period (whether by written notice to Purchaser of
      such refusal or by lapse of such 60-day period), Purchaser shall have the
      option to assume exclusive control of such Product Study and conduct such
      Product Study in its discretion and at its expense by providing notice to
      Seller of its election within 60 days from the date of Seller's refusal.
      In the event Purchaser shall so elect to conduct any such Product Study
      within such 60-day period, Seller shall transfer to Purchaser the
      Regulatory Application and any Regulatory and Clinical Materials, to the
      extent and only to the extent necessary to permit Purchaser to conduct
      such Product Study. In the event Purchaser shall refuse to conduct any
      such Product Study (whether by written notice to Seller of such refusal or
      by lapse of such 60-day period), Seller shall have the option to (A)
      conduct such Product Study in its discretion and at its expense
      notwithstanding its prior refusal, or (B) within two years from the date
      of such request for a Product Study, repurchase from Purchaser all of the
      Purchased Assets transferred hereunder and terminate the license to the
      Technology granted to Purchaser under the License Agreement, for an
      aggregate consideration of *** and on other terms and conditions to be
      negotiated by Seller and Purchaser in good faith; provided, that nothing
      in this Section 9.02(b)(ii) shall require Seller to (x) exercise either of
      the options contemplated in subsections (A) or (B) of this sentence, or
      (y) take or refrain from taking any action in response to Purchaser's
      refusal to conduct such Product Study.

                  (iii) If at any time after the Closing Date and prior to
      receipt by Seller of Regulatory Approval the FDA shall request that a
      Product Study be conducted, and such Product Study shall be required to be
      either (A) commenced prior to the date of Regulatory Approval, but may be
      completed after the date of Regulatory Approval and the completion is not
      a prerequisite to Regulatory Approval, or (B) commenced and completed
      after Regulatory Approval, then, and in either case, Purchaser shall
      assume

      exclusive control of such Product Study and conduct such Product Study in
      its discretion and at its expense. In such event, Seller shall transfer to
      Purchaser the Regulatory Application and any Regulatory and Clinical
      Materials, to the extent and only to the extent necessary to permit
      Purchaser to conduct such Product Study.

            (c)   If (i) at any time after the Closing Date Seller or Purchaser
shall receive a Non-Approval Notice, or (ii) Regulatory Approval shall not have
been obtained by the second anniversary of the Closing Date, then in either
case, Purchaser shall have the right to demand that Seller repurchase from
Purchaser all of the Purchased Assets transferred hereunder and terminate the
license to the Technology granted to Purchaser under the License Agreement, for
an aggregate consideration of US$5,000,000 and on other terms and conditions to
be negotiated by Seller and Purchaser in good faith; provided, that Purchaser
shall provide written notice of such demand within 90 days of the issuance of
such Non-Approval Notice or the second anniversary of the Closing Date, as the
case may be.

under the HSR Act relating to the Contemplated Transactions shall have expired

United States Governmental Authority is seeking to enjoin the Contemplated
Transactions, or (ii) a final, nonappealable order entered by a United States
Governmental Authority that enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Contemplated
Transactions;

            (b)   no provision of any United States Applicable Law and no
judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the Closing;

            (c)   no Proceeding shall be pending or threatened in writing before
any court or other United States Governmental Authority that seeks to prohibit
the Closing, or impose damages or obtain other relief in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions that (i) is brought by any United States Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction in respect thereof, or (ii) is brought by any
Person (other than a Governmental Authority) if in the case of this clause (ii)
such Proceeding reasonably could be expected to prohibit the Closing or result
in a Material Adverse Effect on the Business; and

            (d)   all actions by or in respect of, or filings with, any United
States Governmental Authority required to permit the consummation of the Closing

      Section 10.02. Conditions to Obligation of Purchaser and Guarantor. The
obligations of Purchaser and Guarantor to consummate the Closing are subject to
the satisfaction (or waiver by Purchaser or Guarantor) of the following further
conditions:

            (a)   (i) Seller shall have performed in all material respects all
of its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed by it at or
prior to Closing, (ii) the representations and warranties of Seller contained
herein shall be true and correct at and as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of each such date, except that those
representations and warranties that by their express terms are made as of a
specific date shall be required to be true and correct only as of such date, in
each case except for inaccuracies that could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Business, and (iii) Purchaser shall have
received a certificate signed by an officer of Seller to the foregoing effect;

            (b)   since the date of this Agreement, no event shall have occurred
that has had a Material Adverse Effect on the Business, other than those
resulting from changes, whether actual or prospective, in general conditions
applicable to the industries in which the Business is involved or general
economic conditions; and

            (c)   Seller shall have executed and delivered, on or before the
Closing Date, the Transaction Documents.

      Section 10.03. Conditions to Obligation of Seller. The obligation of
Seller to consummate the Closing is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by
Seller) of the following further conditions:

to, or substitutions of, the Disclosure Schedules; provided, that such updates
or substitutions are clearly marked as such and are addressed to Purchaser and
Guarantor at their respective addresses listed in Section 13.01. In the event
that Seller delivers updated or substitute Disclosure Schedules within three
days of any scheduled Closing Date, Purchaser and Guarantor shall be entitled to
extend, by written notice to Seller, the scheduled Closing Date to the third day
after receipt of the updated or substitute Disclosure Schedules, or if such day

not satisfied, Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by

substituted Disclosure Schedules (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the

Seller updated by such updated or substituted Disclosure Schedules shall have
been untrue when made on the date of this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor
Guarantor shall have any claim for Damages or any other remedy against Seller
arising out of such representations and warranties other than the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.04; and provided further,
that if Purchaser and Guarantor shall consummate the Closing notwithstanding the

      Section 11.02(a)(ii)(A) exceed ***; and provided further that Purchaser

      contemplated by Section 9.02(b)(ii) or 9.02(c);

                  (ii)  the breach by Seller of this Agreement including (A) any
      material inaccuracy in or material breach of any representation or
      warranty made by Seller in this Agreement; provided, however, that (1)
      Seller shall not have any liability under this Section 11.02(b)(ii)(A)
      unless and until, and then only to the extent, the aggregate, cumulative
      amount of such Damages exceeds the Indemnity Deductible Amount, and (2) in
      no event shall the aggregate, cumulative liability of Seller for Damages
      under this Section 11.02(b)(ii)(A) exceed the Seller Indemnity Cap Amount;
      and provided further that Seller shall only have liability under this
      Section 11.02(b)(ii)(A) to the extent a Purchaser Indemnitee provides
      written notice to Seller of its claim for indemnification within the
      applicable period of limitations contemplated in Section 11.01(a), and (B)
      any material breach by Seller of, or material failure by Seller to comply
      with, any of its covenants or obligations pursuant to this Agreement;

                  (iii) the enforcement by Purchaser Indemnitees of their rights
      under this Section 11.02(b);

                  (iv)  Seller's material violation of any Applicable Law; and

                  (v)   arising out of or in any way related to the Excluded
      Liabilities;

provided, however, that (x) in each such case, Seller shall not be liable
hereunder to the extent such Damages arise from misconduct or negligence of, or
violation of Applicable Law by, Purchaser, its Affiliates, agents, employees or
contractors, or from the breach by Purchaser of the provisions of any of the
Transaction Documents, ***.

            (c)   Procedure. If any Proceeding arises as to which a right of
indemnification provided in this Article XI applies, the Person seeking
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party"), shall within 20 days notify the party
obligated under this Article XI to indemnify the Indemnified Party (the
"Indemnifying Party"), thereof in writing, except to the extent that such
failure to notify within 20 days does not prejudice the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend or contest any such Proceeding, and allow the Indemnifying
Party and its insurers the opportunity to assume direction and control of the
defense against such Proceeding, at its sole expense, including the


                                      -32-

          Confidential Materials omitted and filed separately with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission. Asterisks denote omissions.


settlement thereof at the sole option of the Indemnifying Party or its insurers;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may not enter into any compromise
or settlement without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless
such compromise or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by each plaintiff or claimant to the Indemnified Party of a release from
all liability in respect of such claim and only if such compromise or settlement
does not include any admission of legal wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its insurer in the disposition of any such matter and the
Indemnified Party will have the right and option to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any Proceeding as to which this Article XI applies, with
separate counsel at its election and cost. If the Indemnifying Party fails or
declines to assume the defense of any such Proceeding within 30 days after
notice thereof, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense thereof for the
account and at the risk of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
pay promptly to the Indemnified Party any Damages to which the indemnity under
this Article XI applies, as incurred.

      Section 11.03. Certain Limitations.

            (a)   Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01(f), the sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein and for the other matters described in
Sections 11.02(a) and 11.02(b) (other than (i) with respect to a breach of the
terms of a covenant or agreement, as to which Purchaser or Seller, as the case
may be, also shall be entitled to seek specific performance or other equitable
relief and (ii) with respect to claims for fraud) shall be a claim for Damages
(whether by contract, in tort or otherwise, and whether in law, in equity or
both) made pursuant to this Article XI. No party shall be entitled to recover
any punitive, incidental or consequential damages whatsoever under this Article
XI except to the extent any such punitive, incidental or consequential damages
shall be payable to a third party.

            (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
although a party may be entitled to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to
more than one section of this Article XI, a party shall not be entitled to
recover indemnification for the same claim under more than one section of this
Article XI.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                                   TERMINATION

      Section 12.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing Date:

            (a)   by mutual written agreement of Seller and Purchaser;

            (b)   by Seller or Purchaser if the Closing shall not have been
consummated by April 15, 2003 (as such date may be extended pursuant to this
clause (b), the "Voluntary Termination Date"); provided, however, that neither
Seller nor Purchaser may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (b) if
the Closing shall not have been consummated by the Voluntary Termination Date by
reason of the failure of such party or any of its Affiliates to


                                      -33-

          Confidential Materials omitted and filed separately with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission. Asterisks denote omissions.


perform in all material respects any of its or their respective covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; and provided further, that if the only
reason the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to April 15, 2003 is that
the condition set forth in Section 10.01(a) has not been satisfied by such date,
neither Seller nor Buyer may unilaterally terminate this Agreement until May 31,
2003;

            (c)   by either Seller or Purchaser if there shall be any United
States Applicable Law that makes consummation of the Contemplated Transactions
illegal or otherwise prohibited or if consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of
any United States Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction over such
Person; or

            (d)   by Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.04.

Any party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01
shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties to this
Agreement.

      Section 12.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 12.01, (a) this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
of no further force or effect, except for the following provisions, which shall
remain in full force and effect: (i) the representations and warranties set
forth in Sections 5.01(k) and 5.02(k) (Finder's Fees), (ii) Section 8.01
(Confidentiality), (iii) Section 8.02 (Press Releases), (iv) Section 8.04 (Tax
Matters), (v) this Section 12.02, (vi) Section 13.10 (Governing Law), (vii)
Section 13.12 (Entire Agreement), (viii) Section 13.13 (Expenses), and (ix)
Section 13.15 (Guaranty), and except that any and all claims arising prior to
such termination shall survive such termination; and (b) except as otherwise set
forth herein, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any
other party to this Agreement; provided, however, that if the Contemplated
Transactions fail to close as a result of a breach of the provisions of this
Agreement by any party, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of all such breaches if
the other parties are ready, willing and able to otherwise satisfy their
respective obligations under the Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event Purchaser shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.04 by reason of the failure of the closing condition set forth in
Section 10.02(a)(ii), Seller shall have no liability to either Purchaser or
Guarantor arising out of such termination unless, and only to the extent that,
any representation or warranty of Seller shall have been untrue when made on the
date of this Agreement. The rights and remedies provided in this Section 12.02
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
Applicable Law.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

or to such other address as the party to whom notice is to be given may have
furnished to the other party in writing in accordance herewith. Any such
communication shall be deemed to have been delivered (a) when delivered, if
delivered personally, (b) when sent (with written confirmation received), if
sent by facsimile transmission on a Business Day, (c) on the first Business Day
after dispatch (with written confirmation received), if sent by facsimile
transmission on a day other than a Business Day, (d) on the second Business Day
after dispatch, if sent by air courier, and (e) on the fifth Business Day after
mailing, if sent by mail.

      Section 13.02. Disputes. In the event of any controversy or claim arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any provision of this Agreement, or
the rights or obligations of the parties hereunder, the parties shall try to
settle their differences amicably between themselves. Any party may initiate
such informal dispute resolution by sending written notice of the dispute to the
other parties, and within 10 days after such notice, appropriate representatives
of the parties shall meet for attempted resolution by good faith negotiations.
If such representatives are unable to resolve promptly such disputed matter, it
shall be referred to the presidents of Seller, Purchaser and/or Guarantor, as
the case may be, or their respective designees, for discussion and resolution.
If such personnel are unable to resolve such dispute within 30 days of
initiating such negotiations, the parties agree first to try in good faith to
settle the dispute by mediation in Washington, D.C. under the Commercial
Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If following any such
mediation the parties still have not been able to resolve any such dispute, the
parties agree to submit the dispute to final and binding arbitration before a
single arbitrator in Washington, D.C. under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association. The parties agree that a judgment may be
entered on the arbitrator's award in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
arbitrator in reviewing any claim under this Agreement shall have the exclusive
authority to determine any issues as to the arbitrability of any such claim or
related disputes under this Agreement. In reaching a decision, the arbitrator
shall interpret, apply and be bound by this Agreement and by Applicable Law. The
arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, detract from or modify this
Agreement or any Applicable Law in any respect. The arbitrator may not grant any
remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction


                                      -36-
<PAGE>
          Confidential Materials omitted and filed separately with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission. Asterisks denote omissions.


could not grant, nor any relief or remedy greater than that sought by the
parties nor any punitive, incidental or consequential damages, except to the
extent any such punitive, incidental or consequential damages shall be payable
to a third party. Any up-front costs of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by
the parties; provided, however, that the non-prevailing party in any such
arbitration shall pay, and to the extent applicable reimburse the prevailing
party for, the costs and expenses of the arbitrator, including costs and
expenses payable to the American Arbitration Association and to the arbitrator;
and provided further, that in the event each party prevails as to certain claims
in connection with any such arbitration, the fees of the arbitrator shall be
paid and/or reimbursed in accordance with the decision of the arbitrator. Each
party shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with attorneys' fees and
related expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
13.02, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or in any way restrict the ability
of either party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court or other
judicial body. For purposes of this Section 13.02, neither the Milestone
Payments nor any other portion of the Transaction Consideration shall constitute
punitive, incidental or consequential damages.

      Section 13.03. Independent Contractors. In making and performing the
Transaction Documents, the parties are acting and shall act as independent
contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create an agency,
joint venture or partnership relationship among the parties hereto. No party
shall have the authority to obligate another party in any respect, and no party
shall hold itself out as having any such authority. All personnel of Seller
shall be solely employees of Seller and shall not represent themselves as
employees of Purchaser or Guarantor. All personnel of Purchaser and Guarantor
shall be solely employees of Purchaser and Guarantor and shall not represent
themselves as employees of Seller.

      Section 13.04. Assignment. No party shall have a right to assign this
Agreement or delegate any of its rights, interests, duties or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties (which consent
may be granted in such parties' sole discretion); provided, however, that any
party may assign this Agreement to any of its Affiliates without the prior
written consent of the other parties; and provided, further that no such
assignment of this Agreement shall relieve the assignor of any of its
obligations or liabilities under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any party may assign this Agreement without the other parties' prior written
consent in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of
its assets or business or its merger or consolidation with another Person upon
written notice to the other parties. Any attempted assignment in violation of
this Section 13.04 shall be void.

      Section 13.05. Binding Effect; Benefit. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer on any Person other than the parties hereto, and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

      Section 13.06. Amendments. This Agreement shall not be modified, amended
or supplemented except pursuant to an instrument in writing executed and
delivered on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

      Section 13.07. No Waiver. The failure in any one or more instances of a
party to insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement, to exercise any right or privilege conferred in this Agreement,
or the waiver by said party of any breach of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement, shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of
any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges, but the same shall
continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or waiver
had occurred. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by
an authorized representative of the waiving party.

      Section 13.08. Counterparts. This Agreement shall become binding when any
one or more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the
signatures of each of the parties hereto. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original as against the
party whose signature appears thereon, but all of which taken together shall
constitute but one and the same instrument. Each party may execute this
Agreement on a facsimile of the Agreement. In addition, facsimile signatures of
authorized signatories of either party shall be valid and binding and delivery
of a facsimile signature by either party shall constitute due execution and
delivery of this Agreement.

      Section 13.09. Interpretation. The article and section headings contained
in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, any
reference to the masculine, feminine or neuter gender shall include all genders,
the plural shall include the singular, and singular shall include the plural.
Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "party" when used herein means a
party hereto. References herein to a party or other Person include their
respective successors and assigns. The words "include," "includes" and
"including" when used herein shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase
"without limitation" unless such phrase otherwise appears. Unless the context
otherwise requires, references herein to Articles, Sections, Schedules and
Attachments shall be deemed references to Articles and Sections of, and
Schedules and Attachments to, this Agreement. Unless the context otherwise
requires, the words "hereof," "hereby" and "herein" and words of similar meaning
when used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to
any particular Article, Section or provision hereof. With regard to each and
every term and condition of this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that the same have or has been mutually negotiated, prepared and drafted, and
that if at any time the parties desire or are required to interpret or construe
any such term or condition or any agreement or instrument subject thereto, no
consideration shall be given to the issue of which party actually prepared,
drafted or requested any term or condition of this Agreement.

      Section 13.10. Governing Law. This Agreement and any claims, disputes or
causes of action relating to or arising out of this Agreement shall be construed
in accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.

      Section 13.11. Unenforceability. If any provisions of this Agreement are
determined to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provisions
shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability in
such jurisdiction, without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of


                                      -38-
<PAGE>
          Confidential Materials omitted and filed separately with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission. Asterisks denote omissions.


such provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. The parties will
use their best efforts to substitute the invalid or unenforceable provision with
a valid and enforceable one which conforms, as nearly as possible, with the
original intent of the parties.

      Section 13.12. Entire Agreement.

            (a)   This Agreement, together with the other Transaction Documents,
embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements,
commitments, arrangements, negotiations or understandings, whether oral or
written, among the parties hereto and their respective Affiliates with respect
thereto. There are no agreements, covenants or undertakings with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement other than those expressly set forth or
referred to herein and no representations or warranties of any kind or nature
whatsoever, express or implied, are made or shall be deemed to be made herein by
the parties hereto, except those expressly made in this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents.

            (b)   THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NO
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, PROMISE, INDUCEMENT, UNDERSTANDING, COVENANT OR
AGREEMENT HAS BEEN MADE OR RELIED UPON BY ANY PARTY HERETO OTHER THAN THOSE
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
GENERALITY OF THE DISCLAIMER SET FORTH IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, (I) NEITHER
SELLER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS MADE OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, IN ANY PRESENTATION OR WRITTEN INFORMATION
RELATING TO THE BUSINESS GIVEN OR TO BE GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, IN ANY FILING MADE OR TO BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF
SELLER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WITH ANY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY, AND NO
STATEMENT MADE IN ANY SUCH PRESENTATION OR WRITTEN MATERIALS, MADE IN ANY SUCH
FILING OR CONTAINED IN ANY SUCH OTHER INFORMATION SHALL BE DEEMED A
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY HEREUNDER OR OTHERWISE, AND (II) SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY. EACH OF PURCHASER AND
GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER HAS INFORMED IT THAT NO PERSON HAS BEEN
AUTHORIZED BY SELLER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY IN RESPECT OF THE BUSINESS OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS, UNLESS IN WRITING AND CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY OF THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS TO WHICH THEY ARE A PARTY.

      Section 13.13. Expenses. Except as expressly set forth herein, each party
hereto shall bear all fees and expenses incurred by such party in connection
with, relating to or arising out of the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, including
attorneys', accountants' and other professional fees and expenses.

      Section 13.14. Disclosure. Certain information set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules has been included and disclosed solely for informational purposes and
may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The disclosure of any such information shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgement or agreement that the information is required to
be disclosed in connection with the representations and warranties made in this
Agreement or that the information is material, nor shall any information so
included and disclosed be deemed to establish a standard of materiality or
otherwise be used to determine whether any other information is material.

      Section 13.15. Guarantor Obligations. Guarantor hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as principal obligor, and not merely
as surety, to Seller and its successors and assigns (a) the due and punctual
payment in full of the Transaction Consideration, the discharge of the Assumed
Liabilities and all other obligations of Purchaser hereunder, including
Purchaser's indemnification obligations under Article XI and Purchaser's
obligations under the Transaction Documents, and (b) the performance by Shire
Ireland of all of its duties and obligations under the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party (collectively, the "Obligations"). The foregoing obligation
of Guarantor constitutes a continuing guaranty of payment, and not of
collection, and is and shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances, including circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal
or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor. Guarantor waives any right to
require that resort for payment first be had by Seller against Purchaser and/or
Shire Ireland, as the case may be. The obligation of Guarantor hereunder shall
not be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of Seller to
assert any claim or demand against Purchaser and/or Shire Ireland, as the case
may be, or to enforce any remedy hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
nothing in this Section 13.15 shall create any liabilities or obligations for
Guarantor to the extent Purchaser and/or Shire Ireland, as the case may be,
would not have liability or otherwise be responsible to Seller hereunder, and
(ii) Guarantor shall have the right to assert as a defense (including rights of
set off and counterclaim) to any of its obligations hereunder any defense that
would be available to it had it duly authorized and entered into the Obligations
directly.

            (b) Subject to Section 3.02, Shire Ireland shall have the right to
take such action as it deems appropriate to protect and enforce the Noven
Patents in the Territory against any Competing Product, including initiating an
appropriate Proceeding or threatening to initiate an appropriate Proceeding to
prevent or eliminate the infringement of such Noven Patents with regard to any
Competing Product, or the unfair competition, inappropriate or unauthorized use,
disparagement or other tortious act by any third party in relation to the
Technology in the Territory. Subject to Section 3.01(c) below, Noven agrees to
cooperate with Shire Ireland if and to the extent reasonably requested by Shire
Ireland, including joining as a party to such Proceeding, if necessary to
maintain standing.

            (c) ***.

            (e) All amounts awarded as damages, profits or otherwise in
connection with any action specified in Section 3.01(b) taken by Shire Ireland

specified in Section 3.01(b) within 60 days of becoming aware or receiving
notice under Section 3.01(a) of any infringement, threatened infringement,
unfair competition, disparagement or other tortious act identified in Section
3.01(a), Shire Ireland shall give Noven notice of such decision, and Noven
thereafter shall have the right to take any action of the nature specified in
Section 3.01(b). In such event, all amounts awarded as damages, profits or
otherwise in connection with any action taken by Noven shall be ***.

            (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01(b), Noven shall
have the right, and Shire Ireland shall not have the right, to take such actions
as it deems appropriate to protect and enforce the Technology in any Proceeding
other than a Proceeding seeking to protect or enforce the Technology in the
Territory against a Competing Product. All amounts awarded as damages, profits
or otherwise in connection with any action specified in this Section 3.01(f)
taken by Noven shall be paid to and become the sole property of Noven.

      Section 3.02. Other Third Party Claims.

notify the other parties of the same.

            (b) ***.

            (c) ***.

            Section 3.03. Maintenance of Noven Patents. Noven shall pay all
necessary maintenance and related expenses to maintain the Noven Patents in
those jurisdictions within the Territory where the Noven Patents are currently
filed as of the Effective Date. Noven shall, from and after the Effective Date,
upon the request and at the expense of Shire Ireland, use reasonable commercial
efforts to file additional applications and to take such other reasonable
actions necessary to obtain protection of the Noven Patents in additional
jurisdictions within the Territory. Noven agrees to consult with Shire Ireland
with regard to the prosecution of the Noven Patents to the extent relating to
the Product.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                 CONFIDENTIALITY

            Section 4.01. Confidentiality.

                  (a) Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, each party (in
such capacity, the "Disclosing Party"), has disclosed and will be disclosing to
the other parties and/or their Affiliates or representatives (in such capacity,
the "Receiving Party"), certain Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party. The Receiving Party shall make no use of such Confidential Information
except in the exercise of its rights and the performance of its obligations set
forth in this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall use the same efforts to keep
secret, and prevent the disclosure to third parties of, Confidential Information
of the Disclosing Party as it would use with respect to its own Confidential
Information. Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party shall
remain the sole and absolute property of the Disclosing Party, subject to the
rights granted herein. The above restrictions on the use and disclosure of
Confidential Information shall not apply to any information which (i) is already
known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party,
as demonstrated by competent proof, (ii) is or becomes generally available to
the public other than through any act or omission of the Receiving Party in
breach of this Agreement, (iii) is acquired by the Receiving Party from a third
party who is not, directly or indirectly, under an obligation of confidentiality
to the Disclosing Party with respect to same, or (iv) is developed independently
by the Receiving Party without use, direct or indirect, of information that is
required to be held confidential hereunder.

                  (b) In the event the Receiving Party is required (i) by
Applicable Law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to
any Regulatory Authorities to obtain Regulatory Approval for the Product or to
comply with the requirement of any Regulatory Authority, (ii) to disclose
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to respond to an inquiry of a
Regulatory Authority or Governmental Authority concerning the Product, or (iii)
to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in a judicial,
administrative or

arbitration proceeding to enforce such party's rights under this Agreement, it
may do so only if it (A) provides the Disclosing Party with as much advance
written notice as possible of the required disclosure, (B) cooperates with the
Disclosing Party in any attempt to prevent or limit the disclosure, and (C)
limits disclosure, if any, to the specific purpose at issue.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.01:

                        (i) Shire Ireland shall be permitted to disclose to its
distributors, wholesalers and other direct customers such Confidential
Information relating to the Product as Shire Ireland shall reasonably determine
to be necessary or useful in order to effectively market and distribute the
Product;

                        (ii) Noven shall be permitted to disclose such
Confidential Information relating to the Product as Noven shall reasonably
determine to be necessary or useful in order to effectively perform its
obligations under the Toll Conversion and Supply Agreement;

                        (iii) Noven shall be permitted to disclose such
Confidential Information relating to the Product as it shall reasonably
determine to be necessary or useful in order to pursue or obtain any regulatory
approvals in respect of any other transdermal drug delivery products;

                        (iv) each of Noven and Shire Ireland shall be permitted
to disclose to a Regulatory Authority such Confidential Information relating to
the Product as it shall reasonably determine (but only after consulting with the
other parties to the extent practicable) to be necessary to comply with the
provisions of Applicable Law; and

                        (v) nothing in this Section 4.01 shall be interpreted to
limit the ability of either Noven or Shire Ireland to disclose its own
Confidential Information to the other parties or any other Person on such terms
and subject to such conditions as it deems advisable or appropriate;

provided, however, that in each such case any third party recipients of any
Confidential Information (other than a Regulatory Authority or other
Governmental Authority) undertake substantially the same confidentiality
obligation as the parties hereunder with respect to such Confidential
Information.

            (d) Each of Noven and Shire Ireland acknowledge and agree that the
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be considered Confidential
Information of each party and shall be treated accordingly. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Shire Ireland acknowledges and agrees that Noven may be required to
disclose some or all of the information included in this Agreement in order to
comply with its obligations under the Securities Laws, and hereby consents to
such disclosure to the extent deemed advisable or appropriate by counsel to
Noven (but only after consulting with Shire Ireland to the extent practicable).

            (e) Each party specifically recognizes that any breach by it of this
Section 4.01


                                      -9-

may cause irreparable injury to the other parties and that actual damages may be
difficult to ascertain, and in any event, may be inadequate. Accordingly (and
without limiting the availability of legal or equitable, including injunctive,
remedies under any other provisions of this Agreement), each party agrees that
in the event of any such breach, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.02
or Article VI hereof, the other parties shall be entitled to seek, by way of
private litigation in the first instance, injunctive relief and such other legal
and equitable remedies as may be available.

            Section 4.02. Press Releases. Except as may be required by
Applicable Law, no party shall originate any publicity, press or news release or
other public announcement, written or oral, whether to the public press or
otherwise, relating to this Agreement, or to the existence of an arrangement
between the parties, without the prior written approval of the other parties. In
the event disclosure of this Agreement, or any of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement is required by Applicable Law, the party required to so disclose
such information shall, to the extent possible, provide to the other parties for
their prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
a written copy of such public announcement. When practicable, the party required
to disclose such information will provide such copy to the other parties at
least five Business Days prior to disclosure.

                                   ARTICLE V
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SHIRE IRELAND

      Section 5.01. Representations and Warranties of Shire Ireland. Shire
Ireland represents and warrants to Noven as of the Effective Date that:

            (a) Organization. Shire Ireland is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation. As of the Closing Date, Shire Ireland will be duly qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction where the character of its business (after
giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions) make such qualifications
necessary to carry on its business.

            (b) Power, Authority and Enforceability. Shire Ireland has full
corporate power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein. This Agreement has been or
shall be duly executed and delivered by duly authorized signatories of Shire
Ireland. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Shire
Ireland, enforceable against Shire Ireland in accordance with its terms, except
as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally.

            (c) No Violation. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation by Shire Ireland of the transactions contemplated
hereby, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of Shire Ireland's certificate of incorporation or
other governing or charter document, or of any statute or administrative
regulation, or, to the best of its knowledge, of any order, writ, injunction,
judgment or decree of

any court or governmental authority or of any arbitration award or any agreement
binding upon Shire Ireland or its assets, or (ii) to the best of its knowledge,
contravene or conflict with, or constitute a violation of, any provisions of any
Applicable Law binding upon Shire Ireland.

            (d) No Default. Shire Ireland is not a party to any unexpired,
undischarged or unsatisfied written or oral contract, agreement, indenture,
mortgage, debenture, note or other instrument under the terms of which
performance by Shire Ireland according to the terms of this Agreement will be a
default, or whereby timely performance by Shire Ireland according to the terms
of this Agreement may be prohibited, prevented or delayed.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

      Section 6.01. Indemnification. In order to distribute between themselves
the responsibility for claims arising out of this Agreement, and except as
otherwise specifically provided for herein, from and after the Effective Date,
the parties shall indemnify each other as provided in this Section 6.01.

            (a) Indemnification Obligations of Shire Ireland. From and after the
Effective Date, Shire Ireland shall defend, indemnify and hold Noven, its
Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, employees
and shareholders (collectively, "Noven Indemnitees"), harmless from and against
any and all Damages which Noven Indemnitees may incur or suffer, or with which
any of them may be faced arising out of:

                  (i) the breach by Shire Ireland of this Agreement including
any material breach by Shire Ireland of, or material failure by Shire Ireland to
comply with, any of its covenants or obligations pursuant to this Agreement;

                  (ii) the enforcement by Noven Indemnitees of their rights
under this Section 6.01(a); and

                  (iii) Shire Ireland's material violation of any Applicable
Law;

provided, however, that, in each such case, Shire Ireland shall not be liable
hereunder to the extent such Damages arise from misconduct or negligence of, or
a violation of any Applicable Law by Noven, its Affiliates, agents, employees or
contractors, or from the breach by Noven of the provisions of any of the
Transaction Documents.

            (b) Indemnification Obligations of Noven. From and after the
Effective Date, Noven shall defend, indemnify and hold Shire Ireland, its
Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, employees,
shareholders or members (collectively, "Shire Ireland Indemnitees") harmless
from and against any and all Damages which Shire Ireland Indemnitees may incur
or suffer, or with which any of them may be faced arising out of:

                  (i) the breach by Noven of this Agreement including any
material breach by Noven of, or material failure by Noven to comply with, any of
its covenants or

obligations pursuant to this Agreement;

                  (ii) the enforcement by Shire Ireland Indemnitees of their
rights under this Section 6.01(b); and

                  (iii) Noven's material violation of any Applicable Law;

provided, however, that, in each such case, Noven shall not be liable hereunder
to the extent such Damages arise from misconduct or negligence of, or a
violation of any Applicable Law by Shire Ireland, its Affiliates, agents,
employees or contractors, or from the breach by Shire Ireland of any of the
provisions of the Transaction Documents.

            (c) Procedure. If any Proceeding arises as to which a right of
indemnification provided in this Article VI applies, the Person seeking
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party"), shall within 20 days notify the party
obligated under this Article VI to indemnify the Indemnified Party (the
"Indemnifying Party"), thereof in writing, except to the extent that such
failure to notify within 20 days does not prejudice the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend or contest any such Proceeding, and allow the Indemnifying
Party and its insurers the opportunity to assume direction and control of the
defense against such Proceeding, at its sole expense, including the settlement
thereof at the sole option of the Indemnifying Party or its insurers; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party may not enter into any compromise or
settlement without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless
such compromise or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by each plaintiff or claimant to the Indemnified Party of a release from
all liability in respect of such claim and only if such compromise or settlement
does not include any admission of legal wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its insurer in the disposition of any such matter and the
Indemnified Party will have the right and option to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any Proceeding as to which this Article VI applies, with
separate counsel at its election and cost. If the Indemnifying Party fails or
declines to assume the defense of any such Proceeding within 30 days after
notice thereof, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense thereof for the
account and at the risk of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
pay promptly to the Indemnified Party any Damages to which the indemnity under
this Article VI applies, as incurred.

      Section 6.02. Certain Limitations.

            (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.01(e), the sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein and for the other matters described in
Sections 6.01(a) and 6.01(b) (other than (i) with respect to a breach of the
terms of a covenant or agreement, as to which Shire Ireland or Noven, as the
case may be, also shall be entitled to seek specific performance or other
equitable relief and (ii) with respect to claims for fraud) shall be a claim for
Damages (whether by contract, in tort or otherwise, and whether in law, in
equity or both) made pursuant to this Article VI. No party shall be entitled to
recover any punitive, incidental or consequential damages whatsoever under this
Article VI, except to the extent any such punitive, incidental or consequential
damages are payable to a third party.

more than one section of this Article VI, a party shall not be entitled to

Article VI.

Territory shall (a) expire by its terms, or (b) be adjudicated invalid or

jurisdiction, which judgment shall not be subject to appeal; provided, that
following any such termination, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right
of Shire Ireland to market and sell the Product.

      Section 7.03. Effect of Termination. Upon termination, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and of no further force or effect, except for the
following provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect: (a) Section

      Section 8.02. Disputes. In the event of any controversy or claim arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any provision of this Agreement, or
the rights or obligations of the parties hereunder, the parties shall try to
settle their differences amicably between themselves. Any party may initiate
such informal dispute resolution by sending written notice of the dispute to the
other parties, and within 10 days after such notice, appropriate representatives
of the parties shall meet for attempted resolution by good faith negotiations.
If such representatives are unable to resolve promptly such disputed matter, it
shall be referred to the presidents of Noven and Shire Ireland, or their
respective designees, for discussion and resolution. If such personnel are
unable to resolve such dispute within 30 days of initiating such negotiations,
the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation
in Washington, D.C. under the Commercial Mediation Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. If following any such mediation the parties still have
not been able to resolve any such dispute, the parties agree to submit the
dispute to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator in
Washington, D.C. under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The parties agree that a judgment may be entered on the
arbitrator's award in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator in
reviewing any claim under this Agreement shall have the exclusive authority to
determine any issues as to the arbitrability of any such claim or related
disputes under this Agreement. In reaching a decision, the arbitrator shall
interpret, apply and be bound by this Agreement and by Applicable Law. The
arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, detract from or modify this
Agreement or any Applicable Law in any respect. The arbitrator may not grant any
remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could not grant, nor any
relief or remedy greater than that sought by the parties, nor any punitive,
incidental or consequential damages, except to the extent any such punitive,
incidental or consequential damages are payable to a third party. Any up-front
costs of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties; provided,
however, that the non-prevailing party in any such arbitration shall pay, and to

            (b)   Manufacturer and Principal shall appoint as members of the
Steering Committee a reasonable number of suitably qualified and experienced
representatives of each of Manufacturer and Principal and shall each designate

      Section 3.02. Initial Order. Manufacturer and Principal hereby acknowledge
and agree that, in order to address Principal's initial requirements for the
commercial launch of the Product and for the month after commercial launch***.

      Section 3.03. Future Orders. From and after the initial production period
contemplated by Section 3.02, Principal shall submit to Manufacturer standard
form purchase orders in the form of Exhibit C hereto (each, a "Purchase Order"),
for each order placed by Principal pursuant to this Agreement. With respect to
each of the 12-month forecasts to be provided by Principal in accordance with
Section 3.01, the quantities set forth for the first three months of each such
12-month period shall constitute firm and binding orders for such forecasted
quantities and shall be subject to binding Purchase Orders. The quantities set
forth for the fourth, fifth and six months of each such 12-month period shall
constitute partially binding orders, such that Principal shall be bound to
purchase, for any particular month, *** of the Batches of each size of the
Product forecasted by Principal for such month at the time that such month was
the sixth month in any 12-month forecast; provided, that upon request by
Principal, Manufacturer shall attempt in good faith to supply a quantity of the
Product in excess of *** of the Batches previously forecasted by Principal for
any such month. Each Purchase Order shall indicate a specific delivery date,
which date shall be no sooner than 90 days after submission of any such Purchase
Order to Manufacturer. Principal shall be bound to purchase, and Manufacturer,
subject to Sections 3.06, 3.07 and 11.14, shall be bound to Manufacture and
deliver to Principal by the applicable delivery date, the Product ordered
pursuant to each Purchase Order properly submitted to Manufacturer. Each
Purchase Order shall be placed in a minimum quantity, as to each size of the
Product, equal to one Batch of such Product size and in increments of additional
Batches thereafter. In the event that the terms and conditions of any Purchase
Order are inconsistent with or conflict with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern.

      Section 3.04. Annual Installed Capacity. Manufacturer and Principal
acknowledge and agree that Manufacturer's maximum installed capacity for
production of the Product for the remainder of calendar year 2003 is *** units
of Product per month (the "Annual Installed Capacity"). ***. For calendar years
after 2003, the Steering Committee shall consult to evaluate and review the
Annual Installed Capacity as represented by Manufacturer to Principal from time
to time and the then effective forecasts delivered by Principal to identify any
potential shortfalls in Manufacturer's capacity that need to be addressed by
Manufacturer and Principal. Forecasts submitted by Principal pursuant to Section
3.01 and orders placed by Principal pursuant to Sections 3.02 and 3.03, as to
any month, shall be for quantities of the Product that fall within
Manufacturer's Annual Installed Capacity for such month.

      Section 3.05. Active Ingredient Quota. On April 1 of each calendar year,
Principal shall deliver to Manufacturer a forecast of its requirements of the
Product for the following calendar year, for the purpose of assisting
Manufacturer in projecting its demand for the Active Ingredient for such
calendar year for submission to and approval by the DEA. The Steering Committee
shall consult in good faith in September of each calendar year in order to
determine whether any adjustments to such projection and the related quota are
appropriate.

      Section 3.06. Excused Vendor Default. In the event Manufacturer or
Principal shall become aware of an actual or potential Excused Vendor Default
that such party reasonably

                                      -9-

         Securities and Exchange Commission. Asterisks denote omissions.

anticipates will adversely affect Manufacturer's ability to ship on the delivery
date set forth in any Purchase Order such party shall provide notice thereof to
the other as soon as practicable. In the event of such an Excused Vendor
Default, Manufacturer and Principal shall cooperate to establish a reasonable
new delivery date. Manufacturer's failure to meet any delivery date set forth in
a Purchase Order by reason of an Excused Vendor Default shall neither (a)
constitute a breach by Manufacturer of the terms of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.02(b), nor (b) be considered as a delivery failure for purposes of
Section 4.08 or Section 10.02(c).

      Section 3.07. Delivery. The actual number of units delivered pursuant to
any Purchase Order for the Manufacture of the Product shall be equal to the
number of units of each size of the Product or placebos of the Product, as the
case may be, produced in each Batch thereof, subject to reduction of the number
of units produced in any Batch by the number of units not suitable for release
or otherwise retained pursuant to the provisions of the Quality Assurance
Agreement. In the event Manufacturer shall deliver less than *** of the units
ordered by Principal pursuant to any Purchase Order (which number of units shall
be determined with reference to the number of units estimated to be yielded by
each Batch ordered by Principal as reflected on Exhibit A), Manufacturer shall
notify Principal in writing of the amount of such shortfall upon delivery of the
Product to Principal. Principal shall, within 30 days of receipt of such
delivery, either (a) accept such delivery in full satisfaction of the Purchase
Order (as to quantity only and not in waiver of Principal's opportunity to
reject such Product pursuant to Section 3.09), or (b) issue a replacement
Purchase Order for an additional Batch of the Product, and Manufacturer shall
use reasonable commercial efforts to deliver such Product within 60 days of the
date of such replacement Purchase Order; provided, that in either case Principal
shall accept and pay Manufacturer the Conversion Price for the units of Product
delivered and Manufacturer shall, to the extent applicable, be subject to the
financial provisions of Section 4.08. Principal's failure to issue a replacement
Purchase Order within such 30-day period shall be deemed as an acceptance of
such delivery pursuant to subsection (a) above. Any replacement Purchase Order
submitted by Principal to Manufacturer pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions of this Agreement as a Purchase Order
submitted pursuant to Section 3.03.

      Section 3.08. Shipment. Title to and insurable interest in the Active
Ingredient shall remain with Principal at all times during Manufacture of the
Product. Shipment of the Product shall be FOB Manufacturer's Manufacturing
Facility. Title to shipments of the Product (other than that portion
constituting the Active Ingredient) and risk of loss in respect thereof shall
pass to Principal upon placement of such shipments at the disposal of
Principal's designated carrier at Manufacturer's Manufacturing Facility.
Principal shall ensure the use of temperature-controlled vehicles for shipment
of the Product to ensure that the viability of the Product is maintained in
accordance with the Specifications. All actual transportation costs and all
costs and charges associated with shipping the Product shall be borne entirely
by Principal; provided, that Manufacturer shall arrange for and pay the costs of
handling and transporting the Product to Principal and shall invoice Principal
for such costs and expenses. Principal shall deliver to Manufacturer a list of
preferred carriers, and Manufacturer shall select the carrier therefrom.

      Section 3.09. Acceptance of Product.

            (a)   Principal shall, (i) in the case of defects which are
determinable by testing upon receipt in accordance with standard quality control
procedures or are otherwise apparent, within 30 days after Principal receives
delivery of shipment of the Product, or (ii) in the case of latent defects,
within 30 days from the date that Principal should have discovered such defect,
notify Manufacturer in writing of any rejection of any such Product (a
"Rejection Notice"), on the basis of (A) any non-compliance with the
Specifications of all or any part of said shipment or the occurrence of an Out
of Trend Event that gives rise to a right of rejection under Section 3.09(f), or
(B) failure of any such shipment to conform with any product warranty set forth
in Section 5.01, to the extent such non-compliance or failure is not due to the
fault of Principal. Failure to provide a possible Rejection Notice to
Manufacturer within the applicable 30-day period shall constitute acceptance by
Principal of the shipment, and Manufacturer shall have no liability for any
deviations for which it has not received notice within such 30-day period. Any
such possible Rejection Notice shall state in reasonable detail (sufficient to
enable Manufacturer to identify the nature of the problem for tests or studies
to be conducted by or on its behalf or to dispute the same) the reason why
Principal believes the Product may not be acceptable to Principal. Principal
shall, within five days of the delivery by Principal of any such possible
Rejection Notice, provide samples of the Product being rejected, if appropriate,
and copies of written reports relating to tests, studies or investigations
performed to that date by or on behalf of Principal on the Batch of the Product
being rejected.

            (b)   Principal's test results or basis for rejection shall be
conclusive unless Manufacturer notifies Principal, within 30 days of receipt by
Manufacturer of the Rejection Notice, that it disagrees with such test results
or basis for rejection. If Principal and Manufacturer fail to agree within 10
days after Manufacturer's notice to Principal as to whether any Product
identified in the Rejection Notice deviates from the Specifications,
representative samples of the Batch of the Product in question shall be
submitted to a mutually acceptable independent laboratory or consultant (if not
a laboratory analysis issue) for analysis or review. The results of such
evaluation shall be binding upon the parties. If Manufacturer and Principal
determine by agreement or if such evaluation certifies that the Product was
properly rejected by Principal, Principal may reject the Product in the manner
contemplated by Section 3.09(e). The party that is determined to have been
incorrect in its determination of whether the Product should be rejected shall
pay the costs of any such evaluation. ***.

            (c)   In the event of a dispute (other than disputes in relation to
the matters set out in Section 3.09(b)) between Manufacturer and Principal that
is exclusively related to technical aspects of the manufacturing, packaging,
labeling, quality control testing, handling, storage or other activities under
this Agreement (a "Technical Dispute"), Manufacturer and Principal shall make
all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute by amicable negotiations pursuant
to Section 11.02.

            (d)   If any order of the Product is rejected by Principal,
Principal's duty to pay all amounts payable to Manufacturer in respect of the
rejected Product shall be suspended unless the rejection is rescinded as per
Section 3.09(b). If only a portion of an order is rejected, only the duty to pay
the amount allocable to such portion shall be suspended.

            (e)   In the event an order or partial order is rejected by
Principal pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.09, Principal shall
return to Manufacturer (or, at the election of Manufacturer, destroy and provide
evidence of such destruction to Manufacturer) any units of such rejected
Product. Manufacturer shall, at Principal's election, (i) credit the original
invoice in respect of the rejected Product and re-invoice Principal for the
units that were not rejected and offset any reasonable expenses related to the
return or destruction against other amounts then due Manufacturer hereunder, or
(ii) at Manufacturer's cost and expense, replace such rejected Product with
conforming Product as soon as practicable after Manufacturer's receipt of
Principal's instructions to deliver replacement Product and credit Principal any
reasonable expenses related to the return or destruction of the rejected
Product; provided, however, that in either case Manufacturer shall have no
liability or obligation to Principal under this Section 3.09(e) if it is
determined that any such defect is attributable to the failure by any Person
(including Principal) to properly store, transport or care for any unit of such
Product after such Product left Manufacturer's possession.

            (f)   If an Out of Trend Event shall occur, Manufacturer and
Principal shall commence a review of the relevant data and commence an
investigation in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Quality
Assurance Agreement. The results of such investigation shall be reviewed by the
Steering Committee or its designees and if the Steering Committee or its
designees determines that the Out of Trend Event is reasonably expected to
result in a recall or other adverse event and Principal decides not to release
the Batch that is the subject of the Out of Trend Event, Principal shall be
entitled to reject such Product within 30 days of such determination.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                          CONVERSION PRICE AND PAYMENT

provisions of Section 3.09(d) and Section 3.09(e), payment for each delivery of
the Product to Principal shall be due within 30 days after the date of
Manufacturer's invoice. All payments required to be made hereunder shall be paid
in United States dollars and made by corporate check drawn on a United States
bank or a United States branch of a foreign bank, or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the financial institution, account number and
account party's name designated in writing by Manufacturer to Principal from
time to time. Overdue invoices shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month
until such amount is paid.

      Section 4.02. Conversion Price. Subject to adjustment as set forth in this
Article IV, Principal agrees to pay Manufacturer the Conversion Price per unit
of the Product, which Conversion Price for units of each size of the Product,
and for placebos of the Product, respectively, as of the Effective Date shall be
as set forth in Exhibit D. ***.

      Section 4.03. Adjustment of Product Gross Cost Resulting from Adjustments
to Active Ingredient Cost. Manufacturer and Principal acknowledge that changes
in the Active Ingredient Cost will impact the calculations of Product Gross Cost
as presented on Exhibit D1. Exhibit F

materials acceptance process, which determination shall be made in
Manufacturer's sole discretion. A copy of Manufacturer's alternative raw
materials acceptance process will be provided to Principal upon signing of this

      Section 4.05. Adjustment Pursuant to Producer Price Index.

            (a)   On January 1, 2005 and on January 1 of each year thereafter,
the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to the Producer Price Index for
Pharmaceutical Preparations published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of
Labor Statistics (the "Index"). Any such adjustment shall be determined by
multiplying the respective Conversion Price for each size of the Product, and
for placebos of the Product, by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
value of the Index set forth in this Section 4.05(a) for the month of June of
the year prior to the year in which the computation is made, and the denominator
of which shall be the value of the Index for June 2003. For example, when
adjusting the Conversion Price in January 2005, the numerator shall be the Index
value for June 2004 and the denominator shall be the Index value for June 2003.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any given calendar year no increase of the
Conversion Price in excess of *** shall be made pursuant to this Section
4.05(a).

            (b)   Should the publication of said Index be discontinued by said
U.S. Department of Labor, then such other indexes as may be published by said
Department most nearly approaching said discontinued Index shall be used in
determining the adjustment hereunder. Should said Department discontinue the
publication of any such index, then such index as may be published by another
United States governmental agency, as most nearly approximating the Index, shall
govern and be substituted as the Index hereunder.

      Section 4.06. Adjustment for Modification of Specifications. In the event
a change in the Specifications pursuant to Section 5.03 shall result in
increased packaging or production costs to Manufacturer, (a) ***, (b) Principal
shall reimburse Manufacturer for the costs of implementing any changes requested
by Principal in labeling, packaging and preprinting of backing or pouch
materials and of discontinuing stock of the same due to such changes, and (c)
any inventory of Manufacturer, including work-in-progress and finished goods
rendered obsolete or rejected as a result of a formula, process, artwork or
packaging change requested by Principal or required by any Regulatory Authority
shall be reimbursed to Manufacturer by Principal at Manufacturer's standard
cost.

with the importation of Material).

      Section 4.08. Adjustment for Late Deliveries. In the event that a
particular order of the Product is not delivered within 30 days of the delivery
date set forth on the applicable Purchase Order therefor, Principal may, in its
sole discretion, on the 31st day after such delivery date, impose a ***
reduction in the Conversion Price for such order and may, in the event such
order has not been delivered within 60 days and/or 90 days after such
acknowledged delivery date, in its sole discretion, on the 61st and/or 91st day
after such delivery date, impose additional *** reductions in the Conversion
Price for each such shipment; provided, that Principal shall only have rights
pursuant to this Section 4.08 in the event Manufacturer shall fail to deliver
Product pursuant to a Purchase Order for any reason other than yield variations;
and provided further, that Manufacturer shall have no rights pursuant to this
Section 4.08 in the event that the cause for such late delivery is due to (a) a
circumstance contemplated by Section 11.14, (b) an Excused Vendor Default, or
(c) the fault of Principal.

               ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

      Section 7.01. Confidentiality.

            (a) Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, each party (in such
capacity, the "Disclosing Party"), has disclosed and will be disclosing to the
other parties and/or their Affiliates or representatives (in such capacity, the
"Receiving Party"), certain Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.
The Receiving Party shall make no use of such Confidential Information except in
the exercise of its rights and the performance of its obligations set forth in
this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall use the same efforts to keep secret,
and prevent the disclosure to third parties of, Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party as it would use with respect to its own Confidential
Information. Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party shall
remain the sole and absolute property of the Disclosing Party, subject to the
rights granted herein. The above restrictions on the use and disclosure of
Confidential Information shall not apply to any information which (i) is already
known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party,
as demonstrated by competent proof, (ii) is or becomes generally available to
the public other than through any act or omission of the Receiving Party in
breach of this Agreement, (iii) is acquired by the Receiving Party from a third
party who is not, directly or indirectly, under an obligation of confidentiality
to the Disclosing Party with respect to same, or (iv) is developed independently
by the Receiving Party without use, direct or indirect, of information that is
required to be held confidential hereunder.

            (b) In the event the Receiving Party is required (i) by Applicable
Law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any
Regulatory Authorities to obtain Regulatory Approval for the Product or to
comply with the requirement of any Regulatory Authority, (ii) to disclose
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to respond to an inquiry of a
Regulatory Authority or Governmental Authority concerning the Product, or (iii)
to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in a judicial,
administrative or arbitration proceeding to enforce such party's rights under
this Agreement, it may do so only if it (A) provides the Disclosing Party with
as much advance written notice as possible of the required disclosure, (B)
cooperates with the Disclosing Party in any attempt to prevent or limit the
disclosure, and (C) limits disclosure, if any, to the specific purpose at issue.

            (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7.01:

                  (i) Principal shall be permitted to disclose to its
      distributors, wholesalers and other direct customers such Confidential
      Information relating to the Product as Principal shall reasonably
      determine to be necessary or useful in order to effectively market and
      distribute the Product;

                  (ii) Manufacturer shall be permitted to disclose such
      Confidential Information relating to the Product as Manufacturer shall
      reasonably determine to be necessary or useful in order to effectively
      perform its obligations under this Agreement;

         Securities and Exchange Commission. Asterisks denote omissions.


                  (iii) Manufacturer shall be permitted to disclose such
      Confidential Information relating to the Product as it shall reasonably
      determine to be necessary or useful in order to pursue or obtain any
      regulatory approvals in respect of any other transdermal drug delivery
      products;

                  (iv) each of Manufacturer and Principal shall be permitted to
      disclose to a Regulatory Authority such Confidential Information relating
      to the Product as it shall reasonably determine (but only after consulting
      with the other parties to the extent practicable) to be necessary to
      comply with the provisions of Applicable Law; and

                  (v) nothing in this Section 7.01 shall be interpreted to limit
      the ability of either Manufacturer or Principal to disclose its own
      Confidential Information to the other parties or any other Person on such
      terms and subject to such conditions as it deems advisable or appropriate;

provided, however, that in each such case any third party recipients of any
Confidential Information (other than a Regulatory Authority or other
Governmental Authority) undertake substantially the same confidentiality
obligation as the parties hereunder with respect to such Confidential
Information.

            (d) Each of Manufacturer and Principal acknowledge and agree that
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be considered Confidential
Information of each party and shall be treated accordingly. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Principal acknowledges and agrees that Manufacturer may be required
to disclose some or all of the information included in this Agreement in order
to comply with its obligations under the Securities Laws, and hereby consents to
such disclosure to the extent deemed advisable or appropriate by counsel to
Manufacturer (but only after consulting with Principal to the extent
practicable).

            (e) Each party specifically recognizes that any breach by it of this
Section 7.01 may cause irreparable injury to the other parties and that actual
damages may be difficult to ascertain, and in any event, may be inadequate.
Accordingly (and without limiting the availability of legal or equitable,
including injunctive, remedies under any other provisions of this Agreement),
each party agrees that in the event of any such breach, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 11.02 or Article IX hereof, the other parties shall be
entitled to seek, by way of private litigation in the first instance, injunctive
relief and such other legal and equitable remedies as may be available.

      Section 7.02. Safety. Manufacturer shall comply with all applicable health
and safety regulations, policies and procedures relating to the manufacture and
packaging of the Product, including the transmission by Manufacturer to its
employees of health and safety information relating to the Product, its
manufacture, storage, disposal and transportation.

      Section 7.03. Product Recall. Product recalls shall be conducted in
accordance with the terms of the Quality Assurance Agreement. Each of
Manufacturer and Principal shall make a permanent, complete and accurate record
of all costs incurred by its connection with any Product recall, a copy of which
shall be delivered to the other as soon after the completion of such recall

or seizure as practically may be done. If the cause of or reason for said recall
or seizure arises from or is attributable to Manufacturer's negligence or breach
of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall reimburse Principal for all reasonable
costs incurred by Principal in effecting such recall or seizure. If the cause of
or reason for said recall or seizure is directly attributable to the negligence
of, or breach of this Agreement by, Principal, Principal shall reimburse
Manufacturer for all reasonable costs incurred by Manufacturer at Principal's
request in effecting such recall or seizure. If Manufacturer and Principal
cannot agree which party is at fault, then an independent technical expert,
acceptable to both, will be designated to make the determination. The so
designated technical expert shall not be an employee, consultant, officer,
director or shareholder of or otherwise associated with any party or an
Affiliate of any party. The technical expert's determination shall be, in the
absence of fraud or manifest error, binding and conclusive upon the parties.

      Section 7.04. Insurance. Throughout the Term, each of Manufacturer and
Principal shall maintain commercial liability insurance, including blanket
commercial liability insurance covering the obligation of that party under this
Agreement through the term of this Agreement and for five years thereafter,
which insurance shall afford limits of not less than *** per occurrence, (and in
the aggregate only with respect to personal injury liability) for bodily injury
liability, products liability, property damage liability, contractual liability
and completed operations liability with an insurance carrier qualified to do
business in the United States. Each of Manufacturer and Principal shall promptly
furnish to the other evidence of the maintenance of the insurance required
hereunder and shall name the other as an "additional insured" under a broad form
vendor's endorsement to such insurance policy. In case any such policies are
written on a "claims made" basis, such policies shall remain in effect for a
period of five years following the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of each of Manufacturer
and Principal to obtain insurance in accordance with this Section 7.04 is
subject to the availability of such insurance from nationally recognized
carriers at reasonable rates and on reasonable terms and conditions, which
reasonableness shall be determined in the judgment of each party, respectively,
in accordance with such party's past practices in the ordinary course of
business. In the event either party shall be unable to obtain insurance as
contemplated by this Section 7.04, such party shall notify the other party as
soon as practicable and shall have the right to self-insure such coverage;
provided that any party opting to so self-insure shall provide to the other
party reasonable information regarding its self-insurance program.

      Section 7.05. Ultimate Use of Product. Manufacturer and Principal
acknowledge and agree that Manufacturer has no control over the ultimate use of
the Product and Manufacturer shall have no liability in connection with any such
use, provided, that such liability does not result from Manufacturer's
negligence or breach of the terms of this Agreement.

      Section 7.06. Intellectual Property Matters. Manufacturer and Principal
acknowledge and agree that all matters governing the ownership, license, and
rights, title and interest in and to the Technology and any other Intellectual
Property associated with the Product, including any improvements, inventions,
discoveries or other future developments related thereto, shall be governed by
the terms and conditions of the License Agreement.

      Section 7.07. No Debarred Persons. Each of Manufacturer and Principal
covenants and agrees that it has not and will not use in any capacity the
services of any Person debarred under subsections (a) or (b) of Section 306 of
the FDC Act in connection with its performance of this Agreement.

      Section 7.08. Labeling. All labeling and artwork approved, designated or
supplied by Principal shall be in compliance with all Applicable Laws and
Regulatory Standards. Compliance with all federal, state and local laws shall be
the sole responsibility of Principal, provided that Manufacturer shall process
such packaging and labeling in accordance with the Specifications and all
applicable Regulatory Standards, including the GMPs.

      Section 7.09. Second Source Arrangements.

            (a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring ***,
Manufacturer and Principal shall consult in good faith with a view toward
determining whether they are able to reach an agreement upon terms and
conditions on which Manufacturer shall establish a second site of Manufacturer
for purposes of the Manufacture of the Product.

            (b) In the event that, by ***, Manufacturer and Principal are unable
to reach agreement upon the terms and conditions on which Manufacturer shall
establish a second site of Manufacturer for purposes of the Manufacture of the
Product, Principal shall be entitled to take steps to qualify a third-party
second source supplier of the Product (the "Alternative Supplier"), which
Alternative Supplier shall be subject to approval of Manufacturer, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. All costs and expenses,
including out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Manufacturer, associated with
qualifying an Alternative Supplier shall be borne by Principal.

            (c) Upon the written request of Principal, in the event Principal
seeks to qualify an Alternative Supplier pursuant to Section 7.09(b),
Manufacturer shall provide reasonable assistance to such Alternative Supplier
and access to such of its Confidential Information and Technology as may be
reasonably necessary for the Alternative Supplier to Manufacture the Product for
sale to Principal.

            (c) Procedure. If any Proceeding arises as to which a right of
indemnification provided in this Article IX applies, the Person seeking
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party"), shall within 20 days notify the party
obligated under this Article IX to indemnify the Indemnified Party (the
"Indemnifying Party"), thereof in writing, except to the extent that such
failure to notify within 20 days does not prejudice the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend or contest any such Proceeding, and allow the Indemnifying
Party and its insurers the opportunity to assume direction and control of the
defense against such Proceeding, at its sole expense, including the settlement
thereof at the sole option of the Indemnifying Party or its insurers; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party may not enter into any compromise or
settlement without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless
such compromise or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by each plaintiff or claimant to the Indemnified Party of a release from
all liability in respect of such claim and only if such compromise or settlement
does not include any admission of legal wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its insurer in the disposition of any such matter and the
Indemnified Party will have the right and option to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any Proceeding as to which this Article IX applies, with
separate counsel at its election and cost. If the Indemnifying Party fails or
declines to assume the defense of any Proceeding within 30 days after notice
thereof, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense thereof for the account
and at the risk of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall pay
promptly to the Indemnified Party any Damages to which the indemnity under this
Article IX applies, as incurred.

Damages (whether by contract, in tort or otherwise, and whether in law, in

Article IX except to the extent any such punitive, incidental or consequential
damages shall be payable to a third party.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,

      Section 11.02. Disputes. In the event of any controversy or claim arising

the rights or obligations of the parties hereunder, the parties shall try to
settle their differences amicably between themselves. Any party may initiate
such informal dispute resolution by sending written notice of the dispute to the
other parties, and within 10 days after such notice, appropriate representatives
of the parties shall meet for attempted resolution by good faith negotiations.
If such representatives are unable to resolve promptly such disputed matter, it
shall be referred to the presidents of Manufacturer and Principal, or their
respective designees, for discussion and resolution. If such personnel are
unable to resolve such dispute within 30 days of initiating such negotiations,
the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation
in Washington, D.C. under the Commercial Mediation Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. If following any such mediation the parties still have
not been able to resolve any such dispute, the parties agree to submit the
dispute to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator in

<PAGE>
          Confidential Materials omitted and filed separately with the

Washington, D.C. under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The parties agree that a judgment may be entered on the
arbitrator's award in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator in
reviewing any claim under this Agreement shall have the exclusive authority to
determine any issues as to the arbitrability of any such claim or related
disputes under this Agreement. In reaching a decision, the arbitrator shall
interpret, apply and be bound by this Agreement and by Applicable Law. The
arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, detract from or modify this
Agreement or any Applicable Law in any respect. The arbitrator may not grant any
remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could not grant, nor any
relief or remedy greater than that sought by the parties, nor any punitive,
incidental or consequential damages, except to the extent any such punitive,
incidental or consequential damages shall be payable to a third party. Any
up-front costs of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties;
provided, however, that the non-prevailing party in any such arbitration shall
pay, and to the extent applicable reimburse the prevailing party for, the costs
and expenses of the arbitrator, including costs and expenses payable to the
American Arbitration Association and to the arbitrator; and provided further,
that in the event each party prevails as to certain claims in connection with
any such arbitration, the fees of the arbitrator shall be paid and/or reimbursed
in accordance with the decision of the arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own
costs incurred in connection with attorneys' fees and related expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.02, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or in any way restrict the ability of any party to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief in a court or other judicial body.

      Section 11.03. Independent Contractors. In making and performing this
Agreement, the parties are acting and shall act as independent contractors.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create an agency, joint venture or
partnership relationship between the parties hereto. No party shall have the
authority to obligate another party in any respect, and no party shall hold
itself out as having any such authority. All personnel of Manufacturer shall be
solely employees of Manufacturer and shall not represent themselves as employees
of Principal. All personnel of Principal shall be solely employees of Principal
and shall not represent themselves as employees of Manufacturer.

      Section 11.04. Assignment. Prior to the date on which Shire has paid
Manufacturer the full amount of the Milestone Payments, Principal shall not have
the right to assign this Agreement or delegate any of its rights, interests,
duties or obligations hereunder. On and after the date Shire has paid
Manufacturer the full amount of the Milestone Payments, Principal shall have the
right to assign this Agreement or delegate any of its rights, interests, duties
or obligations; provided, that (a) Principal shall give written notice of such
assignment or delegation to Manufacturer, and (b) the assignee or delegatee
shall confirm in writing to and for the benefit of Manufacturer that it will
comply with the covenants and agreements of Principal hereunder. Manufacturer
shall not have the right to assign this Agreement or delegate any of its rights,
interests duties or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
Principal, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time during the term of this Agreement either party may assign
this Agreement to any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of the
other parties; provided, that no such assignment of this Agreement shall relieve
the assignor of any of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party may assign this Agreement without the
other parties' prior written consent in connection with the transfer or sale of
all or substantially all of its assets

or business or its merger or consolidation with another Person upon written
notice to the other parties. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
Section 11.04 shall be void.

      Section 11.05. Binding Effect; Benefit. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer on any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

      Section 11.06. Amendments. This Agreement shall not be modified, amended
or supplemented except pursuant to an instrument in writing executed and

      Section 11.07. No Waiver. The failure in any one or more instances of a
party to insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement, to exercise any right or privilege conferred in this Agreement,
or the waiver by said party of any breach of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement, shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of
any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges, but the same shall
continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or waiver
had occurred. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by
an authorized representative of the waiving party.

      Section 11.08. Counterparts. This Agreement shall become binding when any
one or more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the
signatures of each of the parties hereto. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original as against the
party whose signature appears thereon, but all of which taken together shall
constitute but one and the same instrument. Each party may execute this
Agreement on a facsimile of the Agreement. In addition, facsimile signatures of
authorized signatories of any party shall be valid and binding and delivery of a
facsimile signature by any party shall constitute due execution and delivery of
this Agreement.

      Section 11.09. Interpretation. The article and section headings contained
in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, any
reference to the masculine, feminine or neuter gender shall include all genders,

causes of action relating to or arising out of this Agreement shall be construed
in accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.

      Section 11.11. Unenforceability. If any provisions of this Agreement are
determined to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provisions
shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability in
such jurisdiction, without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of such
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. The parties will use
their best efforts to substitute the invalid or unenforceable provision with a
valid and enforceable one which conforms, as nearly as possible, with the
original intent of the parties.
