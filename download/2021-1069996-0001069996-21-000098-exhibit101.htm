Notwithstanding anything stated herein, this Contract shall not apply to any loss in excess  of policy limits or any extra contractual obligation incurred by the Company as a result of  any fraudulent and/or criminal act by any officer or director of the Company acting  individually or collectively or in collusion with any individual or corporation or any other  organization or party involved in the presentation, defense or settlement of any claim  covered hereunder.

The term &quot;loss occurrence&quot; shall mean the sum of all individual losses directly occasioned  by any one disaster, accident or loss or series of disasters, accidents or losses arising out  of one event which occurs within the area of one state of the United States or province of  Canada and states or provinces contiguous thereto and to one another.

As regards storm or storm systems that are not a named storm, including, by way of  example and not limitation, ensuing wind, gusts, typhoon, tropical storm, hail, rain,  tornados, cyclones, ensuing flood, storm surge, fire following, sprinkler leakage, riots,  vandalism, collapse and water damage, all individual losses sustained by the  Company occurring during any period of 144 consecutive hours arising out of, caused  by, occurring during, occasioned by or resulting from the same event.  However, the  event need not be limited to one state or province or states or provinces contiguous  thereto.     3. As regards riot, riot attending a strike, civil commotion, vandalism and malicious  mischief, all individual losses sustained by the Company occurring during any period  of 96 consecutive hours within the area of one municipality or county and the  municipalities or counties contiguous thereto arising out of and directly occasioned by  the same event.

As regards earthquake (the epicenter of which need not necessarily be within the  territorial confines referred to in the introductory portion of this paragraph) and fire  following directly occasioned by the earthquake, only those individual fire losses which  commence during the period of 168 consecutive hours may be included in the  Company's loss occurrence.     5. As regards freeze, only individual losses directly occasioned by collapse, breakage of  glass and water damage (caused by bursting frozen pipes and tanks) may be included  in the Company's loss occurrence.     6.

Furthermore:     1. For all loss occurrences other than those referred to in subparagraphs A.1., A.2., and  A.3. above, only one such period of 168 consecutive hours shall apply with respect to  one event.    </FONT></DIV>

As regards those loss occurrences referred to in subparagraph A.2., only one such  period of consecutive hours (as set forth therein) shall apply with respect to one event,  regardless of the duration of the event.       3. As regards those loss occurrences referred to in subparagraphs A.1 and A.3. above, if  the disaster, accident, or loss or series of disasters, accidents, or losses occasioned  by the event is of greater duration than one period of consecutive hours (as set forth  therein), then the Company may divide that disaster, accident, or loss or series of  disasters, accidents, or losses into two or more loss occurrences, provided that no two  periods overlap and no individual loss is included in more than one such period.    C. It is understood that losses arising from a combination of two or more perils as a result of  the same event may be considered as having arisen from one loss occurrence.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the hourly limitations as stated above shall not be exceeded  as respects the applicable perils, and no single loss occurrence shall encompass a time  period greater than 168 consecutive hours, except as regards those loss occurrences  referred to in subparagraphs A.1., A.4. and A.6. above.      Article 10 - Loss Notices and Settlements  A. Whenever losses sustained by the Company are reserved by the Company for an amount  greater than 50.0% of the Company's respective retention under any excess layer  hereunder and/or appear likely to result in a claim under such excess layer, the Company  shall notify the Subscribing Reinsurers under that excess layer and shall provide updates  related to development of such losses.  The Reinsurer shall have the right to participate in  the adjustment of such losses at its own expense.    B. All loss settlements made by the Company, provided they are within the terms of this  Contract and the terms of the original policy (with the exception of loss in excess of policy  limits or extra contractual obligations coverage, if any, under this Contract), shall be binding  upon the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer agrees to pay all amounts for which it may be liable  upon receipt of reasonable evidence of the amount paid by the Company.      Article 11 - Salvage and Subrogation  The Reinsurer shall be credited with salvage (i.e., reimbursement obtained or recovery made by  the Company, less the actual cost, excluding salaries of officials and employees of the  Company and sums paid to attorneys as retainer, of obtaining such reimbursement or making  such recovery) on account of claims and settlements involving reinsurance hereunder.  Salvage  thereon shall always be used to reimburse the excess carriers in the reverse order of their  priority according to their participation before being used in any way to reimburse the Company  for its primary loss.  The Company hereby agrees to enforce its rights to salvage or subrogation  relating to any loss, a part of which loss was sustained by the Reinsurer, and to prosecute all  claims arising out of such rights, if, in the Company's opinion, it is economically reasonable to  do so.      </FONT></DIV>

The  provisions of this Article shall not be affected by the insolvency of either party.      Article 15 - Severability of Interests and Obligations  The rights, duties and obligations set forth below shall apply as if this Contract were a separate  contract between the Subscribing Reinsurers and each named reinsured company:     A. Balances payable by any Subscribing Reinsurer to or from any reinsured party under the  Contract shall not serve to offset any balances recoverable to, or from, any other reinsured  party to the Contract and balances payable shall be separated by named reinsured  company and paid directly to the appropriate named reinsured company's bank account.    B.

It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver,  conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the  Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the policy or bond  reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a  reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in  the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate  such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be  adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its  liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor.  The expense thus incurred by the  Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company  as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the  benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by  the Reinsurer.

As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, in the event of any dispute or  difference of opinion hereafter arising with respect to this Contract, it is hereby mutually  agreed that such dispute or difference of opinion shall be submitted to arbitration.  One  Arbiter shall be chosen by the Company, the other by the Reinsurer, and an Umpire shall  be chosen by the two Arbiters before they enter upon arbitration, all of whom shall be active  or retired disinterested executive officers of insurance or reinsurance companies or Lloyd's  London Underwriters.  In the event that either party should fail to choose an Arbiter within  30 days following a written request by the other party to do so, the requesting party may  choose two Arbiters who shall in turn choose an Umpire before entering upon arbitration.  If  the two Arbiters fail to agree upon the selection of an Umpire within 30 days following their  appointment, each Arbiter shall nominate three candidates within 10 days thereafter, two of  whom the other shall decline, and the decision shall be made by drawing lots.    </FONT></DIV>

Nothing in this Article constitutes or  should be understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurer's rights to commence an  action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a  United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by  the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States.

Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraph (1) of this Clause, this Reinsurance does not cover any loss  or liability accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer, from any insurance  against Physical Damage (including business interruption or consequential loss arising out of such Physical Damage)  to:     I.

However on and after 1st January 1960 this sub-paragraph (b)  shall only apply provided the said radioactive contamination exclusion provision has been approved by the  Governmental Authority having jurisdiction thereof.    4.

This subparagraph 1 shall not apply with  respect to:     a. Residual market mechanisms created by statute.  This Contract shall not extend,  however, to afford coverage for liability arising from the inability of any other  participant or member in the residual market mechanism to meet its obligations,  nor shall this Contract extend to afford coverage for liability arising from any  claim against the residual market mechanism brought by or on behalf of any  insolvency fund (as defined in the Insolvency Fund Exclusion Clause  incorporated in this Contract).
