Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances, in each case by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent, which shall give to each Appropriate Lender prompt notice
thereof by telex or telecopier. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF
BORROWING") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex or
telecopier, in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, specifying therein
the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Facility under which such
Borrowing is to be made, (iii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing (in
the case of a US Revolving Credit Borrowing), (iv) aggregate amount of such
Borrowing, (v) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, initial Interest Period for each such Advance and the currency of each
such Advance; provided, that for the first 2 weeks after the Initial Base Rate
Period, the Borrowers may only select Interest Periods of one week for any
Eurodollar Rate Advance and (vi) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of
Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances, the term of each such Advance.
Each Appropriate Lender shall, before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending
Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in
same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing in accordance
with the respective Commitments under the applicable Facility of such Lender and
the other Appropriate Lenders. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such
funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article
III, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the applicable
Borrower by crediting the Borrower's Account; provided, however, that in the
case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall first
make (x) a portion of such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of any
Canadian Revolving Credit Advances made by any Canadian Lender or any Canadian
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and by any other Revolving Credit Lender and
outstanding on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, plus interest
accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of such date, available to such Canadian
Lender or such Canadian Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and such other
Revolving Credit Lenders for repayment of such Canadian Revolving Credit
Advances and Canadian Letter of Credit Advances, (y) a portion of such funds
equal to the aggregate principal amount of any US Letter of Credit Advances and
any Swing Line Advances made by any Swing Line Bank or any US Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, and by any other US Revolving Lender and outstanding on the
date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid
thereon to and as of such date, available to such Swing Line Bank or US Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, and such

                                       50

other Revolving Credit Lenders for repayment of such US Letter of Credit
Advances and Swing Line Advances and (z) a portion of such funds equal to the
Face Amount of any Bankers' Acceptance and any outstanding Notional Bankers'
Acceptance made by any Lender outstanding on the date of such Revolving Credit
Borrowing shall be deposited in the BA Collateral Account, and will be made
available to such Lenders for repayment of outstanding Bankers' Acceptances and
BA Equivalent Advances, as the case may be, upon the final maturity of such
Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances.

                  (b)      Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made on notice,
given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed
Swing Line Borrowing, by the applicable Borrower to any Swing Line Bank and the
Administrative Agent. Each such notice of a Swing Line Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF
SWING LINE BORROWING") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing,
or telex or telecopier, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such
Borrowing, (ii) amount of such Borrowing and (iii) maturity of such Borrowing
(which maturity shall be no later than the seventh day after the requested date
of such Borrowing). If, in its sole discretion, such Swing Line Bank elects to
make the requested Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Bank will make the amount
thereof available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
Account, in same day funds. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such
funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article
III, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the applicable
Borrower by crediting such Borrower's Account. Upon written demand by any Swing
Line Bank with an outstanding Swing Line Advance, with a copy of such demand to
the Administrative Agent, each other Revolving Lender shall purchase from such
Swing Line Bank, and such Swing Line Bank shall sell and assign to each such
other Revolving Lender, such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such outstanding
Swing Line Advance as of the date of such demand, by making available for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Swing Line Bank, by deposit to the Administrative Agent's
Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding
principal amount of such Swing Line Advance to be purchased by such Lender. Each
Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Revolving Credit
Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Swing Line
Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by the Swing
Line Bank that made such Advance; provided, that notice of such demand is given
not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day or (ii) the
first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given
after such time. Upon any such assignment by a Swing Line Bank to any other
Revolving Credit Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line
Bank represents and warrants to such other Lender that such Swing Line Bank is
the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes
no other representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect
to such Swing Line Advance, the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the
extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have so made the amount of
such Swing Line Advance available to the Administrative Agent, such Revolving
Credit Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by
such Swing Line Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent such amount for the account of such Swing Line Bank on any Business Day,
such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line
Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement,
and the outstanding principal amount of the Swing

<PAGE>

                                       51

Line Advance made by such Swing Line Bank shall be reduced by such amount on
such Business Day.

                  (c)      Upon written demand by any Canadian Lender, with a
copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each other Revolving Credit
Lender (or any of its Canadian Affiliates) shall (i) purchase from such Canadian
Lender, and such Canadian Lender shall sell to each such other Revolving Credit
Lender (or such Affiliate) and assign such Canadian Lender's Pro Rata Share of
Canadian Revolving Credit Advances (other than Bankers' Acceptances and BA
Equivalent Advances) and (ii) purchase from such Canadian Lender a participation
in any Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances, as the case may be,
outstanding as of the date of such demand, by making available for the account
of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Canadian Lender, by deposit to the Administrative Agent's Account, in same
day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount
(or Face Amount, in the case of Bankers' Acceptances and Notional Bankers'
Acceptances) of such Canadian Revolving Credit Advances to be purchased by
assignment or participation, as the case may be, by such Lender (or such
Affiliate). Each Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale, assignment and
participation. Each Revolving Credit Lender agrees to purchase (or cause one of
its Canadian Affiliates to purchase) its Pro Rata Share of outstanding Canadian
Revolving Credit Advances (including, without limitation, outstanding Bankers'
Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances) on (i) the Business Day on which
demand therefor is made by the Canadian Lenders that made such Advances;
provided, that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New
York City time) on such Business Day or (ii) the first Business Day next
succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. Upon
any such assignment by a Canadian Lender to any other Revolving Credit Lender
(or any of its Canadian Affiliates) of a portion of a Canadian Revolving Credit
Advance, such Canadian Lender (or such Affiliate) represents and warrants to
such other Lender that such Canadian Lender is the legal and beneficial owner of
such interest being assigned by it, but makes no other representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such Canadian Revolving
Credit Advance, the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the extent that
any Revolving Credit Lender (or any of its Canadian Affiliates) shall not have
so made the amount of such Canadian Revolving Credit Advance available to the
Administrative Agent, such Revolving Credit Lender agrees to pay (or cause one
of its Canadian Affiliates to pay) to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of
demand by such Canadian Lender until the date such amount is paid to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender (or any of its
Canadian Affiliates) shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the
account of such Canadian Lenders on any Business Day, such amount so paid in
respect of principal (or Face Amount) shall constitute a Canadian Revolving
Credit Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this
Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Canadian Revolving Credit
Advance made by such Canadian Lender shall be reduced by such amount on such
Business Day.

                  (d)      Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) no Borrower may select Eurodollar Rate Advances for the
initial Borrowing hereunder and for the period from the date hereof to the date
that is 15 Business Days following the Escrow Release Date (or such earlier date
as shall be specified in its sole discretion by the Administrative Agent in a
written notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders) (the "INITIAL BASE RATE
PERIOD") or for any

<PAGE>

                                       52

Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than US$5,000,000 or
if the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.11 and (ii) the Term B
Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than 8 separate Borrowings and
the Revolving Credit Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than 10
separate Borrowings.

                  (e)      Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Swing Ling
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the applicable Borrower. In the
case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be
comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the applicable Borrower shall indemnify
each Appropriate Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such
Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in
such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth
in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the
Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance,
as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

                  (f)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from an Appropriate Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing under a
Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not
have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such
Lender and each Borrower severally agree to repay or pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount and to pay interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is made available to the applicable
Borrower until the date such amount is repaid or paid to the Administrative
Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at such
time under Section 2.08 to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the
case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall
constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for all purposes.

                  (g)      The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be
made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing,
but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.03. Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters
of Credit. (a) Request for Issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon
notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the fifth
Business Day prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of
Credit, by the US Borrower to any US Revolving Issuing Bank or any Additional
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, or by a Canadian Borrower to any Canadian
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, which shall give to the Administrative Agent
and each US Revolving

<PAGE>

                                       53

Credit Lender, in the case of a US Revolving Letter of Credit or each Canadian
Revolving Credit Lender in the case of a Canadian Letter of Credit, prompt
notice thereof by telecopier or electronic communication and such requirement
shall be deemed waived if such notice is accepted by the Administrative Agent
and the applicable Issuing Bank and received earlier than five days prior to the
date of proposed issuance. Each such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a
"NOTICE OF ISSUANCE") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing,
or telecopier electronic communication, specifying therein the requested (A)
date of such issuance (which shall be a Business Day or a Canadian Business Day,
as applicable), (B) Available Amount and currency (which shall be US Dollars, in
the case of a US Revolving Letter of Credit or an Additional Letter of Credit or
Canadian Dollars, in the case of a Canadian Letter of Credit) of such Letter of
Credit, (C) expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (D) name and address of
the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (E) form of such Letter of Credit,
and shall be accompanied by such application and agreement for letter of credit
as such Issuing Bank may specify to such Borrower for use in connection with
such requested Letter of Credit (a "LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT"). If (x) the
requested form of such Letter of Credit is acceptable to such Issuing Bank in
its sole discretion and (y) (other than in the case of Additional Letters of
Credit) it has not received notice of objection to such issuance from Lenders
holding at least a majority of the Revolving Credit Commitments, such Issuing
Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article
III, make such Letter of Credit available to such Borrower at its office
referred to in Section 8.02 or as otherwise agreed with such Borrower in
connection with such issuance. In the event and to the extent that the
provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement,
the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.

                  (b)      Letter of Credit Reports. Each Issuing Bank shall
furnish (A) to the Administrative Agent on the first Business Day of each week a
written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit
issued by such Issuing Bank during the previous week and drawings during such
week under all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, (B) to each
Revolving Credit Lender on the first Business Day of each month a written report
summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank during the preceding month and drawings during such month under all
Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and (C) to the Administrative
Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender on the first Business Day of each
calendar quarter a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate
Available Amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit
issued by such Issuing Bank.

                  (c)      Participations in Letters of Credit. Upon the
issuance of a Revolving Letter of Credit by any Revolving Issuing Bank under
Section 2.03(a), such Revolving Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further
action by any party hereto, to have sold to each Revolving Credit Lender, in the
case of a Canadian Letter of Credit, or each US Revolving Credit Lender, in the
case of a US Revolving Letter of Credit, and each such Revolving Credit Lender
shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have purchased
from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount
for each Revolving Credit Lender equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Available Amount of such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such
Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each
Revolving Credit Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay (or,
in the case of a Canadian Letter of Credit, to cause one of its Canadian
Affiliates to pay) such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each L/C Disbursement made by
such Revolving Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by

<PAGE>

                                       54

the applicable Borrower forthwith on the date due as provided in Section 2.04(e)
by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank by deposit to the
Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such L/C Disbursement. Each Revolving Credit Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this Section 2.03(c) in respect of Revolving Letters of Credit is absolute
and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or
the termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made
without any off-set, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. If and to
the extent that any Revolving Credit Lender (or, in the case of a Canadian
Letter of Credit, any of its Canadian Affiliates) shall not have so made the
amount of such L/C Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent, such
Revolving Credit Lender agrees to pay (or, in the case of a Canadian Letter of
credit, to cause one of its Canadian Affiliates to pay) to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each
day from the date such L/C Disbursement is due pursuant to Section 2.04(e) until
the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds
Rate for its account or the account of such Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such
Lender (or, in the case of a Canadian Letter of Credit, any of its Canadian
Affiliates) shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the account of
such Revolving Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect
of principal shall constitute a Letter of Credit Advance made by such Lender on
such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal
amount of the Letter of Credit Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be
reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

                  (d)      Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by any Issuing
Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit (other than any Additional
Letter of Credit) shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement the making
by such Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit Advance, which shall be a Base Rate
Advance, in the case of a Letter of Credit Advance made by a US Revolving
Issuing Bank or a Canadian Advance, in the case of a Letter of Credit Advance
made by a Canadian Issuing Bank, in each case in the amount of such draft.

                  (e)      Failure to Make Letter of Credit Advances. The
failure of any Lender to make the Letter of Credit Advance to be made by it on
the date specified in Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation hereunder to make its Letter of Credit Advance on such date, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Letter of Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.

                  (f)      Additional Letter of Credit Drawing. If any draft is
drawn under any Additional Letter of Credit, the Additional Issuing Bank shall
pay such draft by withdrawing the amount of such draft from the Additional
Collateral Account.

         SECTION 2.04. Repayment of Advances. (a) (i) Term B Advances. The US
Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the
Term B Lenders the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term B Advances
(other than the Incremental Term Advances) on the following dates in the amounts
indicated (which amounts shall be reduced as a result of the application of
prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Section 2.07):

Advances on the dates and amounts indicated in the Incremental Term Loan

Agreement, any Letter of Credit Agreement and any other agreement or instrument
relating to any Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such
Letter of Credit Agreement and such other agreement or instrument under all
circumstances, including, without limitation, the following circumstances (it
being understood that any such payment by any Borrower is without prejudice to,

         Document, any Letter of Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any
         other agreement or instrument relating thereto (all of the foregoing
         being, collectively, the "L/C RELATED DOCUMENTS");

                  (B)      any change in the time, manner or place of payment
         of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations of such
         Borrower in respect of any L/C Related Document or any other amendment
         or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C

                                       57

                  (D)      any statement or any other document presented under a
         Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;

                  (E)      payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
         against presentation of a draft, certificate or other document that

         defense available to, or a discharge of, such Borrower or a guarantor.

         SECTION 2.05. Incremental Term Loan Commitments. (a) The US Borrower
may, at one time only during the term of the Term B Facility and prior to June
30, 2006, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, request Incremental
Term Commitments which shall have substantially similar terms to the Term B
Commitments (other than with respect to amortization and interest rate spread)
in an amount not to exceed the Incremental Term Amount from one or more
Incremental Term Lenders, which may include any existing Lender; provided, that
each Incremental Term Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be
subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld and, if withheld, the reason therefor shall be specified
in writing). Such notice shall set forth the amount of the Incremental Term
Commitments being requested (which shall be in a minimum amount of $50,000,000,
a maximum amount of $100,000,000 and in minimum increments of $1,000,000).

                  (b)      The US Borrower and each Incremental Term Lender
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Term Loan
Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent
shall reasonably specify to evidence the Incremental Term Commitment of such
Incremental Term Lender. Each Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement shall
specify the terms of the Incremental Term Advances to be made thereunder with
respect to interest rate spreads (the "INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN APPLICABLE
MARGIN"); provided, that, without the prior written consent of the Required
Lenders, (i) the final maturity date of any Incremental Term Advances shall be
no earlier than the Termination Date with respect to the Term B Facility and
(ii) the average life to maturity of any Incremental Term Advances shall be no
shorter than the average life to maturity of the loans under the Term B
Facility. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the
effectiveness of each Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental
Term Loan Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the
extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of
the Incremental Term Commitment evidenced thereby. Any such deemed amendment may
be memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent with the US Borrower's
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the other parties
hereto.

<PAGE>

                                       58

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any terms in the Incremental Term
Loan Assumption Agreement are more favorable to the Incremental Term Lenders
than the terms of the Term B Facility are to the Term B Lenders, the Term B
Facility shall be modified to include such more favorable terms to the extent
directed by the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term
Commitment shall become effective under this Section 2.05 unless (i) on the date
of such effectiveness, the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 shall be
satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that
effect dated such date and executed by the Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer or
Assistant Treasurer of the US Borrower, (ii) the Leverage Ratio as of the last
day of the preceding fiscal quarter would be less than the ratios required on
such date by at least a 0.25 to 1.00 ratio, as if the Incremental Term
Commitments requested were incurred as Incremental Term Advances on such date
(and any Debt to be repaid or Investments to be made with the proceeds thereof
were repaid or made on such date), and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have
received (with sufficient copies for each of the Incremental Term Lenders)
closing certificates and documentation reasonably specified by the
Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 2.06. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a)
Optional. The Borrowers may, upon at least five Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, terminate in whole or reduce in part (i) the unused
portions of the Term B Commitments, the Canadian Subfacility, the US Revolving
Letter of Credit Facility, the Additional Letter of Credit Facility or the
Canadian Letter of Credit Facility and (ii) the Unused Revolving Credit
Commitments; provided, however, that each partial reduction of a Facility (i)
shall be in an aggregate amount of U.S. $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
U.S. $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, the Equivalent thereof in
Canadian Dollars) and (ii) shall be made ratably among the Appropriate Lenders
in accordance with their Commitments with respect to such Facility.

                  (b)      Mandatory. (i) From time to time upon each repayment
or prepayment of the Term B Advances, the aggregate Term B Commitments of the
Term B Lenders shall be automatically and permanently reduced, on a pro rata
basis, by an amount equal to the amount by which the aggregate Term B
Commitments immediately prior to such reduction exceed the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Term B Advances then outstanding (after giving effect to
any such repayment or prepayment thereof).

                  (ii)     The US Revolving Letter of Credit Facility shall be
permanently reduced from time to time on the date of each reduction in the US
Revolving Credit Facility by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the US
Revolving Letter of Credit Facility exceeds the US Revolving Credit Facility
after giving effect to such reduction of the US Revolving Credit Facility.

                  (iii)    The Canadian Letter of Credit Facility shall be
permanently reduced from time to time on the date of each reduction in the
Canadian Subfacility by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the Canadian
Letter of Credit Facility exceeds the Canadian Subfacility after giving effect
to such reduction of the Canadian Subfacility.

<PAGE>

                                       59

                  (iv)     The Canadian Subfacility shall be permanently reduced
from time to time on the date of each reduction in the Revolving Credit Facility
by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the Canadian Subfacility exceeds
the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to such reduction of the
Revolving Credit Facility.

                  (v)      The Swing Line Facility shall be permanently reduced
from time to time on the date of each reduction in the US Revolving Credit
Facility by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the Swing Line Facility
exceeds the US Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to such reduction
of the US Revolving Credit Facility.

                  (vi)     The Revolving Credit Facility shall be automatically
and permanently reduced, on a pro rata basis, on each date on which prepayment
thereof is required to be made pursuant to Section 2.07(b)(i) or (ii) in an
amount equal to the applicable Reduction Amount; provided, that each such
reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be made ratably among the
Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitments.

                  (c)      Additional Collateral Account. Upon any reduction in
whole or in part of the unused portion of the Additional Letter of Credit
Facility, the Administrative Agent shall withdraw an amount equal to such
reduction from the Additional Collateral Account and shall either (i) if the
Administrative Agent has received a certificate of the US Borrower certifying
that the US Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall use all or a portion of
the amounts on deposit in the Additional Collateral Account up to the amount of
such reduction as cash collateral for an obligation of the US Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries in lieu of having a Letter of Credit issued in respect of such
obligation, remit such amount specified in such certificate to the US Borrower
or (ii) otherwise apply such amount as set forth in Section 2.07(b)(viii).

         SECTION 2.07. Prepayments. (a) Optional. Any Borrower may, upon at
least one Business Day's notice in the case of Base Rate Advances, one Canadian
Business Day's notice in the case of Canadian Advances and three Business Days'
notice in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case to the
Administrative Agent by 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such day, stating the
proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such
notice is given such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of such Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or
ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment
on the aggregate principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each
partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of U.S. $5,000,000
or an integral multiple of U.S. $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the Equivalent
thereof in Canadian Dollars if applicable) and (y) if any prepayment of a
Eurodollar Rate Advance is made on a date other than the last day of an Interest
Period for such Advance, such Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant
to Section 8.04(c); provided, further that optional prepayments of outstanding
Bankers' Acceptances shall not be permitted hereunder. Each such prepayment of
any Term B Advances shall be applied to the installments thereof on a pro rata
basis.

                  (b)      Mandatory. (i) The US Borrower shall, on the 90th day
following the end of each Fiscal Year thereafter, prepay an aggregate principal
amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowings and deposit an

Fiscal Year, as applicable, if the Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such
Fiscal Year is greater than or equal to 2.25:1, (B) 50% of the amount of Excess
Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year, as applicable, if the Leverage Ratio as of the
last day of such Fiscal Year is less than 2.25:1 but greater than or equal to
1.50:1 and (C) which percentage shall be reduced to 0% of the amount of Excess
Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year, as applicable, if the Leverage Ratio as of the
last day of such Fiscal Year is less than 1.50:1. Each such prepayment shall be
applied first ratably to each of the Term B Facility and the Incremental Term
Facility, and to the installments of each such Facility on a pro rata basis and
second to the Revolving Credit Facility as set forth in clause (vii) below.

                  (ii)     The US Borrower shall, on the Prepayment Date in
respect of the transaction resulting in Net Cash Proceeds, prepay an aggregate

definition of Net Cash Proceeds, if the Leverage Ratio after giving effect to
such transaction would be greater than or equal to 1.50:1, 100% of such Net Cash
Proceeds or if the Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such transaction is
less than 1.50:1, 50% of such Net Cash Proceeds, (C) in the case of any

and (D) 100% of Extraordinary Receipts in excess of an aggregate amount equal to

principal amount of (x) the Canadian Advances, (y) the Canadian Letter of Credit
Advances and (z) the Face Amount of outstanding Bankers' Acceptances and

Canadian Letter of Credit by reference to the Equivalent thereof in US Dollars
on such Business Day).

                  (v)      The applicable Canadian Borrower shall, on each

Notional Bankers' Acceptances then outstanding, respectively; and, in the case
of prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility required pursuant to clause (i)
or (ii) above the amount remaining (if any) after the prepayment in full of the
Advances then outstanding and the 100% cash collateralization of the aggregate
Available Amount of Letters of Credit and 100% of the Face Amount of Bankers'
Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances then outstanding (the sum of such

Advances, cash collateralization amounts and remaining amount being referred to
herein as the "REDUCTION AMOUNT") may be retained by the Borrowers and the
Revolving Credit Facility shall be permanently reduced as set forth in Section
2.06(b)(vi). Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on
deposit in the L/C Collateral Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse
the relevant Issuing Bank or Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable. Upon
payment of any Bankers' Acceptance on its maturity or upon the maturity date of
a BA Equivalent Advance for which funds are on deposit in the BA Collateral

occurred and is continuing, (i) cash collateral shall be released to the
applicable Borrowers upon the termination or expiry of any Revolving Letter of
Credit, or the maturity of any Bankers' Acceptance or BA Equivalent Advance, as
the case may be, in an amount equal to the cash collateral pledged in respect of
such Revolving Letter of Credit, Bankers' Acceptance or BA Equivalent Advance,
as the case may be or (ii) if, because of a fluctuation in the currency in which
any such Revolving Letter of Credit, Bankers' Acceptance or BA Equivalent
Advance is denominated, amounts on deposit in the relevant cash collateral
account in respect of such Revolving Letter of Credit, Bankers' Acceptance or BA
Equivalent Advance exceed 100% of the Available Amount of such Revolving Letter
of Credit, or of the Face Amount of such Bankers' Acceptance or the applicable
Notional Bankers' Acceptance, as the case may be, the amount of such excess cash
collateral shall be released to the applicable Borrower.

                  (vii)    If the conditions to Section 3.02 hereof are not
satisfied prior to the Deadline Date, (x) the US Borrower shall make a
prepayment on the Deadline Date of the entire outstanding principal amount of
Term B Advances and the US Revolving Credit Advances and shall deposit in the US
L/C Collateral Account an amount equal to the aggregate of the Available Amount
of all US Letters of Credit outstanding and as of the Deadline Date (y) the
Canadian Borrowers shall make prepayments on the Deadline Date of the entire
outstanding principal amount of Canadian Advances and Canadian Letter of Credit
Advances, shall deposit in the BA Collateral Account an amount equal to the

                  (viii)   On any day on which the Additional Letter of Credit
Commitment is reduced in whole or in part and the circumstances described in
clause (i) of Section 2.06(c) do not apply, the US Borrower shall make a
prepayment in respect of the Term B Facility (for this purpose not including the
Incremental Term Facility) in an amount equal to such reduction and the
Administrative Agent shall withdraw an amount equal to such reduction from the
Additional Collateral Account and apply such funds to such prepayment. Such
prepayment shall be applied to the installments of the Term B Facility (for this
purpose not including the Incremental Term Facility) on a pro rata basis.

                  (ix)     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
2.07, no Canadian Borrower or Canadian Guarantor shall be liable for or required
to repay any Obligation of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents other than
those Obligations incurred under the Canadian Subfacility.

                  (x)      All prepayments under this subsection (b) shall be
made together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the
principal amount prepaid, together with any amounts owing pursuant to Section
8.04(c).

                  (c)      Notice of Interest Period and Interest Rate. Promptly
after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(a), a notice of
Conversion pursuant to Section 2.10 or a notice of selection of an Interest

otherwise be determined in a timely manner in accordance with the definition of
"BA Rate", the Administrative Agent shall forthwith notify the applicable
Canadian Borrower and the Canadian Lenders that such interest rate cannot be
determined for such Bankers' Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances, and
the obligation of the Canadian Lenders to make, or to renew, Bankers'
Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances shall be suspended until the

Canadian Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

         SECTION 2.09. Fees. (a) Commitment Fee. The US Borrower shall pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders a commitment fee, from
the date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective date
specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender
in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date, payable in arrears
on the date of the Initial Extension of Credit, thereafter quarterly on the last
day of each March, June, September and December, commencing June 30, 2003, and
on the Termination Date in respect of the applicable Facility, at the rate of
1/2 of 1% per annum on the sum of the average daily Unused Revolving Credit
Commitment of each Appropriate Lender plus, if such Lender is a US Revolving
Credit Lender, its Pro Rata Share of (i) the average daily outstanding Canadian
Revolving Credit Advances during such quarter and (ii) the average daily
outstanding Swing Line Advances during such quarter to the extent the Lenders
have not purchased their Pro Rata Share of such Swing Line Advances; provided,
however, that any commitment fee accrued with respect to any of the Commitments
of a Defaulting Lender during the period prior to the time such Lender became a
Defaulting Lender and unpaid at such time shall not be payable by the US
Borrower so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender except to the
extent that such commitment fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by the
US Borrower prior to such time; and provided, further that no commitment fee
shall accrue on any of the Commitments of a Defaulting Lender so long as such
Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender. It is understood and agreed that for
purposes of this Section 2.09(a) and (b) the Canadian Borrowers shall have no
liability in respect of fees payable by the US Borrower.

                  (b)      Letter of Credit Fees, Etc. (i) The US Borrower shall
pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender
a commission, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing June 30, 2003, and on the earliest to occur
of the full drawing, expiration, termination or cancellation of any Letter of
Credit and on the Termination Date in respect of the US Revolving Letter of
Credit Facility and in respect of the Canadian Letter of Credit Facility, on
such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the average daily aggregate Available Amount
during such quarter of

<PAGE>

                                       65

all Letters of Credit which are Revolving Letters of Credit outstanding from
time to time at the rate of at the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate
Advances under the US Revolving Credit Facility. Upon (x) the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Default under Section 6.01(a) or 6.01(f) the
Administrative Agent shall and (y) the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may and, upon the request of the
Required Lenders shall, increase the amount of commission payable by the US
Borrower under this clause (b)(i) by 2% per annum.

                  (ii)     The US Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank, for
its own account, an issuance fee for each Letter of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank in an amount equal to 0.25% of the Available Amount of such Letter
of Credit on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, payable on such date
and such other commissions, fronting fees, transfer fees and other fees and
charges in connection with the issuance or administration of each Letter of
Credit as such Borrower and such Issuing Bank shall agree.

                  (c)      Agents' Fees. Each Borrower shall pay to each Agent
for its own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between such
Borrower and such Agent.

                  (d)      Stamping Fees. Each Canadian Borrower shall, on the
date of each Drawing and on the date of each renewal of any outstanding Bankers'
Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances, pay to the Administrative Agent, in
Canadian Dollars, for the ratable account of the Canadian Lenders accepting
Drafts and purchasing Bankers' Acceptances or making BA Equivalent Advances, the
Stamping Fee with respect to such Bankers' Acceptances or corresponding BA
Equivalent Advances. Each Canadian Borrower irrevocably authorizes each such
Canadian Lender to deduct the Stamping Fee payable with respect to each Bankers'
Acceptance or Notional Bankers' Acceptances of such Canadian Lender from the
Drawing Purchase Price payable by such Canadian Lender in respect of such
Bankers' Acceptance or Notional Bankers' Acceptances in accordance with Section
2.18 and to apply such amount so withheld to the payment of such Stamping Fee
for the account of the applicable Canadian Borrower and, to the extent such
Stamping Fee is so withheld and legally permitted to be so applied, the
applicable Canadian Borrower's obligations under the preceding sentence in
respect of such Stamping Fee shall be satisfied.

         SECTION 2.10. Conversion of Advances. (a) Optional. (x) Any Borrower
may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent not later
than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date
of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08 and
2.11, Convert all or any portion of the Advances of one Type comprising the same
Borrowing into Advances of the other Type; provided, however, that any
Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made
only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances,
any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in
an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in Section 2.02(d), no
Conversion of any Advances shall result in more separate Borrowings than
permitted under Section 2.02(d) and each Conversion of Advances comprising part
of the same Borrowing under any Facility shall be made ratably among the
Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their Commitments under such Facility.
Each such notice of Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above,
specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted and
(iii) if such Conversion is into

<PAGE>

                                       66

Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for such
Advances. Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the
applicable Borrower; and (y) any Canadian Borrower may on any Business Day, upon
notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on a Business Day at least two Canadian Business Days prior to the
date of the proposed conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08
or 2.11, convert all or any portion of the Canadian Revolving Credit Advances
comprising part of the same Borrowing to Drawings in accordance with Section
2.18(a) hereof; provided, however, that any Conversion of Bankers' Acceptances
or BA Equivalent Advances shall be made in accordance with Section 2.19. Each
such notice of Conversion shall specify (A) the date of such Conversion, (B) the
Canadian Revolving Credit Advances to be Converted, (C) if less than all of the
Canadian Revolving Credit Advances comprising part of any Borrowing are to be
Converted, the aggregate amount of Canadian Revolving Credit Advances to be so
Converted and (D) the initial term to maturity of the Bankers' Acceptances or BA
Equivalent Advances (which shall comply with the definition of "Maturity Date"
in Section 1.01); provided, however, that, if the Administrative Agent
determines in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the applicable Canadian Borrower) that the Bankers' Acceptances or BA
Equivalent Advances cannot be Converted ratably by the Canadian Lenders, due
solely to the requested aggregate Face Amount thereof, the aggregate Face Amount
of Bankers' Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances to be created and
purchased by any Canadian Lender shall be reduced to such lesser amount as the
Administrative Agent determines will permit such Conversion to be so made and
each Canadian Lender shall make a Credit Advance in the amount of the difference
between such Canadian Lender's ratable portion of the original aggregate amount
of the Canadian Revolving Credit Advances to be Converted and the Face Amount of
the Bankers' Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances to be created by such
Canadian Lender after giving effect to such Conversion. Each notice of
Conversion under this Section 2.10 shall be irrevocable and binding on the
applicable Canadian Borrower.

                  To the extent of any inconsistency between the provisions of
this Section 2.10(a) and Section 2.19 as regards the conversion of Bankers'
Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances, the provisions of Section 2.19 shall
apply.

                  (b)      Mandatory. (i) On the date on which the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing
shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than
$5,000,000, such Advances shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                  (ii)     If any Borrower shall fail to select the duration of
any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Appropriate
Lenders, whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance.

                  (iii)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Default, (x) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of
the then existing Interest Period

<PAGE>

                                       67

therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (y) the obligation of the Lenders
to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended.

         SECTION 2.11. Increased Costs, Etc. (a) If, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law),
there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make
or of making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances or of agreeing to
issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of Credit or of
agreeing to make or of making or maintaining Letter of Credit Advances or of
purchasing, accepting or maintaining Bankers' Acceptances or Notional Bankers'
Acceptances (excluding, for purposes of this Section 2.11, any such increased
costs resulting from (x) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.13 shall
govern) and (y) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or
overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or
state under the laws of which such Lender Party is organized or has its
Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the
Borrowers shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy
of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender Party additional amounts sufficient to compensate
such Lender Party for such increased cost.

                  (b)      If any Lender Party determines that compliance with
any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would
affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender Party or any corporation controlling such Lender Party and that the
amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such
Lender Party's commitment to lend, to accept, purchase, maintain loans, and/or
discount Banker's Acceptances or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit
hereunder and other commitments of such type or the issuance or maintenance of
or participation in the Letters of Credit (or similar contingent obligations),
then, upon demand by such Lender Party or such corporation (with a copy of such
demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party, from time to time as
specified by such Lender Party, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender Party in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender
Party reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the
existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend, to accept, purchase,
maintain loans, and/or discount Bankers' Acceptances or Notional Bankers'
Acceptances or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder or to the
issuance or maintenance of or participation in any Letters of Credit.

                  (c)      If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances
under any Facility, Lenders owed at least a majority of the then aggregate
unpaid principal amount thereof notify the Administrative Agent that the
Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately
reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their
Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent
shall forthwith so notify the Borrowers and the Appropriate Lenders, whereupon
(i) each such Eurodollar Rate Advance under such Facility will automatically, on
the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base
Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make, or to
Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the

<PAGE>

                                       68

Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers that such Lenders have
determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of
any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender
to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, (i) each Eurodollar Rate
Advance under each Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment will
automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the
obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into,
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall
notify the Borrowers that such Lender has determined that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that, before making
any such demand, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a
different Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a designation would
allow such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to continue to perform its
obligations to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Advances and would not, in the sole judgment of such Lender, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in the interpretation of any law
or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Canadian Lender or its BA
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to complete and accept
Drafts, to purchase Bankers' Acceptances or Notional Bankers' Acceptances or to
continue to fund or maintain Bankers' Acceptances or Notional Bankers'
Acceptances hereunder, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such
Canadian Lender to the applicable Canadian Borrower through the Administrative
Agent (i) an amount equal to the aggregate Face Amount of all Bankers'
Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances outstanding at such time shall,
upon such demand (which shall only be made if deemed necessary by the applicable
Canadian Lender to comply with applicable law), be deposited by the applicable
Canadian Borrower into the BA Collateral Account until the Maturity Date of each
such Bankers' Acceptance and Notional Bankers' Acceptance, (ii) upon the
Maturity Date of any Bankers' Acceptance or Notional Bankers' Acceptance in
respect of which any such deposit has been made, the Agent shall be, and hereby
is, authorized (without notice to or any further action by the applicable
Canadian Borrower) to apply, or to direct the Administrative Agent to apply,
such amount (or the applicable portion thereof) to the reimbursement of such
Bankers' Acceptance and (iii) the obligation of the Canadian Lenders to complete
and accept Drafts and purchase Bankers' Acceptances and Notional Bankers'
Acceptance shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Applicable Canadian Borrower that such Lender has determined that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

         SECTION 2.12. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrowers shall make
each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of
counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.16), not
later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in US Dollars to
the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's

<PAGE>

                                       69

Account in same day funds, with payments being received by the Administrative
Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause like funds
to be distributed (i) if such payment by the Borrowers is in respect of
principal, interest, commitment fees or any other Obligation then payable
hereunder and under the Notes to more than one Lender Party, to such Lender
Parties for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices ratably
in accordance with the amounts of such respective Obligations then payable to
such Lender Parties and (ii) if such payment by the Borrowers is in respect of
any Obligation then payable hereunder to one Lender Party, to such Lender Party
for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an
Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in
the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after the effective date of
such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments
hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the
Lender Party assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and
Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods
prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

                  (b)      The Borrowers hereby authorize each Lender Party and
each of its Affiliates, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender Party
is not made when due hereunder or, in the case of a Lender, under the Note held
by such Lender, to charge from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, against any or all of the Borrowers' accounts with such Lender Party or
such Affiliate any amount so due (it being understood that the accounts of the
Canadian Borrowers shall not be charged for amounts owing in respect of the
Obligations of the US Borrower).

                  (c)      All computations of interest based on the Base Rate
and the Canadian Prime Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the
basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of
interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees and
Letter of Credit commissions shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the
basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for
which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (d)      Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes
shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall
be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment or
letter of credit fee or commission, as the case may be; provided, however, that,
if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar
Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment
shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

                  (e)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any
Lender Party hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in
full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the

<PAGE>

                                       70

Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each such Lender Party on such due date an amount equal to the
amount then due such Lender Party. If and to the extent the applicable Borrower
shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each
such Lender Party shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
such amount distributed to such Lender Party together with interest thereon, for
each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender Party until the
date such Lender Party repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the
Federal Funds Rate.

                  (f)      Whenever any payment hereunder or in respect of
Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances shall be stated to be due on a
day other than a Canadian Business Day such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Canadian Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case
be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as the
case may be.

                  (g)      Whenever any payment received by the Administrative
Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to
pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Agents and the Lender Parties
under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date,
such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the
Agents and the Lender Parties in the following order of priority:

                  (i)      first, to the payment of all of the fees,
         indemnification payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable
         to the Agents (solely in their respective capacities as Agents) under
         or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on such
         date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
         fees, indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Agents
         on such date;

                  (ii)     second, to the payment of all of the fees,
         indemnification payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable
         to the Issuing Banks, Swing Line Bank and the Canadian Lenders (solely
         in their respective capacities as such) under or in respect of this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents on such date, ratably based upon
         the respective aggregate amounts of all such fees, indemnification
         payments, costs and expenses owing to the Issuing Banks and the
         Canadian Lenders on such date;

                  (iii)    third, to the payment of all of the indemnification
         payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable to the Lenders
         under Sections 8.04 hereof, Section 25 of the US Security Agreement and
         any similar section of any of the other Loan Documents on such date,
         ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
         indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Lenders on
         such date;

                  (iv)     fourth, to the payment of all of the amounts that are
         due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties
         under Sections 2.11 and 2.13 hereof on such date, ratably based upon
         the respective aggregate amounts thereof owing to the Administrative
         Agent and the Lender Parties on such date;

                  (v)      fifth, to the payment of all of the fees that are due
         and payable to the Lenders under Section 2.09(a) on such date, ratably
         based upon the respective aggregate Commitments of the Lenders under
         the Facilities on such date;

<PAGE>

                                       71

                  (vi)     sixth, to the payment of all of the accrued and
         unpaid interest on the Obligations of the Borrower under or in respect
         of the Loan Documents that is due and payable to the Administrative
         Agent and the Lender Parties under Section 2.08(b) on such date,
         ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
         interest owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on
         such date;

                  (vii)    seventh, to the payment of all of the accrued and
         unpaid interest on the Advances that is due and payable to the
         Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties under Section 2.08(a) on
         such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all
         such interest owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties
         on such date;

                  (viii)   eighth, to the payment of the principal amount of all
         of the outstanding Advances that is due and payable to the
         Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date, ratably based
         upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such principal owing to
         the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date; and

                  (ix)     ninth, to the payment of all other Obligations of the
         Loan Parties owing under or in respect of the Loan Documents that are
         due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
         Parties on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate
         amounts of all such Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and
         the other Secured Parties on such date.

If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of
the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances
for which the Loan Documents do not specify the Advances or the Facility to
which, or the manner in which, such funds are to be applied, the Administrative
Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each
of the Lender Parties in accordance with such Lender Party's Pro Rata Share of
the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances outstanding at
such time and (b) the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit
outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding
Advances or other Obligations then owing to such Lender Party, and, in the case
of the Term B Facility, for application to such principal repayment installments
thereof, as the Administrative Agent shall direct. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no payment made by any Canadian Borrower hereunder shall be applied
to satisfy the Obligations of the US Borrower hereunder.

         SECTION 2.13. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by any Loan Party to or
for the account of any Lender Party or any Agent hereunder or under the Notes or
in respect of any Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances or any other
Loan Document shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.12 or the applicable
provisions of such other Loan Document, if any, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in
the case of each Lender Party and each Agent, taxes that are imposed on its net
income by the United States or any state within the United States and taxes that
are imposed on its net income (and franchise taxes that are increased as a
result of the receipt of any interest payment under this Agreement) by the state
or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender Party or such Agent,
as the case may be, is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in
the case

<PAGE>

                                       72

of each Lender Party, taxes that are imposed on its net income (and franchise
taxes that are increased as a result of the receipt of any interest payment
under this Agreement) by the state or foreign jurisdiction of such Lender
Party's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes or in respect of
any Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances or any other Loan Document
being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, the term Taxes shall include (i) taxes imposed by the United States or
Canada in connection with the domestication of the US Borrower as a Delaware
corporation, and (ii) taxes imposed by Canada or any political subdivision
thereof that arise in any manner, directly or indirectly, in the event that the
domestication of the US Borrower as a Delaware corporation is not effective or
respected for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any Canadian provincial
equivalent. If any Loan Party shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from
or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note or in respect of
any Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances or any other Loan Document to
any Lender Party or any Agent, (i) the sum payable by the Borrowers shall be
increased as may be necessary so that after such Loan Party and the
Administrative Agent have made all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.13) such Lender Party
or such Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make
all such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law.

                  (b)      In addition, a Loan Party shall pay any present or
future stamp, documentary, excise, property, intangible, mortgage recording or
similar taxes, charges or levies that arise from any payment made by such Loan
Party hereunder or under any Notes or in respect of any Bankers' Acceptances or
BA Equivalent Advances or any other Loan Documents or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, performance under, or otherwise with respect to,
this Agreement, the Notes, the Mortgages or the other Loan Documents
(hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

                  (c)      The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender Party
and each Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Taxes and
Other Taxes, and for the full amount of taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by
any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.13, imposed on or paid
by such Lender Party or such Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from
the date such Lender Party or such Agent (as the case may be) makes written
demand therefor.

                  (d)      Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes
or Other Taxes, the appropriate Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative
Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified
copy of a receipt evidencing such payment, to the extent such a receipt is
issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e)      With respect to funds borrowed by the US Borrower,
each Lender Party (including any SPC under Section 8.07(k)), that is organized
under the laws of a jurisdiction

<PAGE>

                                       73

outside the United States shall, on or prior to the date of its execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of
the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender Party in the
case of each other Lender Party, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably
requested in writing by any Borrower (but only so long thereafter as such Lender
Party remains lawfully able to do so), provide each of the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN or
W-8ECI or other applicable form, as appropriate, or any successor or other form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender Party is
exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on
payments made by the US Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes or in
respect of any Bankers' Acceptances, BA Equivalent Advances or any other Loan
Document. If the forms provided by a Lender Party at the time such Lender Party
first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a United States interest
withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be
considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender Party provides the
appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding
tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods
governed by such forms; provided, however, that if, at the effective date of the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party becomes a party to
this Agreement, the Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under
subsection (a) of this Section 2.13 in respect of United States withholding tax
with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes
shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the
future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding
tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender Party assignee on such date.
If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the
disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax
payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or the related certificate described above, that the
applicable Lender Party reasonably considers to be confidential, such Lender
Party shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrower and shall not be
obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information. For
purposes of this Section 2.13(e), the terms "UNITED STATES" and "UNITED STATES
PERSON" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

                  (f)      For any period with respect to which a Lender Party
that is lending to the US Borrower has failed to provide the US Borrower with
the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in subsection (e)
above, which failure shall include for this purpose any material failure, at any
time such Lender Party remains a party to this Agreement, of the form,
certificate or other document to specify the correct rate of United States
withholding tax, to the extent such specification is required by such form,
certificate or other document (other than if such failure is due to a change in
law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring after the date
on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be
provided or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not
required under subsection (e) above), such Lender Party shall not be entitled
(during the period such failure exists) to the increase described in subsection
(a)(i) or the indemnification under subsection (c) of this Section 2.13 with
respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure;
provided, however, that should a Lender Party become subject to Taxes because of
its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder,
the Loan Parties shall take such steps as such Lender Party shall reasonably
request to assist such Lender Party to recover such

<PAGE>

                                       74

Taxes and such Lender Party shall be responsible for such Loan Parties'
reasonable out of pocket expenses.

         SECTION 2.14. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender Party shall
obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an
assignment pursuant to Section 9.07) (a) on account of Obligations due and
payable to such Lender Party hereunder and under the Notes, in respect of any
Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances and the other Loan Documents at
such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the
amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party and under any
Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances at such time to (ii) the
aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties
hereunder and under the Notes, under any Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent
Advances and the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of
the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the
Notes and under any Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances at such time
obtained by all the Lender Parties at such time or (b) on account of Obligations
owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender Party hereunder and under the
Notes, under any Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances and the other
Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Lender Party at
such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due and
payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes, under any Bankers'
Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances and the other Loan Documents at such
time) of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable)
to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes and under any Bankers'
Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances at such time obtained by all of the
Lender Parties at such time, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the
other Lender Parties such interests or participating interests in the
Obligations due and payable or owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender Party to share the excess payment
ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such
purchase from each other Lender Party shall be rescinded and such other Lender
Party shall repay to the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the
extent of such Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)
the purchase price paid to such Lender Party to (ii) the aggregate purchase
price paid to all Lender Parties) of such recovery together with an amount equal
to such Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the
amount of such other Lender Party's required repayment to (ii) the total amount
so recovered from the purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount
paid or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so
recovered; provided, further that, so long as the Obligations under the Loan
Documents shall not have been accelerated, any excess payment received by any
Appropriate Lender shall be shared on a pro rata basis only with other
Appropriate Lenders; provided, further, that to the extent any such excess
payment was received by such Lender Party due to an error of the Administrative
Agent, such Lender shall forward such excess payment back to the Administrative
Agent for proper disbursement. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so
purchasing an interest or participating interest from another Lender Party
pursuant to this Section 2.14 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect
to such interest or participating interest, as the case may be, as fully as if
such Lender Party were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of
such interest or participating interest, as the case may be.

                                       75

         SECTION 2.15. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances, the
Drawings under the Bankers' Acceptances and issuances of Letters of Credit shall
be available (and each Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds and
Letters of Credit) solely to finance the consummation of the Plan of
Reorganization and the Transaction, pay transaction fees and expenses, provide
working capital for each Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than any Excluded
Subsidiary) and for general corporate purposes.

         SECTION 2.16. Defaulting Lenders. (a) In the event that, at any one
time, (i) any Lender Party shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting
Lender shall owe a Defaulted Advance to any Borrower and (iii) such Borrower
shall be required to make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document
to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then such Borrower may, so long
as no Default shall occur or be continuing at such time and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, set off and otherwise apply the Obligation
of such Borrower to make such payment to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender against the obligation of such Defaulting Lender to make such Defaulted
Advance. In the event that, on any date, such Borrower shall so set off and
otherwise apply its obligation to make any such payment against the obligation
of such Defaulting Lender to make any such Defaulted Advance on or prior to such
date, the amount so set off and otherwise applied by such Borrower shall
constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents an
Advance by such Defaulting Lender made on the date of such setoff under the
Facility pursuant to which such Defaulted Advance was originally required to
have been made pursuant to Section 2.01. Such Advance shall be considered, for
all purposes of this Agreement, to comprise part of the Borrowing in connection
with which such Defaulted Advance was originally required to have been made
pursuant to Section 2.01, even if the other Advances comprising such Borrowing
shall be Eurodollar Rate Advances on the date such Advance is deemed to be made
pursuant to this subsection (a). The applicable Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent at any time such Borrower exercises its right of set-off
pursuant to this subsection (a) and shall set forth in such notice (A) the name
of the Defaulting Lender and the Defaulted Advance required to be made by such
Defaulting Lender and (B) the amount set off and otherwise applied in respect of
such Defaulted Advance pursuant to this subsection (a). Any portion of such
payment otherwise required to be made by such Borrower to or for the account of
such Defaulting Lender which is paid by such Borrower, after giving effect to
the amount set off and otherwise applied by such Borrower pursuant to this
subsection (a), shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as specified in
subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 2.16.

                  (b)      In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender
Party shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a
Defaulted Amount to any Agent or any of the other Lender Parties and (iii) any
Borrower shall make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the
Administrative Agent may, on its behalf or on behalf of such other Agents or
such other Lender Parties and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
apply at such time the amount so paid by such Borrower to or for the account of
such Defaulting Lender to the payment of each such Defaulted Amount to the
extent required to pay such Defaulted Amount. In the event that the
Administrative Agent shall so apply any such amount to the payment of any such
Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount so applied by the

<PAGE>

                                       76

Administrative Agent shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents payment, to such extent, of such Defaulted Amount on such
date. Any such amount so applied by the Administrative Agent shall be retained
by the Administrative Agent or distributed by the Administrative Agent to such
other Agents or such other Lender Parties, ratably in accordance with the
respective portions of such Defaulted Amounts payable at such time to the
Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other Lender Parties and, if
the amount of such payment made by such Borrower shall at such time be
insufficient to pay all Defaulted Amounts owing at such time to the
Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other Lender Parties, in the
following order of priority:

                  (i)      first, to the Agents for any Defaulted Amounts then
         owing to them, in their capacities as such, ratably in accordance with
         such respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to the Agents;

                  (ii)     second, to the Issuing Banks, the Swing Line Banks
         and the Canadian Lenders for any Defaulted Amounts then owing to them,
         in their capacities as such, ratably in accordance with such respective
         Defaulted Amounts then owing to the Issuing Banks, the Swing Line Banks
         and the Canadian Lenders; and

                  (iii)    third, to any other Lender Parties for any Defaulted
         Amounts then owing to such other Lender Parties, ratably in accordance
         with such respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to such other Lender
         Parties.

Any portion of such amount paid by such Borrower for the account of such
Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (b), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (c) of this Section 2.16.

                  (c)      In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender
Party shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not owe a
Defaulted Advance or a Defaulted Amount and (iii) any Borrower, any Agent or any
other Lender Party shall be required to pay or distribute any amount hereunder
or under any other Loan Document to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender, then such Borrower or such Agent or such other Lender Party shall pay
such amount to the Administrative Agent to be held by the Administrative Agent,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in escrow or the
Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
hold in escrow such amount otherwise held by it. Any funds held by the
Administrative Agent in escrow under this subsection (c) shall be deposited by
the Administrative Agent in an account with a bank (the "ESCROW BANK") selected
by the Administrative Agent, in the name and under the control of the
Administrative Agent, but subject to the provisions of this subsection (c). The
terms applicable to such account, including the rate of interest payable with
respect to the credit balance of such account from time to time, shall be the
Escrow Bank's standard terms applicable to escrow accounts maintained with it.
Any interest credited to such account from time to time shall be held by the
Administrative Agent in escrow under, and applied by the Administrative Agent
from time to time in accordance with the provisions of, this subsection (c). The
Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
apply all funds so held in escrow from time to time to the extent necessary to
make any Advances required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and to pay any
amount payable by such Defaulting Lender hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party, as and when
such Advances or amounts are

<PAGE>

                                       77

required to be made or paid and, if the amount so held in escrow shall at any
time be insufficient to make and pay all such Advances and amounts required to
be made or paid at such time, in the following order of priority:

                  (i)      first, to the Agents for any amounts then due and
         payable by such Defaulting Lender to them hereunder, in their
         capacities as such, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts
         then due and payable to the Agents;

                  (ii)     second, to the Issuing Banks, the Swing Line Banks
         and the Canadian Lenders for any amounts then due and payable to them
         hereunder, in their capacities as such, by such Defaulting Lender,
         ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due and payable
         to the Issuing Banks, the Swing Line Banks and the Canadian Lenders;

                  (iii)    third, to any other Lender Parties for any amount
         then due and payable by such Defaulting Lender to such other Lender
         Parties hereunder, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts
         then due and payable to such other Lender Parties; and

                  (iv)     fourth, to such Borrower for any Advance then
         required to be made by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to a Commitment
         of such Defaulting Lender.

In the event that any Lender Party that is a Defaulting Lender shall, at any
time, cease to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds held by the Administrative
Agent in escrow at such time with respect to such Lender Party shall be
distributed by the Administrative Agent to such Lender Party and applied by such
Lender Party to the Obligations owing to such Lender Party at such time under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents ratably in accordance with the
respective amounts of such Obligations outstanding at such time.

                  (d)      The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender
under this Section 2.15 are in addition to other rights and remedies that such
Borrower may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted
Advance and that any Agent or any Lender Party may have against such Defaulting
Lender with respect to any Defaulted Amount.

         SECTION 2.17. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender Party shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing
to such Lender Party from time to time, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. Each
Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender Party to any Borrower (with a
copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) to the effect that a promissory
note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for
such Lender Party to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or
otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender Party, such
Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender Party, with a copy to
the Administrative Agent, a Revolving Credit Note and/or a Term B Note, as
applicable, in substantially the form of Exhibits A-1 and A-2 hereto,
respectively, payable to the order of such Lender Party in a principal amount
equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment and/or the Term B Commitment,
respectively, of such Lender Party. All references to Notes in the Loan
Documents shall mean Notes, if any, to the extent issued hereunder.

                                       78

                  (b)      The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 8.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary
account for each Lender Party, in which accounts (taken together) shall be
recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of
Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from such Borrower to each Lender Party
hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
from such Borrower hereunder and each Lender Party's share thereof.

                  (c)      Entries made in good faith by the Administrative
Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender Party
in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima
facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from such Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each
Lender Party and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender Party,
under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure
of the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party to make an entry, or any
finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of such Borrower under this
Agreement.

         SECTION 2.18. Drawings of Bankers' Acceptances and Notional Bankers'
Acceptances. (a) Request for Drawing. Each Drawing shall be made on notice,
given not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a Canadian Business Day
at least three Canadian Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Drawing,
by any Canadian Borrower to the Administrative Agent, which shall give each
Canadian Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier. Each notice of a Drawing (a
"NOTICE OF DRAWING") shall be in writing (including by telecopier), in
substantially the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto, specifying therein the requested
(i) date of such Drawing (which shall be a Canadian Business Day), (ii)
aggregate Face Amount of such Drawing and (iii) initial Maturity Date for each
Bankers' Acceptance and BA Equivalent Advances comprising part of such Drawing;
provided, however, that, if the Administrative Agent determines in good faith
(which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon such Canadian
Borrower) that the Drafts to be accepted and purchased as part of any Drawing
cannot, due solely to the requested aggregate Face Amount thereof, be accepted
and/or purchased ratably by the Canadian Lenders in accordance with Section
2.01(e), then the aggregate Face Amount of such Drawing (or the Face Amount of
Bankers' Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances to be created and
purchased by any Canadian Lender) shall be reduced to such lesser amount as the
Administrative Agent determines will permit such Drafts comprising part of such
Drawing to be so accepted and purchased and, unless such Canadian Borrower shall
have given written notice to the contrary to the Administrative Agent, each
Canadian Lender shall fund the difference between such Lender's ratable portion
of the original aggregate Face Amount of such Drawing and the Face Amount of the
Bankers' Acceptances to be created by such Lender after giving effect to such
reduction in the form of a Canadian Advance, which shall be deemed for all
purposes hereof to be a Canadian Advance made pursuant to Section 2.01(c). The
Administrative Agent agrees that it will, as promptly as practicable, notify
such Canadian Borrower of the unavailability of Bankers' Acceptances and, if
applicable, of the date and the amount of each Canadian Advance to be made or
actually made in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. Each Draft
in connection with any requested Drawing (A) shall be in a minimum amount of
CN$1,000,000

<PAGE>

                                       79

or an integral multiple of CN$100,000 in excess thereof, and (B) shall be dated
the date of the proposed Drawing. Each Canadian Lender that is a BA Lender
shall, before 1:00 P.M. (Toronto time) on the date of each Drawing, complete one
or more Drafts in accordance with the related Notice of Drawing, accept such
Drafts and purchase the Bankers' Acceptances created thereby for the Drawing
Purchase Price and shall, before 1:00 P.M. (Toronto time) on such date, make
available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative
Agent at its appropriate Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, the
Drawing Purchase Price payable by such Lender for such Drawing less the Stamping
Fee payable to such Lender with respect thereto under Section 2.09(d). Each
Non-BA Lender shall, in lieu of accepting its proportionate amount of Bankers
Acceptances forming part of a Drawing, make available to Borrower a loan (a "BA
EQUIVALENT ADVANCE") in Canadian Dollars in an amount equal to the Drawing
Purchase Price of the Bankers' Acceptances (which Bankers' Acceptances are
referred to herein collectively as the "NOTIONAL BANKERS' ACCEPTANCES") that
Non-BA Lender would have been required to accept if it were a BA Lender. Each
Non-BA Lender shall, before 1:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the date of each
Drawing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the
Administrative Agent at its appropriate Administrative Agent's Account, in same
day funds, the amount of the BA Equivalent Advance, less an amount equal to the
Stamping Fee that would have been applicable to the Notional Bankers' Acceptance
had it being a Bankers' Acceptance. In this Agreement, for the purposes of
calculating the outstanding amount of any BA Equivalent Advance, such
outstanding amount will be equal to the Face Amount of the Notional Bankers'
Acceptance that corresponds to such BA Equivalent Advance. Upon the fulfillment
of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Administrative Agent
will make the funds it has received from the Canadian Lenders available to such
Canadian Borrower by crediting the relevant Borrower's Account.

                  (b)      Limitations on Drawings. Anything in Section 2.18(a)
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Canadian Borrower may select a Drawing if
the obligation of the Canadian Lenders to purchase and accept Bankers'
Acceptances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.18(d) or 2.11.

                  (c)      Binding Effect of Notices of Drawing. Each Notice of
Drawing shall be irrevocable and binding on the applicable Canadian Borrower. In
the case of any proposed Drawing, the applicable Canadian Borrower shall
indemnify each Canadian Lender (absent any gross negligence by the Canadian
Lender) against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of
any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in the Notice of Drawing
for such Drawing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including,
without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender
to fund the Drawing Purchase Price (or in the case of Non-BA Lenders, the BA
Equivalent Advance) to be paid by such Lender as part of such Drawing when, as a
result of such failure, such Drawing is not made on such date (but, in any
event, excluding any loss of profit and the Stamping Fee applicable to such
Drawing or Advance).

                  (d)      Circumstances Making Bankers' Acceptances
Unavailable. (i) If, with respect to any proposed Drawing, the Administrative
Agent determines in good faith that circumstances affecting the money markets at
the time any related Notice of Drawing is delivered or is outstanding will
result in no market for the Bankers' Acceptances to be created in connection
with such Drawing or an insufficient demand for such Bankers' Acceptances to
allow

<PAGE>

                                       80

the Lenders creating such Bankers' Acceptances to sell or trade the Bankers'
Acceptances to be created and purchased or discounted by them hereunder in
connection with such Drawing, then, upon notice to the applicable Canadian
Borrower and the Canadian Lenders thereof, (A) the Notice of Drawing with
respect to such proposed Drawing shall be canceled and the Drawing requested
therein shall not be made and (B) the right of such Canadian Borrower to request
a Drawing shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify such
Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. In the
case of any such cancellation of a Notice of Drawing, unless such Canadian
Borrower shall give written notice to the contrary to the Administrative Agent,
the cancellation of any such Notice of Drawing shall be deemed to be the giving
by such Canadian Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing for Canadian Borrower
Advances consisting of Canadian Advances in an aggregate principal amount equal
to the aggregate Face Amount of such proposed Drawing and the Canadian Lenders
shall, subject to the terms and conditions hereof applicable to the making of
Canadian Advances, make such Advances available to such Canadian Borrower, if
practicable, on the same Business Day as the date of the requested Drawing, and
otherwise on the next Business Day. The Administrative Agent agrees that it
will, as promptly as practicable, notify such Canadian Borrower of the
unavailability of Bankers' Acceptances and, if applicable, of the date and the
amount of each Canadian Advance to be made or actually made in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

                  (ii)     Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Default, the obligation of the Canadian Lenders to create and purchase Bankers'
Acceptances shall be suspended.

                  (e)      Assumptions of the Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Canadian Lender prior to
the date of any Drawing that such Lender will not make available to it such
Lender's ratable share of the proceeds of such Drawing, in accordance with
Section 2.18(a), the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such ratable share available to it on the date of such Drawing in accordance
with Section 2.18(a) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the applicable Canadian Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that any such Lender shall not have
so made such ratable share available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender
and the Canadian Borrowers severally agree to repay or pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount, together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the
applicable Canadian Borrower until the date such amount is repaid or paid to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the applicable Canadian Borrower, a
rate per annum equal to the BA Rate used in calculating the Drawing Purchase
Price with respect to such Drawing, and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the
Canadian Interbank Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent
such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's
ratable share of the proceeds of such Drawing for all purposes under this
Agreement.

                  (f)      Presigned Draft Forms. To enable the Canadian Lenders
which are BA Lenders to create Bankers' Acceptances in accordance with Section
2.01(e) and this Section 2.18, the Canadian Borrowers shall supply each BA
Lender, upon the Canadian Borrowers' execution of this Agreement and from time
to time thereafter, with such number of Drafts provided to the Canadian
Borrowers by the Administrative Agent as the Administrative

<PAGE>

                                       81

Agent may from time to time reasonably request, duly endorsed and executed on
behalf of each Canadian Borrower by any one or more of its duly authorized
officers. Each BA Lender shall exercise such care in the custody and safekeeping
of any Drafts in its possession from time to time as it would exercise in the
custody and safekeeping of similar property owned by it. The signatures of
officers of the Canadian Borrowers on Drafts may be mechanically reproduced in
facsimile and Bankers' Acceptances bearing such facsimile signatures shall be
binding upon each Canadian Borrower as if they had been manually signed by such
officers. Notwithstanding that any of the individuals whose manual or facsimile
signature appears on any Draft as one of such officers may no longer hold office
at the date of such draft or at the date of its acceptance by a Lender hereunder
or at any time thereafter, any Draft or Bankers' Acceptance so signed shall be
valid and binding upon, and enforceable against, each Canadian Borrower. Each
Canadian Borrower hereby appoints each Canadian Lender holding a Draft with
respect to a Drawing made under this Agreement, as its attorney-in-fact to, from
time to time, complete such Draft to adequately reflect such Drawing made by
such Canadian Lender.

                  (g)      Distribution of Bankers' Acceptances. Bankers'
Acceptances purchased by a Canadian Lender in accordance with the terms of
Section 2.01(e) and this Section 2.18 may, in such Lender's sole discretion, be
held by such Lender for its own account until the applicable Maturity Date or
sold, rediscounted or otherwise disposed of by it at any time prior thereto in
any relevant market therefor.

                  (h)      Failure to Fund in Respect of Drawings. The failure
of any Canadian Lender to fund the Drawing Purchase Price to be funded by it as
part of any Drawing or to make a BA Equivalent Advance shall not relieve any
other Canadian Lender of its obligation hereunder to fund its Drawing Purchase
Price on the date of such Drawing or to make a BA Equivalent Advance, but no
Canadian Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Canadian
Lender to fund the Drawing Purchase Price or make the BA Equivalent Advance to
be funded or made, as the case may be by such other Canadian Lender on the date
of any Drawing.

         SECTION 2.19. Renewal and Conversion of Bankers' Acceptances. (a)
Optional Renewal. Any Canadian Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice
given to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time)
on a Business Day at least three Canadian Business Days prior to the date of the
proposed renewal and subject to the provisions of Section 2.11, renew all or any
portion of the Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances comprising part
of the same Drawing; provided, however, that:

                  (i)      any renewal of Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent
         Advances shall be made only on the then existing Maturity Date for such
         Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances;

                  (ii)     each renewal of Bankers' Acceptances and BA
         Equivalent Advances comprising part of the same Drawing shall be made
         ratably among the Lenders holding such Bankers' Acceptances and having
         made BA Equivalent Advances in accordance with the respective amount of
         such Bankers' Acceptances so held and BA Equivalent Advances so made;
         and

<PAGE>

                                       82

                  (iii)    upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
         Event of Default no renewal of any Bankers' Acceptance or BA Equivalent
         Advances may be made.

Each such notice of renewal shall, within the restrictions set forth above,
specify (A) the date of such renewal (which shall be the then existing Maturity
Date of such Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances and shall be a
Canadian Business Day), (B) the Bankers' Acceptances to be renewed, (C) if less
than all of the Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances comprising part
of any Drawing are to be renewed, the aggregate Face Amount for such renewal and
(D) the term to maturity of the renewed Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent
Advances (which shall comply with the definition of "Maturity Date" in Section
1.01); provided, however, that, if the Administrative Agent determines in good
faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon such Canadian
Borrower) that the Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances cannot, due
solely to the requested aggregate Face Amount thereof, be renewed ratably by the
Canadian Lenders, the aggregate Face Amount of such renewal (or the Face Amount
of Bankers' Acceptances or Notional Bankers' Acceptances to be created by any
Canadian Lender) shall be reduced to such lesser amount as the Administrative
Agent determines will permit such renewal to be so made and each Canadian Lender
shall fund the difference between such Canadian Lender's ratable portion of the
original aggregate Face Amount of such renewal and the Face Amount of the
Bankers' Acceptances or Notional Bankers' Acceptances to be created by such
Canadian Lender after giving effect to such reduction in the form of a Canadian
Advance, which shall be deemed for all purposes hereof to be a Canadian Advance
made pursuant to Section 2.01(c). Each notice of renewal under this Section 2.19
shall be irrevocable and binding on the applicable Canadian Borrower. Upon any
renewal of Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances comprising part of
any Drawing in accordance with this Section 2.19(a), the Canadian Lenders that
hold the Bankers' Acceptances and that made BA Equivalent Advances to be renewed
shall exchange such maturing Bankers' Acceptances for new Bankers' Acceptances
and shall make a new BA Equivalent Advances, containing the terms set forth in
the applicable notice of renewal, and the Drawing Purchase Price payable for
each such renewed Bankers' Acceptance and the proceeds of the new BA Equivalent
Advance shall be applied, together with other funds, if necessary, available to
the applicable Canadian Borrower, to reimburse the Bankers' Acceptances and BA
Equivalent Advances otherwise maturing on such date. Each Canadian Borrower
hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs each Canadian Lender to apply the
proceeds of each renewed Bankers' Acceptance or BA Equivalent Advance owing to
it to the reimbursement, in accordance with this Section 2.19(a), of the
Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances owing to such Canadian Lender and
maturing on such date.

                  (b)      Optional Conversion. Each Canadian Borrower may on
any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than
11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day at least two Canadian Business
Days prior to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions
of Section 2.19, Convert all or any portion of the Bankers' Acceptances or BA
Equivalent Advances comprising part of the same Drawing to a Canadian Revolving
Credit Borrowing comprised of Canadian Advances; provided, however, that:

<PAGE>

                                       83

                  (i)      any Conversion of Bankers' Acceptances and BA
         Equivalent Advances shall be made only on the then existing Maturity
         Date for such Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances;

                  (ii)     each Conversion of Bankers' Acceptances and BA
         Equivalent Advances comprising part of the same Drawing shall be made
         ratably among the Lenders that hold such Bankers' Acceptances and that
         made such BA Equivalent Advances in accordance with the respective
         amounts of such Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances so held
         and made; and

                  (iii)    no Conversion may be made if (A) the amount of the
         Advance to be made by any Canadian Lender in connection with such
         Conversion would exceed such Canadian Lender's unused portion of its
         Canadian Revolving Credit Commitment under the Canadian Subfacility in
         effect at the time of such Conversion, or (B) after giving effect to
         such Conversion, the sum of the aggregate principal amount of
         outstanding Canadian Advances plus the aggregate Face Amount of
         Bankers' Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances then outstanding
         in respect of outstanding BA Equivalent Advances then outstanding plus
         the aggregate Available Amount of all Canadian Letters of Credit
         outstanding at such time plus outstanding Canadian Letter of Credit
         Advances would exceed the Canadian Subfacility.

Each such notice of Conversion shall, within the restrictions set forth above,
specify (A) the date of such Conversion (which shall be the then existing
Maturity Date of such Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances and shall
be a Canadian Business Day), (B) the Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent
Advances to be Converted and (C) if less than all of the Bankers' Acceptances
and BA Equivalent Advances comprising part of any Drawing are to be Converted,
the aggregate Face Amount of such Conversion. Each notice of Conversion under
this Section 2.19 shall be irrevocable and binding on each Canadian Borrower.
Upon any Conversion of Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances
comprising part of the same Drawing in accordance with this Section 2.19(b), the
obligation of the Canadian Borrower to reimburse the Lenders under Section 2.12
in respect of the Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances otherwise
maturing on such date shall, to the extent of such conversion, be Converted to
an obligation to reimburse the Lenders making the Canadian Advances made in
respect of such maturing Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances on such
date ratably in accordance with the amount of the Advances held by such Lender
at the time of reimbursement. Each Canadian Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes and directs each Canadian Lender to apply the net proceeds of each
Canadian Advance made by such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19(b) to the
reimbursement of the Bankers' Acceptances or Notional Bankers' Acceptances owing
to such Lender and maturing on such date.

                  (c)      Mandatory Conversion. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Default and any or all renewals of any Bankers'
Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances are not appropriate, or if the Canadian
Borrower shall fail (i) to deliver a properly completed notice of renewal under
Section 2.19(a) or a properly completed notice of Conversion under Section
2.19(b) indicating its intention to renew or to Convert any maturing Bankers'
Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances or (ii) to reimburse the Canadian Lenders
for any Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances comprising part of the
same Drawing

                                       84

pursuant to Section 2.04, the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the
applicable Canadian Borrower and the Canadian Lenders, whereupon each such
Bankers' Acceptance and BA Equivalent Advances will automatically, on the then
existing Maturity Date of such Bankers' Acceptance or BA Equivalent Advances,
Convert into a Canadian Advance.

         Environmental Permits necessary for its operations and properties; and
         conduct, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to conduct, any
         investigation, study, sampling and testing, and undertake any cleanup,
         removal, remedial or other action necessary to remove and clean up all
         Hazardous Materials from any of its properties, to the extent required
         by Environmental Laws; provided, however, that neither the US Borrower
         nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to undertake any such
         cleanup, removal, remedial or other action to the extent that its
         obligation to do so is being contested in good faith and by proper
         proceedings, appropriate reserves are being maintained with respect to
         such circumstances and any such Hazardous Materials do not and could
         not reasonably be expected to pose an imminent and substantial
         endangerment to human health or the environment.

                  (d)      Maintenance of Insurance. Maintain, and cause each of
         its Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded Subsidiaries) to maintain,
         insurance including, without limitation, business interruption
         insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies or
         associations in such amounts and covering such risks as is usually
         carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar
         properties in the same general areas in which the US Borrower or such
         Subsidiary operates.

                  (e)      Preservation of Corporate Existence, Etc. Preserve
         and maintain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries (other than the
         Excluded Subsidiaries) to preserve and maintain, its existence, legal
         structure, legal name, rights (charter and statutory), permits,
         licenses, approvals, privileges and franchises; provided, however, that
         neither the US Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
         to preserve its existence or any right, permit, license, approval,
         privilege or franchise if the Board of Directors of the US Borrower or
         such Subsidiary shall determine that the preservation thereof is no
         longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the US Borrower or
         such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and that the loss thereof could
         not be reasonably likely, either individually or together with all
         other similar losses, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f)      Visitation Rights. At any reasonable time and from
         time to time, permit any of the Agents or any of the Lender Parties, or
         any agents or representatives thereof, to examine and make copies of
         and abstracts from the records and books of account of, and visit the
         properties of, the US Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries, and to
         discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the US Borrower and any
         of its Subsidiaries with any of their officers or directors and with
         their independent certified public accountants. References herein to
         "Subsidiaries" shall not be deemed to include the Excluded Subsidiaries
         except to the extent that the reason for any such request for
         visitation rights is related to potential liability of any Loan Party
         under the Pension Plans.

                  (g)      Keeping of Books. Keep, and cause each of its
         Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded Subsidiaries) to keep, proper
         books of record and account, in which full and correct entries shall be
         made of all financial transactions and the assets and business of the
         US Borrower and each such Subsidiary in accordance with United States
         generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time.

                  (h)      Maintenance of Properties, Etc. Maintain and
         preserve, and cause each of its Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded
         Subsidiaries) to maintain and preserve, all of its properties that are
         used or useful in the conduct of its business in good working order and
         condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted and will from time to time
         make or cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and
         replacements thereof except where failure to do so would not materially
         adversely affect the use of the related property.

                  (i)      Transactions with Affiliates. Conduct, and cause each
         of its Subsidiaries to conduct, all transactions otherwise permitted
         under the Loan Documents with any of their Affiliates on terms that are
         fair and reasonable and no less favorable to the US Borrower or such
         Subsidiary than it would obtain in a comparable arm's-length
         transaction with a Person not an Affiliate, other than transactions
         among Loan Parties.

                  (j)      Covenant to Guarantee Obligations and Give Security.
         Upon (x) the request of the Collateral Agent following the occurrence
         and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (y) the formation or
         acquisition of any new direct or indirect Subsidiaries (other than any
         Excluded Subsidiary) by any Loan Party or (z) the acquisition of any
         property by any Loan Party, and such property, in the judgment of the
         Collateral Agent, shall not already be subject to a perfected first
         priority security interest

                                      105

         in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured
         Parties, then in each case at the US Borrower's expense:

                           (i)      in connection with the formation or
                  acquisition of a Subsidiary that is not an insurance company,
                  within 10 days after such formation or acquisition, cause each
                  such Subsidiary, and cause each direct and indirect parent of
                  such Subsidiary (if it has not already done so), to duly
                  execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent a guaranty or
                  guaranty supplement, in form and substance satisfactory to the
                  Collateral Agent, guaranteeing the other Loan Parties'
                  obligations under the Loan Documents or, if a Canadian
                  Subsidiary, guaranteeing the Obligations of the Canadian Loan
                  Parties under the Loan Documents, provided, however, that
                  solely with respect to a guaranty or guaranty supplement to
                  secure the Obligations of the U.S. Loan Parties under the Loan
                  Documents, this clause (i) will not apply to any Subsidiary
                  that is (A) a CFC or (B) a Subsidiary that is held directly or
                  indirectly by a CFC.

                           (ii)     within 10 days after (A) such request
                  furnish to the Collateral Agent a description of the real and
                  personal properties of the Loan Parties and their respective
                  Subsidiaries in detail satisfactory to the Collateral Agent
                  and (B) such formation or acquisition, furnish to the
                  Collateral Agent a description of the real and personal
                  properties of such Subsidiary or the real and personal
                  properties so acquired, in each case in detail satisfactory to
                  the Collateral Agent,

                           (iii)    within 15 days after (A) such request or
                  acquisition of property by any Loan Party, duly execute and
                  deliver, and cause each Loan Party to duly execute and
                  deliver, to the Collateral Agent such additional mortgages,
                  pledges, assignments, security agreement supplements,
                  intellectual property security agreement supplements and other
                  security agreements as specified by, and in form and substance
                  satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, securing payment of all
                  the Obligations of such Loan Party under the Loan Documents
                  and constituting Liens on all such properties and (B) such
                  formation or acquisition of any new Subsidiary, duly execute
                  and deliver and cause each Subsidiary to duly execute and
                  deliver to the Collateral Agent mortgages, pledges,
                  assignments, security agreement supplements, intellectual
                  property security agreement supplements and other security
                  agreements as specified by, and in form and substance
                  satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, securing payment of all
                  of the obligations of such Subsidiary under the Loan
                  Documents; provided, however, that only for purposes of
                  securing the Obligations of the US Loan Parties under the Loan
                  Documents if such new property is Equity Interests in a CFC,
                  only 66% of such Equity Interests shall be pledged in favor of
                  the Secured Parties,

                           (iv)     within 30 days after such request, formation
                  or acquisition, take, and cause each Loan Party and each newly
                  acquired or newly formed Subsidiary to take, whatever action
                  (including, without limitation, the recording of mortgages,
                  the filing of Uniform Commercial Code and/or PPSA financing
                  statements, the giving of notices and the endorsement of
                  notices on title documents) may be necessary or advisable in
                  the opinion of the Collateral Agent

                                      106

                  to vest in the Collateral Agent (or in any representative of
                  the Collateral Agent designated by it) valid and subsisting
                  Liens on the properties purported to be subject to the
                  mortgages, pledges, assignments, security agreement
                  supplements, intellectual property security agreement
                  supplements and security agreements delivered pursuant to this
                  Section 5.01(j), enforceable against all third parties in
                  accordance with their terms; provided, however, that Liens
                  granted by a Subsidiary that is a CFC or a Subsidiary that is
                  held directly or indirectly by a CFC shall not secure the
                  Obligations of the U.S. Loan Parties under the Loan Documents,

                           (v)      within 60 days after such request, formation
                  or acquisition, deliver to the Collateral Agent, upon the
                  request of the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion, a
                  signed copy of a favorable opinion, addressed to the
                  Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, of counsel for
                  the Loan Parties acceptable to the Collateral Agent as to (1)
                  the matters contained in clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) above,
                  (2) such guaranties, guaranty supplements, mortgages, pledges,
                  assignments, security agreement supplements, intellectual
                  property security agreement supplements and security
                  agreements being legal, valid and binding obligations of each
                  Loan Party party thereto enforceable in accordance with their
                  terms, as to the matters contained in clause (iv) above, (3)
                  such recordings, filings, notices, endorsements and other
                  actions being sufficient to create valid perfected Liens on
                  such properties, and (4) such other matters as the Collateral
                  Agent may reasonably request,

                           (vi)     as promptly as practicable after such
                  request, formation or acquisition, deliver, upon the request
                  of the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion, to the
                  Collateral Agent with respect to each parcel of real property
                  owned or held by each Loan Party and each newly acquired or
                  newly formed Subsidiary that is not an insurance company,
                  title reports, surveys and engineering, soils and other
                  reports, and environmental assessment reports, each in scope,
                  form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent,
                  provided, however, that to the extent that any Loan Party or
                  any of its Subsidiaries shall have otherwise received any of
                  the foregoing items with respect to such real property, such
                  items shall, promptly after the receipt thereof, be delivered
                  to the Collateral Agent; provided, however, that Liens granted
                  by any Subsidiary that is a CFC or a Subsidiary that is held
                  directly or indirectly by a CFC shall not secure the
                  Obligations of the US Loan Parties under the Loan Documents,
                  and

                           (vii)    at any time and from time to time, cause
                  each Loan Party and each newly acquired or newly formed
                  Subsidiary that is not an insurance company to promptly
                  execute and deliver any and all further instruments and
                  documents and take, and cause each Loan Party and each newly
                  acquired or newly formed Subsidiary that is not an insurance
                  company to take, all such other action as the Collateral Agent
                  may deem necessary or desirable in obtaining the full benefits
                  of, or in perfecting and preserving the Liens of, such
                  guaranties, mortgages, pledges, assignments, security
                  agreement supplements, intellectual property security
                  agreement supplements and security agreements; provided,
                  however, that

<PAGE>

                                      107

                  Liens granted by any Subsidiary that is a CFC or a Subsidiary
                  that is held directly or indirectly by a CFC shall not secure
                  the Obligations of the US Loan Parties under the Loan
                  Documents.

                  (k)      Further Assurances. (i) Promptly upon request by any
         Agent, or any Lender Party through the Administrative Agent, correct,
         and cause each of its Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded
         Subsidiaries) promptly to correct, any material defect or error that
         may be discovered in any Loan Document or in the execution,
         acknowledgment, filing or recordation thereof, and

                  (ii)     Promptly upon request by any Agent, or any Lender
         Party through the Administrative Agent, do, execute, acknowledge,
         deliver, record, re-record, file, re-file, register and re-register any
         and all such further acts, deeds, conveyances, pledge agreements,
         mortgages, deeds of trust, trust deeds, assignments, financing
         statements and continuations thereof, termination statements, notices
         of assignment, transfers, certificates, assurances and other
         instruments as any Agent, or any Lender Party through the
         Administrative Agent, may reasonably require from time to time in order
         to (A) carry out more effectively the purposes of the Loan Documents,
         (B) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject any Loan
         Party's or any of its Subsidiaries' properties, assets, rights or
         interests to the Liens now or hereafter intended to be covered by any
         of the Collateral Documents, (C) perfect and maintain the validity,
         effectiveness and priority of any of the Collateral Documents and any
         of the Liens intended to be created thereunder and (D) assure, convey,
         grant, assign, transfer, preserve, protect and confirm more effectively
         unto the Secured Parties the rights granted or now or hereafter
         intended to be granted to the Secured Parties under any Loan Document
         or under any other instrument executed in connection with any Loan
         Document to which any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
         the Excluded Subsidiaries) is or is to be a party, and cause each of
         its Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded Subsidiaries) to do so.

                  (l)      Performance of Related Documents. Perform and
         observe, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to perform and observe, all
         of the terms and provisions of each Related Document to be performed or
         observed by it (including without limitation, the performance by any
         Excluded Subsidiary of its obligations under the PBGC Agreement),
         maintain each such Related Document in full force and effect, and
         enforce such Related Document in accordance with its terms, except in
         each case for any action that, if not taken, could not reasonably be
         likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (m)      Preparation of Environmental Reports. At the request
         of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent if the Lender
         Parties have a reasonable basis to believe that there has been a
         material release of Hazardous Materials at any property currently owned
         or operated by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, that any Loan
         Party or any of its Subsidiaries is in material non-compliance with any
         Environmental Law or Environmental Permit with respect to any property
         currently owned or operated by any Loan Party or any of its
         Subsidiaries, or that any property currently owned or operated by any
         Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to, or is threatened
         to be subject to, an Environmental Deed Restriction, provide to the
         Lender Parties within 60 days after such request, at the expense of the
         US Borrower, an

<PAGE>

                                      108

         environmental site assessment report for any of its or its
         Subsidiaries' properties described in such request, prepared by an
         environmental consulting firm reasonably acceptable to the
         Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, indicating the presence
         or absence of Hazardous Materials in violation of Environmental Law and
         the estimated cost of any compliance, removal or remedial action in
         connection with any Hazardous Materials in violation of Environmental
         Law on such properties; without limiting the generality of the
         foregoing, if the US Borrower fails to provide the report in the time
         referred to above, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may
         retain an environmental consulting firm to prepare such report, and the
         US Borrower hereby grants and agrees to cause any Subsidiary that owns
         any property described in such request to grant at the time of such
         request to the Agents, the Lender Parties, such firm and any agents or
         representatives thereof an irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject
         to the rights of tenants, to enter onto their respective properties to
         undertake such an assessment. References herein to "Subsidiaries" shall
         not be deemed to include the Excluded Subsidiaries.

                  (n)      Compliance with Terms of Leaseholds. Make all
         payments and otherwise perform all obligations in respect of all leases
         of real property to which the US Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
         (other than any Excluded Subsidiary) is a party, keep such leases in
         full force and effect and not allow such leases to lapse or be
         terminated or any rights to renew such leases to be forfeited or
         cancelled, notify the Administrative Agent of any default by any party
         with respect to such leases and cooperate with the Administrative Agent
         in all respects to cure any such default, and cause each of its
         Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded Subsidiaries) to do so, except,
         in any case, where the failure to do so, either individually or in the
         aggregate, could not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (o)      Cash Concentration Accounts. Except for accounts
         pledged in connection with the Bonding Facilities:

                           (i)      Maintain, and cause each of its US
                  Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded Subsidiaries) to
                  maintain, main cash concentration accounts with Citibank or
                  another institution satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
                  and lockbox accounts into which all proceeds of Collateral are
                  paid with one or more banks acceptable to the Collateral Agent
                  that have accepted the assignment of such accounts to the
                  Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties
                  pursuant to the Security Agreement.

                           (ii)     Maintain, and cause the Canadian Borrower
                  and the Canadian Subsidiaries to maintain, "mirror" cash
                  concentration accounts with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
                  or one or more banks acceptable to the Collateral Agent that
                  have accepted the assignment of such accounts to the

         shall prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made or
         confirmed; or

                  (c)      any Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any
         term, covenant or agreement contained in Section 2.15, 5.01(e), (f),

                  (d)      any Loan Party shall fail to perform or observe any
         other term, covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document on its
         part to be performed or observed if such failure shall remain
         unremedied for 30 days after the earlier of the date on which (i) a

         notice thereof shall have been given to the US Borrower by any Agent or
         any Lender Party; or

         Debt outstanding hereunder), when the same becomes due and payable
         (whether by scheduled maturity, required prepayment, acceleration,
         demand or otherwise), and such failure shall continue after the
         applicable grace period, if any, specified in the agreement or
         instrument relating to such Debt; or any other event shall occur or
         condition shall exist under any agreement or instrument relating to any
         such Debt and shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any,
         specified in such agreement or instrument, if the effect of such event
         or condition is to accelerate, or to permit the acceleration of, the
         maturity of such Debt or otherwise to cause, or to permit the holder
         thereof to cause, such Debt to mature; or any such Debt shall be
         declared to be due and payable or required to be prepaid or redeemed
         (other than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment or
         redemption), purchased or defeased, or an offer to prepay, redeem,
         purchase or defease such Debt shall be required to be made, in each
         case prior to the stated maturity thereof; or

         debts generally, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of
         creditors; or any proceeding shall be instituted or any step taken by

         insolvent, (ii) seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization,
         arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of it or
         its debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
         reorganization or relief of debtors, (iii) seeking the entry of an
         order for relief against it or any substantial part of its property,
         (iv) for the appointment of a receiver, trustee or other similar
         official for it or for any substantial part of its property or (v)
         seeking the seizure of or control over any substantial part of its
         property and, in the case of any such proceeding instituted against it
         (but not instituted by it) that is being diligently contested by it in
         good faith, either such proceeding shall remain undismissed or unstayed
         for a period of 45 days or any of the actions sought in such proceeding
         (including, without limitation, the entry of an order for relief
         against, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other
         similar official for, it or any substantial part of its property) shall

         than any Excluded Subsidiary) and either (i) enforcement proceedings
         shall have been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or order
         or (ii) there shall be any period of 30 consecutive days during which a
         stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of a pending
         appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect; provided, however, that
         any such judgment or order shall not give rise to an Event of Default
         under this Section 6.01(g) if and for so long as (A) the amount of such
         judgment or order is covered by a valid and binding policy of insurance

                  (k)      a Change of Control shall occur other than as a
         result of giving effect to the Transaction; or

                  (l)      any ERISA Event shall have occurred with respect to a
         Plan and the sum (determined as of the date of occurrence of such ERISA
         Event) of the Insufficiency of such Plan and the Insufficiency of any
         and all other Plans with respect to which an ERISA Event shall have
         occurred and then exist (or the liability of the Loan Parties and the
         ERISA Affiliates related to such ERISA Event) exceeds $15,000,000; or

                  (m)      any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that it has incurred
         Withdrawal Liability to such Multiemployer Plan in an amount that, when
         aggregated with all other amounts required to be paid to Multiemployer
         Plans by the Loan Parties and the ERISA Affiliates as Withdrawal
         Liability (determined as of the date of such notification), exceeds
         $15,000,000 or requires payments exceeding $3,500,000 per annum; or

                  (n)      any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer
         Plan is in reorganization or is being terminated, within the meaning of
         Title IV of ERISA, and as a result of such reorganization or
         termination the aggregate annual contributions of the Loan Parties and
         the ERISA Affiliates to all Multiemployer Plans that are then in
         reorganization or being terminated have been or will be increased over
         the amounts contributed to such Multiemployer Plans for the plan years
         of such Multiemployer Plans immediately preceding the plan year in
         which such reorganization or termination occurs by an amount exceeding
         $3,500,000; or

                  (o)      the aggregate amount of quarterly contributions
         required to be made under Section 412(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
         (determined by the actuary for the Pension Plans in accordance with the

<PAGE>
                                      134

         Pension Plans for any plan year except 2006 shall exceed $20 million,
         or for the 2006 plan year shall exceed $50.5 million; or

                  (p)      an "Event of Default" (as defined in the PBGC
         Agreement) shall have occurred under the PBGC Agreement, unless waived
         by the PBGC or cured by the US Borrower and its Subsidiaries in
         accordance with the PBGC Agreement; or

                  (q)      the PBGC Agreement shall be amended, modified or
         supplemented or any member of the Laidlaw Group shall enter into an
         additional agreement with the PBGC, in each case which materially
         increases the obligations of the Laidlaw Group with respect to the
         Pension Plans, including, without limitation, any amendment
         accelerating the payment obligations of any member of the Laidlaw Group
         under the PBGC Agreement; or

                  (r)      a Triggering Event shall occur under surety bonds in
         an aggregate penal amount of $5 million or more.

then, and in any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall at the request,
or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the US Borrower,
declare the Commitments of each Lender Party and the obligation of each Lender
Party to make Advances (other than Letter of Credit Advances by an Issuing Bank
or a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and Canadian Revolving
Credit Advances by a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.02(b)) of
each Canadian Lender to create and/or purchase Bankers' Acceptances and/or make
BA Equivalent Advances and of each Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit to be
terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at the
request, or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, (A) by notice to the
US Borrower, declare the Advances, all interest thereon and all other amounts
payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to be forthwith due
and payable, whereupon the Advances, all such interest and all such amounts
shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived
by the US Borrower, (B) by notice to each party required under the terms of any
agreement in support of which a Standby Letter of Credit is issued, request that
all Obligations under such agreement be declared to be due and payable;
provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to
Section 6.01(f) (x) the Commitments of each Lender Party and the obligation of
each Lender Party to make Advances (other than Letter of Credit Advances by an
Issuing Bank or a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and
Canadian Revolving Credit Advances by a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to
Section 2.02(c)) and of each Canadian Lender to accept and/or purchase Bankers'
Acceptances and/or Notional Bankers' Acceptances and of each Issuing Bank to
issue Letters of Credit shall automatically be terminated and (y) the Advances,
all such interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and be due and
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers.

         SECTION 6.02. Actions in Respect of the Letters of Credit, Bankers'
Acceptances BA Equivalent Advances upon Default. If any Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may, or shall at the
request of the Required Lenders, irrespective of whether it is taking any of the
actions described in Section 6.01 or otherwise, (a)
<PAGE>
                                      135

make demand upon any Borrower to, and forthwith upon such demand such Borrower
will, pay to the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lender Parties in same day
funds at the Collateral Agent's office designated in such demand, for deposit in
the L/C Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the aggregate Available
Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding and (b) make demand upon any
Canadian Borrower to, and forthwith upon such demand, such Canadian Borrower
will, pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Canadian Lenders in same
day funds at the Administrative Agent's office designated in such demand, for
deposit in the BA Collateral Account, an amount equal to the aggregate Face
Amount of all Bankers' Acceptances and Notional Bankers' Acceptances then
outstanding. If at any time the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent
determines that any funds held in the L/C Collateral Account are subject to any
right or claim of any Person other than the Agents and the Lender Parties or
that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount
of all Letters of Credit, such Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, pay to the Collateral Agent, as
additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C Collateral Account, an
amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Available Amount over (b) the
total amount of funds, if any, then held in the L/C Collateral Account that the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, determines to
be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of
Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Collateral Account, such funds
shall be applied to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank or Revolving Credit
Lenders, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law. If at any
time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held in the BA
Collateral Account are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than
the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Lenders or that the total amount of
such funds is less than the aggregate Face Amount of all Bankers' Acceptances
and Notional Bankers' Acceptances, any Canadian Borrower will, forthwith upon
demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as
additional funds to be deposited and held in the BA Collateral Account, an
amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Face Amount over (b) the total
amount of funds, if any, then held in the BA Collateral Account that the
Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and
claim.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                   THE AGENTS

         SECTION 7.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender Party (in its
capacities as a Lender, an Issuing Bank (if applicable), a Swing Line Bank (if
applicable), a Canadian Lender (if applicable) and on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates as potential Hedge Banks) hereby appoints and authorizes each Agent
to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
discretion under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to
such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers and
discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; which powers shall include,
without limitation, the entry by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the
Lenders, into the Intercreditor Agreements. As to any matters not expressly
provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement
or collection of the Notes), no Agent shall be required to exercise any
discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from
acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting)
upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such
<PAGE>
                                      136

instructions shall be binding upon all Lender Parties and all holders of Notes;
provided, however, that no Agent shall be required to take any action that
exposes such Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement
or applicable law. Each Agent agrees to give to each Lender Party prompt notice
of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

         SECTION 7.02. Agents' Reliance, Etc. Neither any Agent nor any of their
respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with
the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each Agent:
(a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until, in the case of
the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an
Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such
Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, or, in the case of any
other Agent, such Agent has received notice from the Administrative Agent that
it has received and accepted such Assignment and Acceptance, in each case as
provided in Section 8.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel
for any Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected
by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender Party and shall
not be responsible to any Lender Party for any statements, warranties or
representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with the Loan
Documents; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance, observance or satisfaction of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of any Loan Document on the part of any Loan Party or the existence
at any time of any Default under the Loan Documents or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of any Loan Party; (e) shall not be
responsible to any Lender Party for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or
in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate
or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, telecopy or telex)
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

         SECTION 7.03. CNAI, CSFB and Affiliates. With respect to its
Commitments, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, CNAI and CSFB
shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other
Lender Party and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent; and the
term "Lender Party" or "Lender Parties" shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated, include CNAI and CSFB in their respective individual capacities. CNAI
and CSFB and their respective affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money
to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking engagements
from and generally engage in any kind of business with, any Loan Party, any of
its Subsidiaries and any Person that may do business with or own securities of
any Loan Party or any such Subsidiary, all as if CNAI and CSFB were not Agents
and without any duty to account therefor to the Lender Parties. No Agent shall
have any duty to disclose any information obtained or received by it or any of
its Affiliates relating to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries to the
extent such information was obtained or received in any capacity other than as
such Agent.
<PAGE>
                                      137

         SECTION 7.04. Lender Party Credit Decision. Each Lender Party
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender Party and based on the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender Party and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement.

         SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. (a) Each Lender Party severally agrees
to indemnify each Agent (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower)
from and against such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided
below) of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such
Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action
taken or omitted by such Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED COSTS"); provided, however, that no Lender Party shall be liable
for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct as found in a final,
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation
of the foregoing, each Lender Party agrees to reimburse each Agent promptly upon
demand for its ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrowers
under Section 8.04, to the extent that such Agent is not promptly reimbursed for
such costs and expenses by the Borrowers. In the case of any investigation,
litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 7.05
applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by
any Lender Party or any other Person.

                  (b)      Each Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify each
Issuing Bank (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrowers) from and
against such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Issuing
Bank in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action
taken or omitted by such Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents; provided,
however, that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Issuing Bank's gross
negligence or willful misconduct as found in a final, non-appealable judgment by
a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender Party agrees to reimburse such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its
ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and
expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrowers under Section 8.04, to the extent
that such Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by
the Borrowers.

                  (c)      For purposes of this Section 7.05, the Lender
Parties' respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any
time, according to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Advances
outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lender
<PAGE>
                                      138

Parties, (ii) their respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Available Amount
of all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time, (iii) the aggregate unused
portions of their respective Term B Commitments at such time, (iv) their
respective pro rata shares of the aggregate Face Amount of all Bankers'
Acceptances or Notional Bankers' Acceptances outstanding at such time and (v)
their respective Unused Revolving Credit Commitments at such time; provided,
that the aggregate principal amount of Canadian Advances owing to any Canadian
Lender, the Face Amount of Bankers' Acceptances or Notional Bankers' Acceptances
outstanding at such time and of Letter of Credit Advances owing to any Issuing
Bank shall be considered to be owed to the Revolving Credit Lenders ratably in
accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments. The failure of
any Lender Party to reimburse any Agent or any Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to be paid by
the Lender Parties to such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, as
provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender Party of its obligation
hereunder to reimburse such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for
its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender Party shall be responsible for
the failure of any other Lender Party to reimburse such Agent or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, for such other Lender Party's ratable share of such
amount. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Lender
Party hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each Lender Party contained in
this Section 7.05 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and
all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 7.06. Successor Agents. Any Agent may resign as to any or all
of the Facilities at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lender
Parties and the US Borrower and may be removed as to all of the Facilities at
any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that
any removal of the Administrative Agent will not be effective until it has also
been replaced as Collateral Agent, Canadian Lender and Letter of Credit Issuing
Bank and released from all of its obligations in respect thereof. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor Agent as to such of the Facilities as to which such Agent has resigned
or been removed. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after
the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders'
removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Lender Parties, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank
organized under the laws of the United States or of any State thereof and having
a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent as to all of the
Facilities and, in the case of a successor Collateral Agent, upon the execution
and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and
such amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other instruments or
notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders
<PAGE>
                                      139

may request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or
purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor Agent shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges
and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent as to less than all of
the Facilities and, in the case of a successor Collateral Agent, upon the
execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments
thereto, and such amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other
instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required
Lenders may request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or
purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor Agent shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges
and duties of the retiring Agent as to such Facilities, other than with respect
to funds transfers and other similar aspects of the administration of Borrowings
under such Facilities, issuances of Letters of Credit (notwithstanding any
resignation as Agent with respect to the Letter of Credit Facility) and payments
by the Borrowers in respect of such Facilities, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement
as to such Facilities, other than as aforesaid. If within 45 days after written
notice is given of the retiring Agent's resignation or removal under this
Section 7.06 no successor Agent shall have been appointed and shall have
accepted such appointment, then on such 45th day (a) the retiring Agent's
resignation or removal shall become effective, (b) the retiring Agent shall
thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents
and (c) the Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all duties of the retiring
Agent under the Loan Documents until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor Agent as provided above. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent as to any of the Facilities shall have
become effective, the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit
as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent as to
such Facilities under this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.07. Appointment of Supplemental Collateral Agents. (a) It is
the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be
no violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of
banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in
such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the
enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Collateral Agent deems
that by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction it may not
exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the
other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or
necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that the Collateral Agent
appoint an additional individual or institution as a separate trustee,
co-trustee, collateral agent, collateral sub-agent or collateral co-agent (any
such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually
as a "SUPPLEMENTAL COLLATERAL AGENT" and collectively as "SUPPLEMENTAL
COLLATERAL AGENTS").

                  (b)      In the event that the Collateral Agent appoints a
Supplemental Collateral Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every
right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the
Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and
vest in such Supplemental Collateral Agent to the extent, and only to the
extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Collateral Agent to exercise such
rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform
such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation
contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance
thereof by such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall run to and be enforceable by
either the Collateral Agent or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, and (ii) the
provisions of this Article and of Section 8.04 that refer to the Collateral
Agent or the Agents shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Collateral
Agent and all references therein to the Collateral Agent or the Agents shall be
deemed to include a reference to such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the
context may require.
<PAGE>
                                      140

                  (c)      Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party
be required by any Supplemental Collateral Agent so appointed by the Collateral
Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such
rights, powers, privileges and duties, such Loan Party shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by
the Collateral Agent. In case any Supplemental Collateral Agent, or a successor
thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Collateral Agent, to
the extent permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Collateral
Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral Agent.

         SECTION 7.08. Appointment of Citibank, Canada as Fonde de Pouvoir. The
Lenders hereby appoint Citibank, Canada to act as the fonde de pouvoir ("person
holding the power of attorney") on behalf of the Lenders, as contemplated in
article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec, in order to obtain, receive and hold
for, in the name of and for the benefit of the Lenders, all hypothecs, rights
and security interests created by the Quebec Security Documents as security for
the payment of the Obligations and the Guaranteed Obligations and the
performance of the Obligations and the Guaranteed Obligations under the Loan
Documents, including the Quebec Security Documents.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 8.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement or the Notes or any other Loan Document, nor consent to any
departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be in writing and signed (or, in the case of the Collateral
Documents, consented to) by the Required Lenders, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given; provided, however, that (a) no amendment, waiver or
consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all of the Lender Parties (other
than any Lender Party that is, at such time, a Defaulting Lender), do any of the
following at any time: (i) waive any of the conditions specified in Section 3.01
or Section 3.02 or, in the case of the Initial Extension of Credit, Section
3.03, (ii) change the number of Lenders or the definition of Required Lenders or
the percentage of (w) the Commitments, (x) the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the Advances, (y) the aggregate Available Amount of outstanding Letters of
Credit that, in each case, shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to
take any action hereunder or (z) the aggregate Face Amount of outstanding
Bankers' Acceptances or Notional Bankers' Acceptances that, in each case, shall
be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, (iii)
reduce or limit the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 1 of the Guaranty
issued by it or release such Guarantor or otherwise limit such Guarantor's
liability with respect to the Obligations owing to the Agents and the Lender
Parties, (iv) release all or substantially all of the Collateral in any
transaction or series of related transactions or permit the creation,
incurrence, assumption or existence of any Lien on all or substantially all of
the Collateral in any transaction or series of related transactions to secure
any Obligations other than Obligations owing to the Secured Parties under the
Loan Documents, or (v) amend Section 2.14 or this Section 8.01 and (b) no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Required
Lenders and each Lender (other than any Lender that is, at such time, a
Defaulting Lender) that has a
<PAGE>
                                      141

Commitment under, or is owed any amounts under or in respect of, the Term B
Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility if such Lender is directly and
adversely affected by such amendment, waiver or consent: (i) increase the
Commitments of such Lender; (ii) reduce the principal of, or stated rate of
interest on, the Notes held by such Lender or any fees or other amounts stated
to be payable hereunder to such Lender; or (iii) postpone or forgive any date
scheduled for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes pursuant to
Section 2.04 or 2.08 or any date fixed for any payment of fees hereunder or any
Guaranteed Obligations payable under the US Subsidiary Guaranty or the Canadian
Subsidiary Guaranty; provided, further, that no amendment, waiver or consent
shall, unless in writing and signed by each Canadian Lender or each Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, in addition to the Lenders required above to take such
action, affect the rights or obligations of the Canadian Lenders or of the
Issuing Banks, as the case may be, under this Agreement; and provided, further,
that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by an

                  (b)      So long as CNAI is the Administrative Agent,

may make such materials, as well as any other written information, documents,
instruments and other material relating to any Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries
or any other materials or matters relating to this Agreement, the Notes or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "COMMUNICATIONS")
available to the Lenders by posting such notices on "e-Disclosure" (the
"PLATFORM"), the Administrative Agent's internet delivery system that is part of
Fixed Income Direct, Global Fixed Income's primary web portal. Although the
primary web portal is secured with a dual firewall and a User ID/Password
Authorization System and the Platform is secured through a single user per deal
authorization method whereby each user may access the Platform only on a
deal-by-deal basis, each Borrower acknowledges that (i) the distribution of
material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there
are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution, (ii) the
Platform is provided "as is" and "as available" and (iii) neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates warrants the accuracy, adequacy
or completeness of the Communications or the Platform and each expressly
disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the Communications or the
Platform. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including,
without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other
code defects, is made by the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the Platform.

                  (c)      Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in
the next sentence) (a "NOTICE") specifying that any Communications have been
posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such information,
documents or other materials to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement;
provided that, if requested by any Lender, the Administrative Agent shall
deliver a copy of the Communications to such Lender by e-mail or telecopier.
Each Lender agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing of such
Lender's e-mail address to which a Notice may be sent by electronic transmission
(including by electronic communication) on or before the date such Lender
becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter to ensure
that the Administrative Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such
Lender) and (ii) that any Notice may be sent to such e-mail address.

         SECTION 8.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender
Party or any Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
or under any Note or any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                                      143

         SECTION 8.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) Each Borrower agrees to pay on
demand (i) all reasonable costs and expenses of each Agent in connection with
the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment
of, or any consent or waiver under, the Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, (A) all due diligence, collateral review, syndication,
transportation, computer, duplication, appraisal, audit, insurance, consultant,
search, filing and recording fees and expenses and (B) the reasonable fees and
expenses of a single outside counsel and other local counsel for the
Administrative Agent with respect thereto, with respect to advising the
Administrative Agent as to its rights and responsibilities, or the perfection,
protection or preservation of rights or interests, under the Loan Documents,
with respect to negotiations with any Loan Party or with other creditors of any
Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of any Default or any events
or circumstances that may give rise to a Default and with respect to presenting
claims in or otherwise participating in or monitoring any bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar proceeding involving creditors' rights generally and any
proceeding ancillary thereto) and (ii) all costs and expenses of each Agent and
each Lender Party in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents,
whether in any action, suit or litigation, or any bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar proceeding affecting creditors' rights generally (including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
Administrative Agent and each Lender Party with respect thereto).

                  (b)      Each Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and save
and hold harmless each Agent, each Lender Party and each of their Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, trustees and
representatives (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against, and shall pay
on demand, any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel),
joint or several, that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any
Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by
reason of (including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation,
litigation or proceeding or preparation of a defense in connection therewith)
(i) the Facilities, the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances,
the Bankers' Acceptances or the Letters of Credit, the Transaction Documents or
any of the transactions contemplated thereby or any similar transaction or (ii)
the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials on any property of any
Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any Environmental Action relating in
any way to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent such
claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such
Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of an
investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this
Section 8.04(b) applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such
investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its
directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other
Person, whether or not any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and
whether or not the Transaction is consummated. Each Borrower also agrees not to
assert any claim against any Agent, any Lender Party or any of their Affiliates,
or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors,
trustees and representatives, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the
Facilities, the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances, the
Bankers' Acceptances or the Letters of Credit, the Transaction Documents or any
of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

                                      144

                  (c)      If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any
Eurodollar Rate Advance is made by any Borrower to or for the account of a
Lender Party other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance,
as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.10(b)(i) or
2.11(d), acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01
or for any other reason or if any Borrower fails to make any payment or
prepayment of an Advance for which a notice of prepayment has been given or that
is otherwise required to be made, whether pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.07 or 6.01
or otherwise, such Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy
of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender Party any amounts required to compensate such Lender
Party for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur
as a result of such payment or Conversion or such failure to pay or prepay, as
the case may be, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender Party to fund or
maintain such Advance.

                  (d)      If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs,
expenses or other amounts payable by it under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel and indemnities, such amount
may be paid on behalf of such Loan Party by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender Party, in its sole discretion.

                  (e)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the
agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained in Sections 2.11 and 2.13
and this Section 8.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest
and all other amounts payable hereunder and under any of the other Loan
Documents.

         SECTION 8.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare the Advances due and payable pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.01, each Agent and each Lender Party and each of their
respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and otherwise apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent, such Lender Party
or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against
any and all of the Obligations of any Borrower now or hereafter existing under
the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether such Agent or such Lender Party
shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note or Notes and
although such Obligations may be unmatured; provided, however, that no deposit
or other indebtedness owed to any Canadian Borrower may be set off or applied
against any Obligation of any U.S. Loan Party. Each Agent and each Lender Party
agrees promptly to notify such Borrower after any such set-off and application;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Agent and each
Lender Party and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition
to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) that such Agent, such Lender Party and their respective Affiliates may
have.

         SECTION 8.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by each Borrower and each Agent and the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender Party that
such Initial Lender Party has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of each Borrower, each Agent and each Lender Party and
their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrowers shall not
have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of the Lender Parties.

         SECTION 8.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may
assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note
or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be
of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under
and in respect of any or all Facilities, (ii) except in the case of an
assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender,
an Affiliate of any Lender or an Approved Fund of any Lender or an assignment of
all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the aggregate
amount of the Commitments being assigned to such Eligible Assignee pursuant to
such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $1,000,000 and shall
be an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, such
lesser amount as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent and, so long as
no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of effectiveness of
such assignment, the US Borrower) under each Facility for which a Commitment is
being assigned, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee,
(iv) no such assignments shall be permitted without the consent of the
Administrative Agent until the Administrative Agent shall have notified the
Lender Parties that syndication of the Commitments hereunder has been completed,
(v) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note or Notes subject to such
assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and (vi) each such
Eligible Assignee shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.13(e), if
applicable.

                  (b)      Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and
Acceptance, (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, hereunder and (ii) the Lender or Issuing
Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.11, 2.13 and 8.04
to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to such
assignment) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in
the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion
of an assigning Lender's or Issuing Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

                  (c)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, each Lender Party assignor thereunder and each assignee thereunder
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties thereto and hereto as
follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and
<PAGE>
                                      146

Acceptance, such assigning Lender Party makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with any Loan Document or the
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or
purported to be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (ii) such assigning
Lender Party makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility
with respect to the financial condition of any Loan Party or the performance or
observance by any Loan Party of any of its obligations under any Loan Document
or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such
assignee will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent, such assigning
Lender Party or any other Lender Party and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such
assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints
and authorizes each Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers and discretion under the Loan Documents as are delegated to
such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers and
discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that
by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender or
Issuing Bank, as the case may be.

                  (d)      The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose
(but only for this purpose) as the agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at its
address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lender Parties and the Commitment under each Facility of,
and principal amount of the Advances owing under each Facility to, each Lender
Party from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrowers, the Agents and the Lender Parties shall treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the Register as a Lender Party hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or
any Agent or any Lender Party at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

                  (e)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender Party and an assignee, together with any Note or
Notes subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such
Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the
information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
thereof to the US Borrower and each other Agent. In the case of any assignment
by a Lender, within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the
applicable Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or Notes (which shall
be marked "Amended and Restated") an amended and restated Note to the order of
such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it under
each Facility pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if any assigning
Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder under such Facility, an amended and

<PAGE>
                                      147

restated Note to the order of such assigning Lender in an amount equal to the
Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such amended and restated Note or Notes
shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of
such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form
of Exhibit A-1 or A-2 hereto, as the case may be.

                  (f)      Each Issuing Bank may assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the undrawn
portion of its Letter of Credit Commitment at any time; provided, however, that
(i) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that immediately prior to
such assignment was an Issuing Bank or an assignment of all of an Issuing Bank's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Letter of Credit
Commitment of the assigning Issuing Bank being assigned pursuant to each such
assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $1,000,000 and shall
be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (ii) each such
assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee and (iii) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.

                  (g)      Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or
more Persons (other than any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to
it and the Note or Notes (if any) held by it); provided, however, that (i) such
Lender Party's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
its Commitments) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender Party shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, (iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such Note
for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Agents and the other
Lender Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender Party
in connection with such Lender Party's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any
right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document,
or any consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except to the
extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation, postpone any date fixed for
any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other
amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or release all or substantially all of the Collateral.

                  (h)      Any Lender Party may, in connection with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to
this Section 8.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee
or participant any information relating to the Borrowers furnished to such
Lender Party by or on behalf of any Borrower; provided, however, that, prior to
any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential
Information received by it from such Lender Party.

                  (i)      Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender Party may at any time create a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under
<PAGE>
                                      148

this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing to it and the
Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance
with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

                  (j)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans may, without the
consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, create a security interest
in all or any portion of the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by
it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such
fund as security for such obligations or securities, provided, that unless and
until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other
provisions of this Section 8.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging
Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such
trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under
the Loan Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights
with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

                  (k)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Lender Party (a "GRANTING LENDER") may grant to a special purpose
funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting
Lender to the Administrative Agent and the US Borrower (an "SPC") the option to
provide all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise
be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that (i) nothing
herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Advance, and (ii) if
an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any
part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such
Advance pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of an Advance by an SPC
hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same
extent, and as if, such Advance were made by such Granting Lender. Each party
hereto hereby agrees that (i) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or
similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender Party would
be liable, (ii) no SPC shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11 and
2.13 (or any other increased costs protection provision) and (iii) the Granting
Bank shall for all purposes, including, without limitation, the approval of any
amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the Lender
Party of record hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement)
that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior Debt of any SPC, it will not
institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any SPC may (i) with
notice to, but without prior consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent and with the payment of a processing fee of $500, assign all or any
portion of its interest in any Advance to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose
on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of
Advances to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety
or guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This subsection (k)
may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Lender,
all or any part of whose Advances are being funded by the SPC at the time of
such amendment.

         SECTION 8.08. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which
<PAGE>
                                      149

when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery by telecopier of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement shall be effective
as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         SECTION 8.09. No Liability of the Issuing Banks. Each Borrower assumes
all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any
Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither any
Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or responsible
for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or
omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the
validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement
thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by such Issuing Bank
against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter
of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate
reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in
making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that any
Borrower shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank
shall be liable to such Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not
consequential, damages suffered by such Borrower that such Borrower proves were
caused by (i) such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence as
determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of
Credit comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Bank's
willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the
presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the terms
and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face
to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary.

         SECTION 8.10. Confidentiality. (a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, each
of the Agents and the Lender Parties hereby agrees that it will not disclose to
any person or entity any Confidential Information, except that each of the
Agents and the Lender Parties may disclose Confidential Information (i) to its
and its Affiliates' officers, directors, employees, agents, accountants,
attorneys, and other advisors (collectively "LENDER REPRESENTATIVES") who have a
need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of assisting in the
negotiation, completion and administration of the Facilities, (ii) to actual or
potential Lenders who have agreed to hold the Confidential Information in
confidence on substantially the same terms as provided herein, (iii) to any
direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such
contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor)
to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of any Borrower and
(iv) to the extent any portion of such Confidential Information (A) is or
becomes generally available to the public on a non-confidential basis other than
as a result of a breach of this Section 8.10 by any of the Agents or the Lender
Parties or any of the Lender Representatives, (B) is or becomes available to any
of the Agents or the Lender Parties or any of the Lender Representatives on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than a Borrower or (C) is required to
be disclosed by law, regulation or judicial order or is requested by any
regulatory body with jurisdiction over any of the Agents or the Lender Parties
or any of the Lender Representatives.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Borrowers, the Agents, the Lender Parties and the Lender Representatives may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. tax
treatment and tax structure of the transactions and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to any of the
foregoing parties relating to such U.S. tax treatment and tax structure.

         SECTION 8.11. Release of Collateral. Upon the sale, lease, transfer or
other disposition of any item of Collateral of any Loan Party (including,
without limitation, as a result of the sale, in accordance with the terms of the
Loan Documents, of the Loan Party that owns such Collateral) in accordance with
the terms of the Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent will, at the US Borrower's
expense, execute and deliver to such Loan Party such documents as such Loan
Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral
from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents
in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 8.12. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the
United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from
any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State
court or, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. The
Canadian Borrowers hereby agree that service of process in any such action or
proceeding brought in any such New York State court or in such federal court may
be made upon the US Borrower at its address for notices as provided for in
Section 8.02 and the Canadian Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Borrower
its authorized agent to accept such service of process, and the US Borrower
hereby accepts such appointment, and the Borrowers agree that the failure of the
US Borrower to give any notice of any such service shall not impair or affect
the validity of such service or of any judgment rendered in any action or
proceeding based thereon. The Canadian Borrowers hereby further irrevocably
consents to the service of process in any action or proceeding to the Canadian
Borrowers at their respective addresses specified in Section 8.02. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in the
courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (b)      Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party in any New York State or
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

         SECTION 8.13. Judgment Currency. (a) To the extent permitted by
applicable law, if for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is
necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in US Dollars into another currency,
the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so,
that the rate of exchange used shall be determined in accordance with Section
1.04 of this Agreement on the Business Day preceding that on which final
judgment is given.

                  (b)      To the extent permitted by applicable law, if for the
purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due
hereunder in a foreign currency into US Dollars, the parties agree to the
fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used
shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.04 of this Agreement on the
Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.

                  (c)      To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
obligation of each Borrower in respect of any sum due in US Dollars from it to
any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding
any judgment in a currency other than US Dollars, be discharged only to the
extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender Party or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in
such other currency, such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case
may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase US Dollars
with such other currency; if the US Dollars so purchased are less than such sum
due to such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) in US
Dollars, each Borrower agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such
Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) against such loss,
and if the US Dollars so purchased exceed such sum due to any Lender Party or
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) in US Dollars, such Lender Party
or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to each such
Borrower such excess.

         SECTION 8.14. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

         SECTION 8.15. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Borrowers, the Agents
and the Lender Parties irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to any of the Loan Documents, the
Advances, the Letters of Credit or the actions of any Agent or any Lender Party
in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized,
as of the date first above written.
