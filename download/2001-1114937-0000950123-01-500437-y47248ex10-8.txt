       3.1.9  on and as of the proposed date for the making of such Revolving
              Advance:

              (a)    in the case of any Revolving Advance requested to be made
                     during the Certain Funds Period, no Certain Funds Event of
                     Default is continuing;

              (b)    in the case of Revolving Advances not within paragraph (a)
                     above (other than Rollover Advances), (i) no Event of
                     Default or Potential Event of Default is continuing and
                     (ii) the Repeated Representations are true in all material
                     respects; or

              (c)    in the case of Rollover Advances not within paragraph (a)
                     above, (i) no Event of Default is continuing and (ii) those
                     of the Repeated Representations which are not capable of
                     remedy or change if incorrect or misleading in any material
                     respect, are true in all material respects.

3.2    TERMS ENDING ON REDUCTION DATES

       The Borrowers shall ensure that there are sufficient Revolving Advances
       with Terms ending on or before the next succeeding Reduction Date to
       allow the reduction in the Total Commitments scheduled to take place on
       that Reduction Date to occur. If the Borrowers have not so ensured the
       Agent may, subject to Clause 24.4 (Break Costs), shorten the Terms of one
       or more Revolving Advances agreed with the Relevant Obligor to so ensure.

3.3    EACH BANK'S PARTICIPATION IN REVOLVING ADVANCES

       Each Bank will participate through its Facility Office in each Revolving
       Advance made pursuant to this Clause 3 in the proportion borne by its
       Available Commitment to the Available Facility immediately prior to the
       making of that Revolving Advance.

3.4    REDUCTION OF AVAILABLE COMMITMENT

       If a Bank's Commitment is reduced in accordance with the terms hereof
       after the Agent has received the Notice of Drawdown for a Revolving
       Advance and such reduction was not taken into account in the Available
       Facility, then the amount of that Revolving Advance shall be reduced
       accordingly.

4.     PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON REVOLVING ADVANCES

4.1    PAYMENT OF INTEREST

       On the Repayment Date relating to each Revolving Advance (and, if the
       Term of such Revolving Advance exceeds six months, on the expiry of each
       period of six months during such Term) the Borrower to which such
       Revolving Advance has been made shall pay accrued interest on that
       Revolving Advance.

4.2    CALCULATION OF INTEREST

       The rate of interest applicable to a Revolving Advance from time to time
       during its Term shall be the rate per annum which is the sum of:

       4.2.1  the Margin at such time;

       4.2.2  the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

       4.2.3  LIBOR.

4.3    MARGIN RATCHET

       The Margin shall:

       4.3.1  from the date hereof until the Pushdown Date, be 2.25 per cent.
              per annum;

       4.3.2  (if relevant) on and after the Pushdown Date and until the date
              falling 12 months after the date hereof, be 2.00 per cent. per
              annum; and

       4.3.3  at any other time, subject to clause 4.5 (Default Margin) and in
              accordance with the provisions of Clause 4.4 (Margin Changes), be
              the percentage rate per annum determined by the ratio of EBITDA of
              the UK Group in respect of the Relevant Period ended on the most
              recent Quarter Date to the Total Net Cash Finance Charges for that
              Relevant Period in accordance with the table set out below.

</TABLE>

4.4    MARGIN CHANGES

       Any reduction or increase to the Margin provided for by Clause 4.3
       (Margin Ratchet) shall take effect in relation to all existing Revolving
       Advances and future Revolving Advances, in each case with effect from the
       date the Agent receives the Parent's Compliance Certificate in accordance
       with Clause 17.4 (Compliance Certificates) for


                                      -53-
<PAGE>   57
       its most recent Financial Quarter. Any change in the Margin applicable to
       an existing Revolving Advance shall only relate to the remainder of the
       current Term of such a Revolving Advance.

4.5    DEFAULT MARGIN

       The Margin shall be 2.25 per cent. per annum from the date determined by
       the Agent (acting reasonably) (in writing) as being the date on which an
       Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred or come into
       existence until the date specified by the Agent (in writing) as being the
       date on which it has been demonstrated to its satisfaction (acting
       reasonably) that such Event of Default or Potential Event of Default is
       no longer continuing. The Agent shall promptly notify the other parties
       hereto of any determination that an Event of Default or Potential Event
       of Default has occurred or exists or, as the case may be, that it has
       been demonstrated to its reasonable satisfaction that such is no longer
       continuing.

5.     INCREMENTAL FACILITY

5.1    REQUEST FOR INCREMENTAL FACILITY

       If no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred and is
       continuing, the Parent may, at any time after the date falling 12 months
       after the Acquisition Date, deliver to the Agent and the Arrangers a
       request (the "INCREMENTAL FACILITY REQUEST") requesting that the
       Arrangers arrange the Incremental Facility.

5.2    REQUIREMENTS OF INCREMENTAL FACILITY REQUEST

       The Incremental Facility Request shall be in writing and shall specify:

       5.2.1  the proposed amount of the Incremental Facility, which shall not
              exceed L500,000,000;

       5.2.2  the proposed final maturity date of the Incremental Facility,
              which shall be no earlier than 31 March 2006;

       5.2.3  the proposed margin payable on amounts drawn under the Incremental
              Facility; and

       5.2.4  the other proposed key terms and conditions of the Incremental
              Facility, which shall be no more onerous than the terms of this
              Agreement.

5.3    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY BANKS

       The Banks consent to the incurrence by the Borrowers of the additional
       indebtedness under the Incremental Facility, which shall rank pari passu
       with indebtedness under the Revolving Facility. Subject to an
       intercreditor agreement acceptable to all of the Banks being entered into
       between the Banks and the lenders under the Incremental Facility, the
       indebtedness under the Incremental Facility may be secured on assets
       subject to the Security. The Banks (and/or their designated
       representatives) shall negotiate in good faith with the proposed lenders
       under the Incremental Facility, with a view to such an intercreditor
       agreement being agreed and executed as soon as reasonably practicable.
       The Banks shall have the opportunity, but shall not be obliged, to
       participate in the

                                      -54-
<PAGE>   58
       Incremental Facility and hereby consent to the Incremental Facility being
       offered to persons who are not Banks at the time the Incremental Facility
       Request is delivered by the Parent. The Incremental Facility shall be
       priced by reference to market conditions on and around the date of
       delivery of the Incremental Facility Request, but shall otherwise contain
       terms no more onerous than the terms hereof, as the same shall be agreed
       between the parties hereto and any additional persons who agree to
       participate in the Incremental Facility.

6.     MARKET DISRUPTION AND ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES

6.1    MARKET DISRUPTION

       If, in relation to any Revolving Advance:

       6.1.1  LIBOR is to be determined by reference to Reference Banks and at
              or about 11.00 a.m. on the Quotation Date for the relevant Term
              none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies a rate for the
              purpose of determining LIBOR for the relevant Term; or

       6.1.2  before the close of business in London on the Quotation Date for
              such Revolving Advance the Agent has been notified by a Bank or
              each of a group of Banks, to whom in aggregate fifty per cent. or
              more of such Revolving Advance would be owed if made that the
              LIBOR rate does not accurately reflect the cost of funding its
              participation in such Revolving Advance,

       then the Agent shall notify the Relevant Obligor, the relevant Borrower
       and the Banks of such event and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
       in this Agreement, Clause 6.2 (Substitute Term and Interest Rate) shall
       apply to such Revolving Advance (if it is a Rollover Advance). If
       sub-clause 6.1.1 or 6.1.2 applies to a proposed Revolving Advance (other
       than a Rollover Advance), such a Revolving Advance shall not be made.

6.2    SUBSTITUTE TERM AND INTEREST RATE

       If sub-clause 6.1.1 of Clause 6.1 (Market Disruption) applies to a
       Revolving Advance, the duration of the relevant Term shall be one month
       or, if less, such that it shall end on the next succeeding Reduction Date
       or, as the case may be, the Final Maturity Date. If either sub-clause
       6.1.1 or 6.1.2 of Clause 6.1 (Market Disruption) applies to a Revolving
       Advance, the rate of interest applicable to each Bank's portion of such
       Revolving Advance during the relevant Term shall (subject to any
       agreement reached pursuant to Clause 6.3 (Alternative Rate)) be the rate
       per annum which is the sum of:

       6.2.1  the Margin at such time;

       6.2.2  the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

       6.2.3  the rate per annum notified to the Agent by such Bank before the
              last day of such Term to be that which expresses as a percentage
              rate per annum the cost to such Bank of funding from whatever
              sources it may reasonably select its portion of such Revolving
              Advance during such Term.


                                      -55-
<PAGE>   59
6.3    ALTERNATIVE RATE

       If either of those events mentioned in sub-clauses 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 of
       Clause 6.1 (Market Disruption) occurs in relation to a Revolving Advance,
       then if the Agent or the Relevant Obligor so requires, the Agent and the
       Relevant Obligor shall enter into negotiations with a view to agreeing a
       substitute basis (i) for determining the rates of interest from time to
       time applicable to the Revolving Advances and/or (ii) upon which the
       Revolving Advances may be maintained (whether in sterling or some other
       currency) thereafter and any such substitute basis that is agreed shall
       take effect in accordance with its terms and be binding on each party
       hereto, PROVIDED THAT the Agent may not agree any such substitute basis
       without the prior consent of each Bank (which is not to be unreasonably
       withheld).

7.     NOTIFICATION

7.1    REVOLVING ADVANCES

       The Agent shall, promptly upon its receipt of a Notice of Drawdown,
       notify each Bank of:

       7.1.1  if applicable, the name of the Borrower;

       7.1.2  the proposed amount of the relevant Revolving Advance;

       7.1.3  the proposed length of the relevant Term; and

       7.1.4  the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Revolving Advance
              allocated to such Bank pursuant to Clause 3.3 (Each Bank's
              Participation in Revolving Advances).

7.2    INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION

       The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower and the Banks of
       each determination of LIBOR, the Mandatory Cost Rate and the Margin.

7.3    CHANGES TO REVOLVING ADVANCES OR INTEREST RATES

       The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower and the Banks of
       any change to (a) the proposed length of a Term or (b) any interest rate
       occasioned by the operation of Clause 6 (Market Disruption and
       Alternative Interest Rates).

8.     REPAYMENT AND REDUCTION OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY

8.1    REPAYMENT

       Each Borrower to which a Revolving Advance has been made shall repay the
       Revolving Advance made to it in full on the Repayment Date relating
       thereto.

8.2    REDUCTION

       8.2.1  The Total Commitments shall be reduced in instalments on each
              Reduction Date by an amount equal to the amount (the "REDUCTION
              INSTALMENT"), as set out in the table below:

</TABLE>

       8.2.2  The Parent shall, to the extent necessary, procure that sufficient
              Revolving Advances are repaid on a Reduction Date to ensure that
              the aggregate of the outstanding Revolving Advances (after such
              repayment) is equal to or less than the reduced amount of the
              Total Commitments.

       8.2.3  Any reduction of the Total Commitments shall reduce
              proportionately the Commitment of each Bank.

       8.2.4  If any Borrower cancels the whole or any part of the Commitments
              in accordance with Clause 9.1 (Cancellation of the Revolving
              Facility) or if the Available Commitment of any Bank is reduced
              under Clause 9.5 (No Further Revolving Advances), Clause 10.7
              (Application of Proceeds) or Clause 14 (Illegality) then the
              amount of the Reduction Instalment for each Reduction Date falling
              after that cancellation will reduce pro rata by the amount
              cancelled.

9.     CANCELLATION AND PREPAYMENT

9.1    CANCELLATION OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY

       The Relevant Obligor may, by giving to the Agent not less than five
       Business Days' prior written notice to that effect, cancel the whole or
       any part (being a minimum amount of L50,000,000 and an integral multiple
       of L10,000,000) of the Available Facility. Any such cancellation shall
       reduce the Available Commitment and Commitment of each Bank rateably. Any
       amount so cancelled under this Clause 9.1 may not be reborrowed.

9.2    PREPAYMENT OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY

       Subject to the provisions of Clause 24.4 (Break Costs), a Borrower to
       which a Revolving Advance has been made may, by giving to the Agent not
       less than five Business Days' prior written notice to that effect, prepay
       the whole or any part of a Revolving Advance (being a minimum amount of
       L50,000,000 and an integral multiple of L10,000,000).

9.3    NOTICE OF CANCELLATION OR PREPAYMENT

       Any notice of cancellation or prepayment given by the Relevant Obligor or
       a Borrower pursuant to this Clause 9 shall be irrevocable, shall specify
       the date upon which such cancellation or prepayment is to be made and the
       amount of such cancellation or prepayment and, in the case of a notice of
       prepayment, shall oblige the relevant Borrower to make such prepayment on
       such date.

9.4    REPAYMENT OF A BANK'S SHARE OF THE REVOLVING LOAN

       If:

       9.4.1  any sum payable to any Bank by an Obligor is required to be
              increased pursuant to Clause 11.1 (Tax Gross-up); or

       9.4.2  any Bank claims indemnification from an Obligor under Clause 11.2
              (Tax Indemnity), the Agent claims indemnification from an Obligor
              under Clause 11.2 (Tax Indemnity) in respect of a payment received
              by it and paid by it to a Bank under the Finance Documents or any
              Bank claims indemnification from a Borrower under Clause 13.1
              (Increased Costs),

       the Relevant Obligor may, whilst such circumstance continues, give the
       Agent at least five Business Days' prior written notice (which notice
       shall be irrevocable) of its intention to procure the repayment of such
       Bank's share of the Revolving Loan. On the last day of each then current
       Term, or at any other time subject to the provisions of Clause 24.4
       (Break Costs), each Borrower to which a Revolving Advance has been made
       shall repay such Bank's portion of the Revolving Advance to which such
       Term relates.

9.5    NO FURTHER REVOLVING ADVANCES

       A Bank for whose account a repayment is to be made under Clause 9.4
       (Repayment of a Bank's Share of the Revolving Loan) shall not be obliged
       to participate in the making of Revolving Advances on or after the date
       upon which the Agent receives the Relevant Obligor's notice of its
       intention to procure the repayment of such Bank's share of the Revolving
       Loan, and such Bank's Available Commitment shall be reduced to zero.

9.6    NO OTHER REPAYMENTS

       The Borrowers shall not repay all or any part of the Revolving Loan
       except at the times and in the manner expressly provided for in this
       Agreement.

10.    MANDATORY PREPAYMENT

10.1   MANDATORY PREPAYMENT FROM EXCESS CASH FLOW

       The Parent shall ensure that within ten Business Days of delivery of the
       most recent financial statements of the UK Group pursuant to Clause 17.1
       (Annual Statements), commencing with the financial statements delivered
       in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2003, 50 per cent. of
       Excess Cash Flow for the financial year to which such financial
       statements relate is applied in cancellation and repayment of the
       Revolving Loan in accordance with Clause 10.7 (Application of Proceeds).

10.2   MANDATORY PREPAYMENT FROM ASSET DISPOSALS

       Prior to the Pushdown Date, the CWC Parent and the Original Borrower and,
       after the Pushdown Date, the Parent shall ensure that the net proceeds of
       any disposal falling within paragraph (g)(A) of the definition of
       Permitted Disposals of any asset by any member of the Target Group or,
       after the Pushdown Date, any member of the UK Group, are applied in
       cancellation and repayment of the Revolving Loan in accordance with
       Clause 10.7 (Application of Proceeds) unless the relevant member of the
       Target

                                      -58-

       Group or, as the case may be, the UK Group can show to the satisfaction
       of the Agent (acting reasonably) that:

       10.2.1 such disposal was on arms' length terms and the net proceeds are
              to be reinvested in similar or like assets of a comparable or
              superior quality or applied towards the Target Group's or, as the
              case may be (after the Pushdown Date), the UK Group's Capital
              Expenditure within a period of 365 days from the date of receipt
              of such proceeds by the relevant member of the Target Group or, as
              the case may be, the UK Group; or

              usual course of business of such member of the Target Group or, as
              the case may be, the UK Group; or

       10.2.3 the net disposal proceeds, when aggregated with the net disposal
              proceeds received by members of the Target Group and, after the
              Pushdown Date, the UK Group in respect of disposals falling within
              paragraph (g)(A) of the definition of Permitted Disposals made in

              the proceeds from disposals falling within sub-clauses 10.2.1 or
              10.2.2 above), does not exceed L10,000,000 or its equivalent.

       In the case of sub-clause 10.2.1 only, the net disposal proceeds referred

       case may be, require the Parent, the CWC Parent or the Original Borrower
       to withdraw) sums from such account only to the extent that it is able
       reasonably to demonstrate that such sums will be reinvested or applied in
       accordance with the provisions of sub-clause 10.2.1. Any amounts not
       reinvested as specified in sub-clause 10.2.1 during the 365 day period

       the Agent and applied in repayment of the Revolving Loan in accordance
       with Clause 10.7 (Application of Proceeds) unless the Insurance Proceeds
       received above the Minimum Threshold are:

       10.3.1 promptly upon receipt, deposited in the Prepayment Escrow Account
              in accordance with the provisions of Clause 10.4 (Payment of

              the relevant insurance claim was made (or to refinance any
              expenditure incurred in the replacement, reinstatement and/or
              repair of such assets and/or the satisfaction of business
              interruption losses) within a period of 365 days from the date of

       the case may be, the UK Group that received the Insurance Proceeds shall
       be entitled, during the period of 365 days from its receipt of the
       Insurance Proceeds, to withdraw sums from the Prepayment Escrow Account
       only to the extent that it is able to reasonably demonstrate that such
       sums will be applied towards the replacement, reinstatement and/or repair
       of the assets and/or the satisfaction of business interruption losses in
       respect of which the relevant insurance claim was made (or to refinance
       any expenditure incurred in the replacement, reinstatement and/or repair
       of such assets and/or the satisfaction of business interruption losses).
       Any sums not so withdrawn during such 365 day period shall thereafter be
       paid to the Agent and applied in repayment of the Revolving Loan in

       Indebtedness raised by members of the Covenant Group at any time after 31
       December 2003 (other than the proceeds of relevant Excluded
       Contributions), (such an amount being 662/3 per cent. of the amount
       contributed to the UK Group (other than the Parent) in accordance with
       sub-clause 19.22.3 of Clause 19.22 (Mandatory Contribution)) is applied
       in cancellation and repayment of the Revolving Loan in accordance with
       Clause 10.7 (Application of Proceeds).

<PAGE>   64
       10.6.1 the Agent shall notify the Parent that the Banks require all (or
              such lesser amount as specified by the relevant Instructing Group)
              of the proceeds of that Forced Draw to be deposited in the
              Prepayment Escrow Account and applied in repayment of the
              Revolving Loan in accordance with Clause 10.7 (Application of
              Proceeds);

       10.6.2 the Parent shall, upon receipt of the proceeds of that Forced Draw
              and to the extent specified in the notice received by it pursuant
              to sub-clause 10.6.1 above, deposit such proceeds in the
              Prepayment Escrow Account for application in repayment of the
              Revolving Loan in accordance with Clause 10.7 (Application of
              Proceeds); and

       10.6.3 if the Agent requires it to do so, the Parent shall direct the
              Working Capital Facility Agent to pay the relevant amount of the
              proceeds of that Forced Draw directly to the Agent.

              (a)    retained in the Prepayment Escrow Account pending any
                     withdrawal permitted by any of those Clauses; and

              (b)    if no such right of withdrawal is available, if it has
                     ceased to be available or if the Relevant Obligor so
                     instructs the Agent, be retained in the Prepayment Escrow
                     Account for application on one or more Repayment Dates

                     Clause 10.7.

              (Mandatory Prepayment from Excess Cash Flow) to 10.6 (Mandatory
              Prepayment from Forced Draw Proceeds) shall when required to be
              applied in repayment of the Revolving Loan in accordance with this
              Clause 10.7 (and then on the dates indicated in sub-clause 10.7.1
              above) be applied as follows:

              (a)    first, in repayment of the Revolving Loan (and a
                     corresponding cancellation of the Available Facility); and

              (b)    secondly, if any excess remains thereafter, in payment of
                     such excess to the relevant member of the UK Group or, as
                     the case may be, the Target Group and in cancellation of
                     the remaining Available Facility by an equal amount.

              Any amount of the Revolving Loan repaid in accordance with this
              Clause 10.7 may not be reborrowed and any cancellation of the
              Available Facility in accordance with this Clause 10.7 shall
              reduce the Commitment of each Bank rateably and the amount so
              cancelled may not be reborrowed.

       All payments to be made by an Obligor to any Finance Party under the
       Finance Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction
       for or on account of tax unless such Obligor is required by law to make
       such a payment subject to the deduction or withholding of tax, in which
       case the sum payable by such Obligor (in respect of which such deduction
       or withholding is required to be made) shall, subject to Clause 11.5
       (Excluded Claims), be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that
       such Finance Party receives a sum net of any deduction or withholding
       equal to the sum which it would have received had no such deduction or
       withholding been made or required to be made.

11.2   TAX INDEMNITY

       Without prejudice to Clause 11.1 (Tax Gross-up), if the Agent or (as a
       result of the introduction of, or change in or in the interpretation,
       administration or application of, any law or regulation or order or
       governmental rule or double taxation agreement or any published practice
       or concession of any relevant taxing authority after the date hereof) any

       relation to any sum received or receivable under the Finance Documents
       (including any sum deemed for purposes of tax to be received or
       receivable by such Finance Party whether or not actually received or
       receivable) or (b) has any liability in respect of any such payment

       shall, within five Business Days of demand by the Agent, promptly
       indemnify the Agent or Bank which suffers a loss or liability as a result
       against such payment or liability, together with any interest, penalties,
       costs and expenses payable or incurred in connection therewith, PROVIDED
       THAT this Clause 11.2 shall not apply to:

<PAGE>   67
       11.2.1 any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net income,
              profits or gains actually received or receivable by the Agent or
              such Bank (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any sum
              deemed for purposes of tax to be received or receivable by the
              Agent or such Bank but not actually receivable) by the
              jurisdiction in which the Agent or such Bank is incorporated or,
              if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which the
              Agent or such Bank is treated as resident for tax purposes; or

       11.2.2 any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net income,

              purposes of tax to be received or receivable by the Agent or such
              Bank but not actually receivable) by the jurisdiction in which its
              Facility Office is located; or

       11.2.3 any tax imposed on the Agent, as a result of the failure by a Bank
              to satisfy on the due date of a payment of interest either of the
              conditions set out in sub-clauses 11.3.1 and 11.3.2 of Clause 11.3
              (Banks' Tax Status Confirmation); or

       11.2.4 for the avoidance of doubt, any tax imposed on a Bank which would
              not have arisen but for the sub-participation of its rights and
              benefits under any of the Finance Documents.

11.3   BANKS' TAX STATUS CONFIRMATION

       Each Bank confirms in favour of the Agent (on the date hereof or, in the
       case of a Bank which becomes a party hereto pursuant to a transfer or
       assignment, on the date on which the relevant transfer or assignment
       becomes effective) that either:

       11.3.1 it is not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom and is
              beneficially entitled to its share of the Revolving Loan and the
              interest thereon; or

       11.3.2 it is a bank as defined for the purposes of Section 349 of ICTA
              and is beneficially entitled to its share of the Revolving Loan
              and the interest thereon,

       and each Bank shall promptly notify the Agent if there is any change in
       its position from that set out above.

11.4   CLAIMS BY BANKS AND THE AGENT

       A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 11.2 (Tax Indemnity)
       shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to the claim, whereupon
       the Agent shall notify the Relevant Obligor and the Borrowers thereof. If
       the Agent intends to make a claim pursuant to Clause 11.2 (Tax Indemnity)
       it shall notify the Relevant Obligor and the Borrowers of the event
       giving rise to the claim.

11.5   EXCLUDED CLAIMS

       If any Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender, no
       Obligor shall be liable to pay to that Finance Party under Clause 11.1
       (Tax Gross-Up) any amount in

                                      -64-
<PAGE>   68
       respect of taxes levied or imposed in excess of the amount it would have
       been obliged to pay if that Finance Party had been or had not ceased to
       be a Qualifying Lender PROVIDED THAT this Clause 11.5 shall not apply
       (and each Obligor shall be obliged to comply with its obligations under
       Clause 11.1 (Tax Gross-Up)) if:

       11.5.1 after the date hereof, there shall have been any introduction of,
              or change in or in the interpretation, administration or
              application of, any law or regulation or order or governmental
              rule or double taxation agreement or any published practice or
              concession of any relevant taxing authority and as a result
              thereof such Finance Party ceases to be a Qualifying Lender; or

       11.5.2 such Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender as a
              result of the actions of any Obligor.

11.6   TREATY LENDERS

       A Treaty Lender and each Obligor which makes a payment to which that
       Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any procedural
       formalities necessary for that Obligor to obtain authorisation to make
       that payment without a deduction or withholding for or on account of tax.
       If an Obligor is able to demonstrate that a deduction or withholding for
       or on account of tax is required to be made by it as a result of a Treaty
       Lender's failure to so co-operate, such an Obligor shall not be liable to
       pay any increased amount under Clause 11.1 (Tax Gross-Up) as a result of
       such a deduction or withholding.

11.7   NOTIFICATION OF STATUS

       Each Bank shall notify the Agent if it is not a Qualifying Lender at the
       time it becomes a Bank hereunder and shall promptly notify the Agent if
       at any time thereafter it ceases to be a Qualifying Lender. The Agent
       shall promptly notify the Relevant Obligor of any notices it receives
       under this Clause 11.7 and if it ceases to be a Qualifying Lender.

12.    TAX RECEIPTS

12.1   NOTIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT TO DEDUCT TAX

       If, at any time, an Obligor is required by law to make any deduction or
       withholding from any sum payable by it under the Finance Documents (or if
       thereafter there is any change in the rates at which or the manner in
       which such deductions or withholdings are calculated), such Obligor and
       the Bank to which such sum is payable shall promptly upon becoming aware
       of such a requirement notify the Agent accordingly. If the Agent receives
       such a notification from a Bank it shall promptly notify the Relevant
       Obligor and the Obligor who is required to make such a deduction or
       withholding.

12.2   EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT OF TAX

       If an Obligor makes any payment under the Finance Documents in respect of
       which it is required to make any deduction or withholding, it shall pay
       the full amount required to be deducted or withheld to the relevant
       taxation or other authority within the time allowed for such payment
       under applicable law and shall request and, within thirty days of it
       receiving the same, deliver to the Agent for each Bank an original
       receipt (or

       to such authority of all amounts so required to be deducted or withheld
       in respect of that Bank's share of such payment.

12.3   TAX CREDIT PAYMENT

       If an additional payment is made under Clause 11 (Taxes) by an Obligor
       for the benefit of any Finance Party and such Finance Party, in its sole
       discretion, determines that it has obtained (and has derived full use and
       benefit from) a credit against, a relief or remission for, or repayment
       of, any tax, then, if and to the extent that such Finance Party, in its
       sole opinion, determines that such credit, relief, remission or repayment
       is in respect of or calculated with reference to or otherwise relates to
       the additional payment made pursuant to Clause 11 (Taxes), such Finance
       Party shall, to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to the
       retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment,
       pay to such Obligor such amount as such Finance Party shall, in its sole
       opinion, determine to be the amount which will leave such Finance Party
       (after such payment) in no worse after-tax position than it would have
       been in had the additional payment in question not been required to be
       made by such Obligor.

12.4   TAX CREDIT CLAWBACK

       If any Finance Party makes any payment to an Obligor pursuant to Clause
       12.3 (Tax Credit Payment) and such Finance Party subsequently determines,
       in its sole opinion, that the credit, relief, remission or repayment in
       respect of which such payment was made was not available or has been
       withdrawn or that it was unable to use such credit, relief, remission or
       repayment in full, such Obligor shall reimburse such Finance Party such
       amount as such Finance Party determines, in its sole opinion, is
       necessary to place it in the same after-tax position as it would have
       been in if such credit, relief, remission or repayment had been obtained
       and fully used and retained by such Finance Party.

12.5   TAX AND OTHER AFFAIRS

       No provision of this Agreement shall interfere with the right of any
       Finance Party to arrange its tax or any other affairs in whatever manner
       it thinks fit, oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit, relief,
       remission or repayment in respect of any payment under Clause 11 (Taxes)
       in priority to any other credit, relief, remission or repayment available
       to it nor oblige any Finance Party to disclose any information relating
       to its tax or other affairs or any computations in respect thereof.

13.    INCREASED COSTS

       relating to the maintenance of capital or any other request from or
       requirement of any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other
       authority (in each case, where a request or requirement that does not

       13.1.1 a Bank or any holding company of such Bank is unable to obtain the
              rate of return on its capital which it would have been able to
              obtain but for such Bank's entering into or assuming or
              maintaining a commitment or performing its obligations under the
              Finance Documents;

       13.1.2 a Bank or any holding company of such Bank incurs a cost as a

              Documents; or

       13.1.3 there is any increase in the cost to a Bank or any holding company
              of such Bank of funding or maintaining such Bank's share of the
              Revolving Advances or any Unpaid Sum,

       three Business Days of a demand of the Agent, pay to the Agent for the
       account of that Bank amounts sufficient to indemnify that Bank or to
       enable that Bank to indemnify its holding company from and against, as

       (ii) such cost or (iii) such increased cost.

13.2   INCREASED COSTS CLAIMS

       A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 13.1 (Increased

              made by an Obligor and compensated for pursuant to the provisions
              of Clause 11.1 (Tax Gross-Up) (or would have been compensated for
              under Clause 11.1 (Tax Gross-Up) but was not so compensated solely
              because of Clause 11.5 (Excluded Claims) or Clause 11.6 (Treaty
              Lenders));

       13.3.2 compensated by Clause 11.2 (Tax Indemnity) (or would have been
              compensated for under Clause 11.2 (Tax Indemnity) but was not so
              compensated solely because of one of the exclusions set out in
              sub-clauses 11.2.1 to 11.2.4 of Clause 11.2 (Tax Indemnity));

       13.3.3 compensated by the Mandatory Cost Rate; or

14.    ILLEGALITY

       If, at any time, it is or will become unlawful for a Bank to make, fund
       or allow to remain outstanding all or part of its share of the Revolving
       Advances, then that Bank shall, promptly after becoming aware of the
       same, deliver to the Relevant Obligor through the Agent a notice to that
       effect and:

       14.1.1 such Bank shall not thereafter be obliged to participate in the
              making of any Revolving Advances and the amount of its Available
              Commitment shall be immediately reduced to zero; and

       14.1.2 if the Agent on behalf of such Bank so requires, each Borrower
              which has drawn a Revolving Advance shall no later than the last
              day permitted by law repay such Bank's share of any outstanding
              Revolving Advances together with accrued interest thereon and all
              other amounts owing to such Bank under the Finance Documents.

15.    MITIGATION

       If, in respect of any Bank, circumstances arise which would or would upon
       the giving of notice result in:

       15.1.1 an increase in any sum payable to it or for its account pursuant
              to Clause 11.1 (Tax Gross-up);

       15.1.2 a claim for indemnification pursuant to Clause 11.2 (Tax
              Indemnity) or Clause 13.1 (Increased Costs); or

       15.1.3 the reduction of its Available Commitment to zero or any repayment
              to be made pursuant to Clause 14 (Illegality),

       then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the
       rights of such Bank or the obligations of the Obligors or the Relevant
       Obligor under any of the Clauses referred to above, such Bank shall
       promptly upon becoming aware of such circumstances notify the Agent
       thereof and, in consultation with the Agent and the Relevant Obligor and
       to the extent that it can do so lawfully, take reasonable steps
       (including a change of location of its Facility Office or the transfer of
       its rights, benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents to
       another financial institution acceptable to the Relevant Obligor and
       willing to participate in the Revolving Facility) to mitigate the effects
       of such circumstances, PROVIDED THAT such Bank shall be under no
       obligation to take any such action if, in the opinion of such Bank, to do
       so might have any adverse effect upon its business, operations or
       financial condition (other than any minor costs and expenses of an
       administrative nature).

       The Parent:

       16.15.1 does not regard any of the forecasts or projections set out in
               the Business Plan as unreasonable or, to any material extent,
               unattainable;

       16.15.2 considers (having made all reasonable enquiries) the assumptions
               upon which the forecasts and projections contained in the
               Business Plan are based to be fair and reasonable in all material
               respects; and

       16.15.3 confirms that the factual information contained in the
               Information Memorandum and any other factual written information
               supplied by any member of the UK Group or any member of the
               Target Group (in the latter case, supplied after the Acquisition
               Date or, if supplied before the Acquisition Date, supplied with
               the Parent's knowledge) to the Agent, the Arrangers and the Banks

               supplied by any member of the Target Group, to the best of its
               knowledge and belief) true, complete and accurate in all material
               respects.

       It:

       16.16.1 regards (as at the date each Budget is delivered to the Agent) as

               any of the forecasts or projections set out in the latest Budget
               delivered under Clause 17.5 (Budgets);

       16.16.2 believes (having made all reasonable enquiries) the assumptions,
               upon which the forecasts and projections in relation to the CWC
               ConsumerCo Business contained in the latest Budget delivered
               under Clause 17.5 (Budgets) are based, to be fair and reasonable;
               and

       16.16.3 has, to the best of its knowledge and belief (having made all
               reasonable efforts to make due and careful enquiry), made full
               disclosure of all material facts relating to the CWC ConsumerCo
               Business to all the persons responsible for the preparing of the
               latest Budget delivered under Clause 17.5 (Budgets).

       knowledge and belief) is threatened against the Original Borrower, any

       Adverse Effect.

               or treaty to which it is party or which is binding upon it or any

       limitation, the Licences), permissions, authorisations and consents (each
       an "APPROVAL") required for the conduct of its business as carried on
       from time to time, and all such approvals are valid and subsisting save
       in any such case where failure to obtain such an approval or the
       invalidity of such an approval or its failure to subsist could not
       reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and to the best
       of its knowledge and belief (having made, with respect to the UK Group
       only, due and careful enquiry) there has been no act or omission on the
       part of it or, as the case may be, any Target Group member or any UK
       Group member, which is likely to give rise to the enforcement,
       revocation, material amendment, suspension, withdrawal or avoidance of
       any of the approvals or any of the material terms or conditions thereof,

16.26  SECURITY INTEREST

        16.26.1 Subject (in each case) to the Reservations, each Security
                Document creates the security interest which that Security
                Document purports to create or, if that Security Document
                purports to evidence a security interest, accurately evidences a
                security interest which has been validly created and each
                security interest ranks in priority (save in respect of, if and
                to the extent applicable, Permitted Encumbrances) as specified
                in the Security Document creating or evidencing that interest.

                Group or Target Group member which are subject to an Encumbrance
                under the Security Documents are fully paid and not subject to
                any option to purchase or similar rights and the constitutional
                documents of any such UK Group or Target Group member do not and
                could not restrict or inhibit (whether


                                      -75-

                absolutely, partly, under a discretionary power or otherwise)

                  constituting such Existing Target Indebtedness or the Existing
                  Performance Bonds or in any other document to which the CWC
                  Parent or any of its subsidiaries are party, or which is
                  binding on the CWC Parent or any of its subsidiaries (or any
                  of their assets) which will prevent compliance with Clause
                  19.17 (Post-Acquisition Date Security).

                  Documentation) of Schedule 10 (Additional Conditions
                  Precedent) PROVIDED THAT if any member of the Target Group is
                  a party to any agreement which prohibits or restricts the
                  creation of such security, the CWC Parent and the Original
                  Borrower shall only be obliged to procure that such member of

         Clause 19.32 (Guarantors) will continue to be satisfied and the written
         request from the Relevant Obligor confirms (with supporting evidence)

         Each of the CWC Parent, the Parent and the Original Borrower shall:

         19.19.1  procure that (subject to the release by the Security Trustee
                  of the Security, as contemplated in paragraph (a) of the
                  definition of Pushdown), as soon as reasonably practical after
                  and, in any event, no later than ten Business Days after the
                  Pushdown Condition is satisfied, steps (a) to (g) of the

                  the Target Group:

                  (a)      operates its business and utilises (or refrains from
                           utilising) the permissions and exceptions to the
                           covenants set out in this Clause 19 with the
                           overriding objective of allowing the Pushdown to
                           occur as soon as is reasonably practicable after the

                           limitation, those provided by the definitions of

                           thing in reliance upon such permission or exception,
                           such transaction or thing could be reasonably
                           expected to delay the Pushdown.

19.20    UNWINDING OF ACTIONS

         If, at any time:

         19.20.1  it is reasonably likely that by doing so it will enable

                  could otherwise occur; and

         19.20.2  if the Agent (acting on the instructions of an Instructing

         19.22.1  to the extent that such amount is required, pursuant to the
                  Working Capital Facility to be applied in mandatory prepayment
                  of the amount outstanding thereunder, such amount shall be
                  invested in the Parent by way of Subordinated Funding and so

                  under the Working Capital Facility;

         19.22.2  to the extent that such amount is required, pursuant to the

                  shall be invested in the Parent by way of Subordinated Funding
                  and onlent by way of Parent Funding to members of the UK Group

                  Working Capital Facility to be applied in mandatory prepayment
                  or cancellation thereof:

                  (a)      from the Acquisition Date up to (and including) 31
                           December 2003, 662/3 per cent. of the aggregate
                           amount of such cash proceeds; and

                  (b)      at all times thereafter, 75 per cent. of the
                           aggregate amount of such cash proceeds,

         in each case other than Excluded Contributions, shall be contributed to
         the Parent by way of Subordinated Funding. The Parent shall in turn
         ensure that any such Subordinated Funding received by it is contributed
         to the other members of the UK Group by way of Parent Funding.

                  19.17.1 of Clause 19.17 (Post Acquisition Date Security), at
                  all times the aggregate EBITDA of the Guarantors (in each case

                           Date, shall be equal to the aggregate EBITDA of the
                           Guarantors or, as the case may be the aggregate
                           EBITDA of the UK Group for that Financial Quarter,

                           Pushdown Date, shall be equal to the aggregate EBITDA
                           of the Guarantors or, as the case may be the
                           aggregate EBITDA of the UK Group for the immediately
                           preceding four complete Financial Quarters.

         19.32.4  A breach of this Clause 19.32 shall not constitute an Event of
                  Default if (i) one or more subsidiaries of the Parent or, as
                  the case may be, the CWC Parent become Guarantors (in
                  accordance with Clause 34 (Accession of Guarantors and the CWC
                  Parent)), within five Business Days of the earlier of notice
                  by the Agent to the Relevant Obligor of the breach and the
                  Relevant Obligor becoming aware thereof and (ii) the Agent
                  (acting reasonably) is satisfied that this Clause 19.32 will,
                  as a result of the Guarantors thereby created, be satisfied.

         No Obligor shall, the Parent shall procure that no member of the UK
         Group shall and the CWC Parent (on and after the date on which it

<PAGE>   104
         19.33.1  those shares are subject to the Security; and

         19.33.2  such an alteration would be reasonably likely to prejudice the

                  the Security over the company represented by those shares.

                           above between members of the Group where such are
                           otherwise permitted by this Agreement;

                  available market by which to assess whether such a transaction
                  is on no worse than arms' length terms, on terms such that in
                  the reasonable opinion of the Parent the transaction is

                  Group or, as the case may be, member of the Target Group;

                  arrangements, PROVIDED THAT the consideration for the
                  provision of such agency arrangements is, in the reasonable
                  opinion of the Parent, no less than the cost (save in any
                  immaterial respect) incurred by Cable & Wireless
                  Communications Services Limited in providing such services;

         19.34.5  transactions to effect either an Asset Passthrough or a

                  cost incurred by the relevant Obligor, member of the UK Group
                  or, as the case may be, member of the Target Group in
                  providing such Excess Capacity Network Services; and

         19.36.2  in the case of the CWC Parent and the Target, a change so that

20.      EVENTS OF DEFAULT

         Each of Clause 20.1 (Failure to Pay) to Clause 20.17 (Material Adverse
         Change) describes circumstances which constitute an Event of Default
         for the purposes of this Agreement. Clause 20.18 (Acceleration and
         Cancellation) and Clause 20.19 (Revolving Advances Due on Demand) deal
         with the rights of the Agent and the Banks after the occurrence of an
         Event of Default.

20.1     FAILURE TO PAY

         Any of the Obligors fails to pay any sum due from it under any of the
         Finance Documents to which it is a party at the time, in the currency
         and in the manner specified therein unless:

         20.1.1   the sum is of a principal amount which was not paid as a
                  result of a technical error or failure in the transmission of
                  funds and that payment is then received by the Agent within
                  one Business Day of the due date;

         20.1.2   the sum is of an amount of interest and that payment is then
                  received by the Agent within three Business Days of the due
                  date; or

         20.1.3   the sum is of an amount other than principal or interest and
                  that payment is then received by the Agent within five
                  Business Days of the due date.

20.2     MISREPRESENTATION

         Any representation or statement made or repeated by NTL CC, the Parent,
         the CWC Parent or any Obligor in any of the Finance Documents or in any
         notice or other document or certificate delivered by it pursuant
         thereto or in connection therewith is or proves to have been incorrect
         or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be made
         and the circumstances giving rise to such inaccuracy, if capable of
         remedy or change, are not remedied or do not change, such that the
         relevant representation or statement would be correct and not
         misleading if repeated five Business Days after the earlier of (a) it
         being notified by the Agent to NTL CC in the case of a representation
         or statement by NTL CC, and to the Group Representative in all other
         cases, as having been made inaccurately and (b) NTL CC, the Parent, the
         CWC Parent or the relevant Obligor becoming aware of such inaccuracy.

20.3     SPECIFIC COVENANTS

         NTL CC, the Parent, the CWC Parent or any of the Obligors fails to
         comply with any of its obligations under Clause 17 (Financial
         Information) or Clause 19 (Covenants). No Event of Default under this
         Clause 20.3 (Specific Covenants) shall occur in relation to:

         20.3.1   Clause 17.1 (Annual Statements) to Clause 17.9 (Other
                  Financial Information) or Clause 17.11 (General Information)
                  to Clause 17.13 (Acquisition Information), if the failure to
                  comply with such is remedied within five Business Days of the
                  Agent giving notice thereof to the Group Representative;

<PAGE>   108
         20.3.2   Clause 19 (Covenants), if the failure to comply with such is
                  capable of remedy and is remedied within five Business Days of
                  the date on which NTL CC, the Parent, the CWC Parent or, as
                  the case may be, the relevant Obligor became aware of such
                  failure to comply PROVIDED THAT a breach of any of the
                  obligations under Clause 19.2 (Claims Pari Passu), Clause 19.3

                  Investments), Clause 19.30 (Mergers), Clause 19.34
                  (Transactions with Affiliates) and Clause 19.40 (Voluntary

         22.3.3   The average daily Commitments during a Commitment Period shall
                  equal the aggregate of the Commitments on each day during such

                  Period shall equal the aggregate of the Available Commitments

                  number of days in such Commitment Period.

22.4     PAYMENT OF COMMITMENT COMMISSION

         The Agent shall promptly after the end of each Commitment Period notify

24.2     DEFAULT INTEREST

         An Unpaid Sum shall bear interest during each Term in respect thereof

         (acting through the Relevant Obligor) shall pay to the Agent on demand
         for account of such Bank an amount equal to the amount (if any) by

         amount so received or recovered had it been received or recovered on
         the last day of that Term

         of any set-off or counterclaim.

27.5     CLAWBACK

         Where a sum is to be paid hereunder to the Agent for account of another
         person, the Agent shall not be obliged to make the same available to

         satisfaction that it has actually received such sum, but if it does so
         and it proves to be the case that it had not actually received such
         sum, then the person to whom such sum was so made available shall on
         request refund the same to the Agent together with an amount sufficient
         to indemnify the Agent against any cost or loss it may have suffered or
         incurred by reason of its having paid out such sum prior to its having
         received such sum.

         under this Agreement in the following order:

27.7     VARIATION OF PARTIAL PAYMENTS

         The order of partial payments set out in Clause 27.6 (Partial Payments)
         shall override any appropriation made by the Obligor to which the
         partial payment relates but the order set out in sub-clauses 27.6.2,
         27.6.3 and 27.6.4 of Clause 27.6 (Partial Payments) may be varied if
         agreed by all the Banks.

28.      SET-OFF

28.1     CONTRACTUAL SET-OFF

         Each Obligor authorises each Bank, at any time any sum is due and
         payable hereunder and remains unpaid, to apply any credit balance to
         which such Obligor is entitled on any account of such Obligor with such
         Bank in satisfaction of any sum due and payable from such Obligor to
         such Bank under the Finance Documents but unpaid. For this purpose,
         each Bank is authorised to purchase with the moneys standing to the
         credit of any such account such other currencies as may be necessary to
         effect such application.

28.2     SET-OFF NOT MANDATORY
         No Bank shall be obliged to exercise any right given to it by Clause

29.      SHARING

29.1     PAYMENTS TO BANKS

         If a Bank (a "RECOVERING BANK") applies any receipt or recovery from an
         Obligor to a payment due under this Agreement and such amount is
         received or recovered other than in accordance with Clause 27
         (Payments), then such Recovering Bank shall:

         29.1.1   notify the Agent of such receipt or recovery;

         29.1.2   at the request of the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent an
                  amount (the "SHARING PAYMENT") equal to such receipt or
                  recovery less any amount which the Agent determines may be
                  retained by such Recovering Bank as its share of any payment
                  to be made in accordance with Clause 27.6 (Partial Payments).

29.2     REDISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS

         The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the
         relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other
         than the Recovering Bank) in accordance with Clause 27.6 (Partial
         Payments).

29.3     RECOVERING BANK'S RIGHTS

         The Recovering Bank will be subrogated into the rights of the parties
         which have shared in a redistribution pursuant to Clause 29.2
         (Redistribution of Payments) in respect of the Sharing Payment (and the
         relevant Obligor shall be liable to the Recovering Bank in an amount
         equal to the Sharing Payment).

29.4     REPAYABLE RECOVERIES

         If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a
         Recovering Bank becomes repayable and is repaid by such Recovering
         Bank, then:

         29.4.1   each party which has received a share of such Sharing Payment
                  pursuant to Clause 29.2 (Redistribution of Payments) shall,
                  upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for account of
                  such Recovering Bank an amount equal to its share of such
                  Sharing Payment; and


                                     -120-
<PAGE>   124
         29.4.2   such Recovering Bank's rights of subrogation in respect of any
                  reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant Obligor will
                  be liable to the reimbursing party for the amount so
                  reimbursed.

29.5     EXCEPTION

         This Clause 29 shall not apply if the Recovering Bank would not, after
         making any payment pursuant hereto, have a valid and enforceable claim
         against the relevant Obligor.

29.6     RECOVERIES THROUGH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         If any Bank intends to commence any action in any court it shall give
         prior notice to the Agent and the other Banks. If any Bank shall
         commence any action in any court to enforce its rights hereunder and,
         as a result thereof or in connection therewith, receives any amount,
         then such Bank shall not be required to share any portion of such
         amount with any Bank which has the legal right to, but does not, join
         in such action or commence and diligently prosecute a separate action
         to enforce its rights in another court.

                  in it as agent hereunder unless and until instructed by an
                  Instructing Group as to whether or not such right, power or
                  discretion is to be exercised and, if it is to be exercised,
                  as to the manner in which it should be exercised;

         The Agent shall:

         30.3.1   promptly inform each Bank of the contents of any written
                  notice or document received by it in its capacity as Agent

         it under the Finance Documents and the performance of its duties in
         accordance therewith, and such delegation, transfer or assignment may
         be made upon such terms and subject to such conditions (including the
         power to sub-delegate) and subject to such regulations as the Agent may
         think fit (and the term "Agent" as used in this Agreement shall include
         any such delegate).

30.6     INDEMNIFICATION

         Each Bank shall, in its Proportion, from time to time on demand by the
         Agent, indemnify the Agent against any and all costs, claims, losses,

         thereon which the Agent may incur, otherwise than by reason of its own
         gross negligence or wilful misconduct, in acting in

                                     -123-

         have been reimbursed by the Borrowers pursuant to Clause 25.1
         (Borrowers' Indemnity)).

30.7     EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES

         Each Bank confirms that it has read the Notice to Recipients in the
         Information Memorandum, that it has complied with the Recipients'
         Obligations (as set out in the Notice to Recipients) and, accordingly,
         that it enters into this Agreement on the basis of the Notice to
         Recipients. In particular, each of the Banks accepts that it is
         entering into this Agreement in reliance only on the representations of
         the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC and the Obligors in this Agreement
         and on its own investigations, that it has not relied on the Arrangers
         and that, except as set out below, it neither has nor will have any
         claims against the Arrangers arising from or in connection with this
         Agreement. Similarly, each of the Banks accepts that the Notice to
         Recipients in the Information Memorandum is applicable also to the
         Agent as if the Agent had been named in addition to the Arrangers in
         the Important Notice.

         Except in the case of gross negligence or wilful default, neither the
         Agent nor any Arranger accepts any responsibility to any of the Banks:

         30.7.1   for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the
                  Information Memorandum or any other information supplied by
                  the Agent or the Arrangers, by the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL
                  CC or an Obligor or by any other person in connection with the
                  Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or
                  document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,
                  pursuant to or in connection with the Finance Documents;

         30.7.2   for the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with
                  the Finance Documents; or

         30.7.3   for the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any
                  judgement, discretion or power given to any of them by or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents or any other agreement,
                  arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
                  anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with the Finance
                  Documents.

         Accordingly, neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall be under any
         liability (whether in negligence or otherwise) in respect of such
         matters, save in the case of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

30.8     NO ACTIONS

         Each of the Banks agrees that it will not assert or seek to assert
         against any director, officer or employee of the Agent or the Arrangers
         any claim it might have against any of them in respect of the matters
         referred to in Clause 30.7 (Exclusion of Liabilities).

30.9     BUSINESS WITH THE GROUP

         The Agent and the Arrangers may accept deposits from, lend money to and
         generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with any
         member of the Group whether or not it may or does lead to a conflict
         with the interests of any of the Banks. Similarly, the Agent or the
         Arrangers may undertake business with or for others even though it may
         lead to a conflict with the interests of any of the Banks.

30.10    RESIGNATION

         The Agent may resign its appointment hereunder at any time without
         assigning any reason therefor by giving not less than thirty days'
         prior notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto,
         PROVIDED THAT no such resignation shall be effective until a successor
         for the Agent is appointed in accordance with the succeeding provisions
         of this Clause 30.

30.11    REMOVAL OF AGENT

         An Instructing Group may, after consultation with the Relevant Obligor,
         remove the Agent from its role as agent under the Finance Documents by
         giving notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto. Such
         removal shall take effect only when a successor to the Agent is
         appointed in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents.

30.12    SUCCESSOR AGENT

         If the Agent gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Clause 30.10
         (Resignation) or it is removed pursuant to Clause 30.11 (Removal of
         Agent), then any reputable and experienced bank or other financial
         institution may, with the prior consent of the Relevant Obligor be
         appointed as a successor to the Agent by an Instructing Group during
         the period of such notice but, if no such successor is so appointed,
         the Agent may appoint such a successor itself.

30.13    RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

         If a successor to the Agent is appointed under the provisions of Clause
         30.12 (Successor Agent), then (a) the retiring or departing Agent shall
         be discharged from any further obligation under the Finance Documents
         but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the provisions of this
         Clause 30 and (b) its successor and each of the other parties hereto
         shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they
         would have had if such successor had been a party hereto.

30.14    OWN RESPONSIBILITY

         It is understood and agreed by each Bank that at all times it has
         itself been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its
         own independent appraisal of and investigation into all risks arising
         under or in connection with the Finance Documents including, but not
         limited to:

         30.14.1  the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition, affairs,
                  status and nature of each member of the Group;

         30.14.2  the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy and
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents and any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into,

                                     -125-
<PAGE>   129
                  made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents;

         30.14.3  whether such Bank has recourse, and the nature and extent of
                  that recourse, against an Obligor or any other person or any
                  of their respective assets under or in connection with the
                  Finance Documents, the transactions therein contemplated or
                  any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into,
                  made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents; and

         30.14.4  the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the Information
                  Memorandum and any other information provided by the Agent or
                  the Arrangers, the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC or an
                  Obligor or by any other person in connection with the Finance
                  Documents, the transactions contemplated therein or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with
                  the Finance Documents.

         Accordingly, each Bank acknowledges to the Agent and the Arrangers that
         it has not relied on and will not hereafter rely on the Agent and the
         Arrangers or any of them in respect of any of these matters.

30.15    BANKS' MANDATORY COST DETAILS

         Each Bank will supply the Agent with such information and in such
         detail as the Agent may require in order to calculate the Mandatory
         Cost Rate in accordance with Schedule 12 (Mandatory Costs).

30.16    RECEIPT OF INFORMATION BY THE AGENT

         Any information or document received by the Agent shall only be treated
         as having been received by the Agent if the same has been delivered to
         the Agent's agency department in accordance with Clause 37 (Notices).
         Accordingly, any information or documents received by the Agent other
         than by its agency department in accordance with Clause 37 (Notices) is
         not by reason of that receipt to be treated as having been received by
         the Agent unless and until the Agent's agency department has received
         actual notice of the same in accordance with such Clause. Save as
         expressly set out in this Agreement and, unless the Agent's agency
         department shall have received information or documents in accordance
         with Clause 37 (Notices) the Agent shall have no duty to disclose, and
         shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information or
         documents, that are communicated to or obtained by the Agent.

31.      ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS

31.1     BINDING AGREEMENT

         each party hereto and its or any subsequent successors and Transferees.

         obligations under the Finance

                                     -126-
<PAGE>   130
         Documents, other than as permitted pursuant to the terms of this
         Agreement PROVIDED THAT the Original Borrower may novate its rights and
         obligations under the Finance Documents to NTLIH pursuant to the
         implementation of the Pushdown.

31.3     ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFERS BY BANKS

         31.3.1   Any Bank may, at any time, assign all or any of its rights and
                  benefits hereunder or transfer in accordance with Clause 31.5
                  (Transfers by Banks) all or any of its rights, benefits and
                  obligations hereunder to, or enter into any form of
                  sub-participation agreement with, a bank or financial
                  institution.

         31.3.2   The prior written consent of the Relevant Obligor (which shall
                  be deemed to be given on its own behalf and on behalf of the
                  other Obligors) is required for an assignment or transfer by a
                  Bank unless the assignment or transfer is to:

                  (a)      another Bank; or

                  (b)      any subsidiary or holding company (or to any
                           subsidiary of any holding company) of the
                           transferring Bank.

         31.3.3   The Relevant Obligor's consent must not be (a) unreasonably
                  delayed or withheld or (b) withheld solely because the
                  assignment or transfer may result in an increase to the
                  Mandatory Cost Rate.

31.4     ASSIGNMENTS BY BANKS

         If any Bank assigns all or any of its rights and benefits under the
         Finance Documents in accordance with Clause 31.3 (Assignments and
         Transfers by Banks), then, unless and until the assignee has delivered
         a notice to the Agent confirming in favour of the Agent, the Arrangers
         and the other Banks that it shall be under the same obligations towards
         each of them as it would have been under if it had been an original
         party hereto as a Bank (whereupon such assignee shall become a party
         hereto as a "Bank"), the Agent, the Arrangers and the other Banks shall
         not be obliged to recognise such assignee as having the rights against
         each of them which it would have had if it had been such a party
         hereto.

31.5     TRANSFERS BY BANKS

         If any Bank wishes to transfer all or any of its rights, benefits
         and/or obligations under the Finance Documents as contemplated in
         Clause 31.3 (Assignments and Transfers by Banks), then such transfer
         may be effected by the delivery to the Agent of a duly completed
         Transfer Certificate executed by such Bank and the relevant Transferee
         in which event, on the later of the Transfer Date specified in such
         Transfer Certificate and the fifth Business Day after (or such earlier
         Business Day endorsed by the Agent on such Transfer Certificate falling
         on or after) the date of delivery of such Transfer Certificate to the
         Agent:

         31.5.1   to the extent that in such Transfer Certificate the Bank party
                  thereto seeks to transfer by novation its rights, benefits and
                  obligations under the Finance Documents, the Parent, the CWC
                  Parent, NTL CC and each of the Obligors and such Bank shall be
                  released from further obligations towards one another

                                     -127-
<PAGE>   131
                  under the Finance Documents and their respective rights
                  against one another shall be cancelled (such rights and
                  obligations being referred to in this Clause 31.5 as
                  "DISCHARGED RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS");

         31.5.2   the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC and each of the Obligors
                  and the Transferee party thereto shall assume obligations
                  towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another
                  which differ from such discharged rights and obligations only
                  insofar as the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC, the Obligors
                  and such Transferee have assumed and/or acquired the same in
                  place of the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC the Obligors and
                  such Bank;

         31.5.3   the Agent, the Arrangers, such Transferee and the other Banks
                  shall acquire the same rights and benefits and assume the same
                  obligations between themselves as they would have acquired and
                  assumed had such Transferee been an original party hereto as a
                  Bank with the rights, benefits and/or obligations acquired or
                  assumed by it as a result of such transfer and to that extent
                  the Agent, the Arrangers and the relevant Bank shall each be
                  released from further obligations to each other under the
                  Finance Documents; and

         31.5.4   such Transferee shall become a party hereto as a "BANK".

31.6     NO INCREASED OBLIGATIONS

         If:

         31.6.1   a Bank assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations
                  under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office;
                  and

         31.6.2   as a result of circumstances existing at the date of the
                  assignment, transfer or change of Facility Office, an Obligor
                  would be obliged to make a payment to the assignee, Transferee
                  or the Bank acting through its new Facility Office under
                  Clause 11.1 (Tax Gross-up), Clause 11.2 (Tax Indemnity) or
                  Clause 13 (Increased Costs),

         then the assignee, Transferee or the Bank acting through its new
         Facility Office shall only be entitled to receive payment under those
         Clauses to the same extent as the assignor, transferor or the Bank
         acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the
         assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.

31.7     ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER FEES

         On the date upon which an assignment takes effect pursuant to Clause
         31.4 (Assignments by Banks) or a transfer takes effect pursuant to
         Clause 31.5 (Transfers by Banks), in each case where such an assignment
         or transfer takes effect after the Syndication Date, the relevant
         assignee or Transferee shall pay to the Agent for its own account a fee
         of L1,000.

         31.8.2, the person to whom such information is to be given has entered
         into a Confidentiality Undertaking. Any Bank which discloses any such

31.10    MORGAN STANLEY COMMITMENT

         References to the Commitment of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Bank Limited

40.      GOVERNING LAW

         This Agreement is governed by English law.

41.      JURISDICTION

41.1     ENGLISH COURTS

         The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute
         (a "DISPUTE") arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
         (including a dispute regarding the existence, validity or termination
         of this Agreement or the consequences of its nullity).

41.2     CONVENIENT FORUM

         The parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate
         and convenient courts to settle Disputes between them and, accordingly,
         that they will not argue to the contrary.

41.3     NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION

         This Clause 41 is for the benefit of the Finance Parties only. As a
         result and notwithstanding Clause 41.1 (English Courts), it does not
         prevent any Finance Party from taking proceedings relating to a Dispute
         ("PROCEEDINGS") in any other courts with jurisdiction. To the extent
         allowed by law, the Finance Parties may take concurrent Proceedings in
         any number of jurisdictions.

41.4     SERVICE OF PROCESS

         NTL CC agrees that the documents which start any Proceedings and any
         other documents required to be served in relation to those Proceedings
         may be served on it by service of such documents on NTL Group Limited
         at NTL House, Bartley Wood Business Park, Hook, Hampshire RG27 9XA
         (marked for the attention of Robert Mackenzie) or, if different, its
         registered office.

         If NTL Group Limited ceases to have a place of business in Great
         Britain or, as the case may be, its appointment ceases to be effective,
         NTL CC shall immediately appoint another person in England to accept
         service of process on its behalf in England. If NTL CC fails to do so
         (and such failure continues for a period of not less than fourteen
         days), the Agent shall be entitled to appoint such a person by notice
         to NTL CC. Nothing contained herein shall restrict the right to serve
         process in any other manner allowed by law. This Clause 41.4 applies to
         Proceedings in England and to Proceedings elsewhere.

                                  SCHEDULE 12

                                 MANDATORY COSTS

1.     The Mandatory Cost Rate is an addition to the interest rate to compensate
       Banks for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of
       England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any
       other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the
       requirements of the European Central Bank.

2.     On the first day of each Term (or as soon as possible thereafter) the
       Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "ADDITIONAL
       COSTS RATE") for each Bank, in accordance with the formula set out below.
       The Mandatory Cost Rate will be calculated by the Agent as a weighted
       average of the Banks' additional costs rates rounded to five decimal
       places (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each
       Bank in the relevant Revolving Advance) and will be expressed as a
       percentage rate per annum.

3.     The additional costs rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office in
       a Participating Member State will be notified by that Bank to the Agent
       as the cost of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the
       European Central Bank.

4.     The additional cost rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office in
       the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Agent as follows:

               AB+C(B-D)+Ex0.01
            ________________________   per cent. per annum.
                  100-(A+C)
       Where:

       A      is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in
              excess of any stated minimum) which that Bank is from time to time
              required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with
              the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.

       B      is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Margin and the
              Mandatory Cost Rate) payable for the relevant Term on the
              Revolving Loan.

       C      is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Bank
              is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing
              Special Deposits with the Bank of England.

       D      is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to
              the Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.

       E      is the rate of charge payable by that Bank to the Financial
              Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Regulations (but, for this
              purpose, ignoring any minimum fee required pursuant to the Fees
              Regulations) and expressed in pounds per L1,000,000 of the Fee
              Base of that Bank.


                                     -174-
<PAGE>   178
5.     For the purposes of this Schedule:

       (a)    "ELIGIBLE LIABILITIES" and "SPECIAL DEPOSITS" have the meanings
              given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of
              England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of
              England;

       (b)    "FEES REGULATIONS" means the Banking Supervision (Fees)
              Regulations 1999 or such other law or regulation as may be in
              force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for
              banking supervision; and

       (c)    "FEE BASE" has the meaning given to it, and will be calculated in
              accordance with, the Fees Regulations.

6.     In application of the above formula, A, B, C and D will be included in
       the formula as percentages (i.e. 5 per cent. will be included in the
       formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting
       D from B shall be taken as zero.

7.     Each Bank shall supply any information required by the Agent for the
       purpose of calculating its additional costs rate. In particular, but
       without limitation, each Bank shall supply the following information in
       writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank:

       (a)    its jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction of its
              Facility Office; and

       (b)    such other information that the Agent may reasonably require for
              such purpose.

       Each Bank shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of any change to the
       information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.

8.     The percentages or rates of charge of each Bank for the purpose of A, C
       and E above shall be determined by the Agent based upon the information
       supplied to it pursuant to paragraph 7 above and on the assumption that
       unless a Bank notifies the Agent to the contrary, each Bank's obligations
       in relation to cash ratio deposits, Special Deposits and the Fee
       Regulations are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction
       of incorporation with a Facility Office in the same jurisdiction as its
       Facility Office.

       The Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination
       results in an additional costs rate which over or under compensates any
       Bank and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any
       Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 7 above is true and correct in all
       respects.

9.     The Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received pursuant to
       the Mandatory Cost Rate to the Banks on basis of the additional cost rate
       incurred by each Bank, as calculated in accordance with the above formula
       and based on the information provided by each Bank pursuant to paragraphs
       3 and 7 above.


                                     -175-
<PAGE>   179
10.    Any determination by the Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a
       formula, the Mandatory Cost Rate, an additional costs rate or any amount
       payable to a Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive
       and binding on all of the parties hereto.

11.    The Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Parent (on
       behalf of the Borrowers) and the Banks, determine and notify to all
       parties any amendments or variations which are required to be made to
       this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or
       any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the
