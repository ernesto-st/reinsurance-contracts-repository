         and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, and subject to the
         conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as
         follows:

                  SECTION 1.        Amendment and Restatement of the Existing
         Credit Agreement. The Existing Credit Agreement (excluding the annexes,
         schedules and exhibits thereto that are not attached as part of Exhibit
         A hereto) is hereby amended and restated, effective as of the
         Restatement Effective Date (as defined in Section 6 hereof), to read in

         contemplated hereby. From and after the effectiveness of such amendment
         and restatement, the terms "Agreement", "this Agreement", "herein",
         "hereinafter", "hereto", "hereof" and words of similar import, as used

                                                                               2

         Credit Agreement as amended and restated in the form of the Restated
         Credit Agreement, and the term "Credit Agreement", as used in the other
         Loan Documents, shall mean the Restated Credit Agreement. All Tranche A
         Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans, Tranche C Term Loans, Tranche D Term
         Loans, Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit
         outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Restatement
         Effective Date (to the extent not repaid) shall continue to be
         outstanding under the Restated Credit Agreement and the terms of the
         Restated Credit Agreement shall govern the rights of the Lenders and
         the Issuing Bank with respect thereto.

                  SECTION 2.        Conversion of Revolving Loans. On the
         Restatement Effective Date, upon the effectiveness of the Restated
         Credit Agreement pursuant to Section 1, Revolving Loans outstanding
         under the Existing Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of
         $62,500,000 shall be automatically converted into an equivalent amount
         of Tranche R Term Loans. Such conversion shall be deemed to permanently
         reduce the Revolving Commitments in an amount equal to $62,500,000 and
         shall be made ratably among the Revolving Lenders in accordance with
         their respective Revolving Commitments. The Borrower shall elect, by
         notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Restatement
         Effective Date, which outstanding Revolving Borrowing or Revolving
         Borrowings (or portion thereof) shall be so converted. Such conversion
         shall not affect accrual interest on any Borrowing or Borrowings so
         converted or terminate any Interest Period in effect at the time.

                  SECTION 3.        Waiver of Notice. The Lenders party hereto
         hereby waive any provision of the Restated Credit Agreement that
         requires the Borrower to give prior written notice of a prepayment of
         Term Loans or a reduction of Revolving Commitments, to the extent
         notice of prepayment is required in connection with application of the
         Net Proceeds of the issuance of the First Lien Notes in accordance with
         the Restated Credit Agreement or notice of reduction of Revolving
         Commitments is required with respect to the reduction of Revolving
         Commitments pursuant to Section 2.

                  SECTION 4.        Amendment of Security Documents; Collateral
         Sharing Agreement. Each Lender party hereto hereby (a) authorizes the
         Collateral Agent to execute and deliver any amendments or modifications
         to the Security Documents that the Collateral Agent determines to be
         necessary or appropriate to permit the Liens granted thereunder to
         secure the First Lien Notes equally and ratably with the Obligations,
         (b) consents to all such amendments or modifications and (c) authorizes
         the Collateral Agent to enter into a Collateral Sharing Agreement that
         will be binding on the Lenders; provided that such amendments or
         modifications to the Security Documents and such Collateral Sharing
         Agreement shall not become effective prior to the Restatement Effective
         Date.

                  SECTION 5.        Representations and Warranties. Each of
         Holdings and the Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative
         Agent and to each of the Lenders that:

                  (a) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
         delivered by each of Holdings and the Borrower and constitutes a legal,
         valid and binding obligation of Holdings and the Borrower, enforceable
         in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
         insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
         creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
         equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
         at law.

         the Borrower set forth in the Loan Documents is true and correct on and

               Administrative Agent;

                  (e) the Security Documents shall have been amended and
               modified as contemplated by Section 4 of this Agreement and such
               amendment and modifications shall be reasonably satisfactory in

         in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original
         but all of which when taken together shall constitute but one
         agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
         facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually

         Supplemental Interest accrued prior to March 31, 2003, that remains
         unpaid on March 31, 2003 (giving effect to any payments made on March

         Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for insurance by such Corporation
         of time deposits made in dollars at the offices of such member in the
         United States, provided that if, as a result of any change in any law,
         rule or regulation, it is no longer possible to determine the

         annual rate as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent to be

               months ending on June 30, 2000, and (B) a fraction the numerator
               of which is 12 and the denominator of which is 11.

                                   The Credits

                  SECTION 2.01.     Commitments. Subject to the terms and
         conditions set forth herein, each Revolving Lender agrees to make
         Revolving Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the Revolving
         Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not
         result in such Lender's Revolving Exposure exceeding such Lender's
         Revolving Commitment. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the
         terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay
         and reborrow Revolving

                                                                              33

         Loans. Amounts repaid or prepaid in respect of Term Loans may not be
         reborrowed. All Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans, Tranche C
         Term Loans, Tranche D Term Loans, Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit
         outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Restatement
         Effective Date shall remain outstanding hereunder on the terms set
         forth herein.

                  SECTION 2.02.     Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Loan (other
         than a Swingline Loan) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting
         of Loans of the same Class and Type made by the Lenders ratably in
         accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class.
         The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it
         shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder,
         provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender
         shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as
         required.

                  (b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing and Term
         Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans
         as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith, provided that all
         Borrowings made on the Effective Date shall be ABR Borrowings. Each
         Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. Each Lender at its option may make
         any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or
         Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan, provided that (i) any
         exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower
         to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
         (ii) the Borrower shall not be required to make any greater payment
         under Section 2.17 to the applicable Lender than such Lender would have
         been entitled to receive if such Lender had not exercised such option.

                  (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any
         Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount
         that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
         $10,000,000. At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made,
         such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
         multiple of $500,000 and not less than $10,000,000, provided that an
         ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to
         the entire unused balance of the total Revolving Commitments or that is
         required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
         contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Each Swingline Loan shall be in an
         amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than
         $500,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding
         at the same time, provided that there shall not at any time be more
         than a total of six Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding with respect to
         any Tranche of Borrowings.

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
         Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or
         continue, any Revolving Loan, Tranche A Term Loan, Tranche B Term Loan,
         Tranche C Term Loan, Tranche D Term Loan or Tranche R Term Loan if the
         Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the
         Revolving Maturity Date, Tranche A Maturity Date, Tranche B Maturity
         Date, Tranche C Maturity Date, Tranche D Maturity Date or Tranche R
         Maturity Date, respectively.

                  SECTION 2.03.     Requests for Borrowings. To request a
         Revolving Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent
         of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing,
         not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days
         before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in

<PAGE>

                                                                              34

         the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City
         time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic
         Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly
         by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written
         Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and
         signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing
         Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
         Section 2.02:

                  (i) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;

                  (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business
               Day;

                  (iii) subject to the proviso to the first sentence of Section
               2.02(b), whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
               Eurodollar Borrowing;

                  (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial
               Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
               contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

                  (vi) the location and number of the Borrower's account to
               which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
               requirements of Section 2.06.

         If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the
         requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is
         specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing,
         then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period
         of one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing
         Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall
         advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such
         Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.04.     Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms
         and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make
         Swingline Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the Revolving
         Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time
         outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount
         of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $25,000,000 or (ii) the sum of
         the total Revolving Exposures exceeding the total Revolving
         Commitments, provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required
         to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan.
         Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set
         forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline
         Loans.

                  (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the
         Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by
         telecopy), not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of
         a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and
         shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and
         amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will
         promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from
         the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan
         available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit
         account of the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a
         Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement
         as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to

<PAGE>

                                                                              35

         the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested
         date of such Swingline Loan.

                  (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
         Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on
         any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire
         participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the
         Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate
         amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate.
         Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will
         give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice
         such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline
         Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally
         agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the
         Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such
         Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline
         Loans. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
         obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to
         this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
         by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and
         continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the
         Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any
         offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving
         Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire
         transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided
         in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
         2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the
         Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to
         the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving
         Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any
         participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this
         paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan
         shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline
         Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower
         (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline
         Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of
         participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative
         Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be
         promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders
         that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to
         the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of
         participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not
         relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

                  SECTION 2.05.     Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to
         the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the
         issuance of Letters of Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably
         acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any
         time and from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period and
         prior to the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving
         Maturity Date. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and
         conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form
         of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
         Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank
         relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
         Agreement shall control.

                  (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
         Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the
         amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit),
         the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
         communication, if arrangements for doing so have been

<PAGE>

                                                                              36

         approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the
         Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of
         issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the
         issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to
         be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance,
         amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the
         date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply
         with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of
         Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other
         information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend
         such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower
         also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's
         standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A
         Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if
         (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of
         Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
         after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
         (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $50,000,000 and (ii) the total
         Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments.

                  (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or
         prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year
         after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the
         case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal
         or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the
         Revolving Maturity Date.

                  (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or
         an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and
         without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the
         Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and
         each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a
         participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's
         Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn
         under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
         foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally
         agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
         Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC
         Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the
         Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section,
         or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower
         for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation
         to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of
         Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
         affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment,
         renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and
         continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the
         Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any
         offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
         Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall
         reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an
         amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York
         City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the
         Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to
         10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has
         not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then
         not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day
         that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received
         prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii)
         the

<PAGE>

                                                                              37

         Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives
         such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the
         day of receipt, provided that the Borrower may, subject to the
         conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with
         Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR
         Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to
         the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment
         shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving
         Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment
         when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender
         of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the
         Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage
         thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving
         Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage
         of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as
         provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and
         Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations
         of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
         pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the
         Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative
         Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the
         Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank
         or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to
         this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and
         the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a
         Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing
         Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving
         Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a
         Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse
         such LC Disbursement.

                  (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to
         reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section
         shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be
         performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under
         any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack
         of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any application
         for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term
         or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under
         a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any
         respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
         respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
         against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
         with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or
         circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
         foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section,
         constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of
         setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. None of the
         Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or any of their
         Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of
         or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit
         or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective
         of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or
         any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or
         delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating
         to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a
         drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or
         any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing
         Bank, provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
         Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct
         damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of
         which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
         applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by (i) the
         Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care

<PAGE>

                                                                              38

         when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a
         Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof or (ii) the Issuing
         Bank's failure to issue a Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms
         of this Agreement when requested by the Borrower pursuant to Section
         2.05(b). The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of
         gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank
         (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
         Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such
         determination and each issuance (or failure to issue) a Letter of
         Credit. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the
         generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
         presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance
         with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole
         discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without
         responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
         information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon
         such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
         terms of such Letter of Credit.

                  (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
         following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
         represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing
         Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by
         telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and
         whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement
         thereunder, provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such
         notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse
         the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC
         Disbursement.

                  (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
         Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC
         Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the
         unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and
         including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the
         date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per
         annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans, provided that, if the
         Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to
         paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply.
         Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of
         the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of
         payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
         Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such
         Lender to the extent of such payment.

                  (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be
         replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor
         Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any
         such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement
         shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued
         for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
         2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i)
         the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of
         the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit
         to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing
         Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
         Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as
         the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank
         hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and
         shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing
         Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by
         it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue
         additional Letters of Credit.

                  (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
         occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives
         notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if
         the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with
         LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure)
         demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph,
         the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent,
         in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the
         Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date
         plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, provided that the
         obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective
         immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable,
         without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
         Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h)
         or (i) of Article VII. The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral
         pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section
         2.11(b). Each such deposit pursuant to this paragraph or Section
         2.11(b) shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the
         payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this
         Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
         control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such
         account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such
         deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole
         discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and
         expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if
         any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in
         such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse
         the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been
         reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the
         satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the
         LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
         accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC
         Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be
         applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this
         Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
         collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
         Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be
         returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of
         Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to
         provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section
         2.11(b), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be
         returned to the Borrower as and to the extent that, after giving effect
         to such return, the Borrower would remain in compliance with Section
         2.11(b) and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

                  SECTION 2.06.     Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall
         make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof
         by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., New York
         City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently
         designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders, provided
         that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The
         Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by
         promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
         account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New
         York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing
         Request, provided that ABR Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans made to
         finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section
         2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing
         Bank.

                  (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
         from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such
         Lender will not make

<PAGE>

                                                                              40

         available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
         Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has
         made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a)
         of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
         available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a
         Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing
         available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and
         the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
         forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon,
         for each day from and including the date such amount is made available
         to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
         Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of
         the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
         Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
         interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the
         interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount
         to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
         Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

                  (c) Nothing in this Section 2.06 shall be deemed to relieve
         any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments hereunder or
         to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender
         as a result of any default by any such Lender hereunder (it being
         understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the
         failure of any other Lender to fulfill its Commitments hereunder).

                  SECTION 2.07.     Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving
         Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified
         in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar
         Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
         Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such
         Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the
         case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor,
         all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different
         options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing,
         in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the
         Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans
         comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
         This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be
         converted or continued.

                  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower
         shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by
         the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03
         if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type
         resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such
         election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be
         irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
         telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
         Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by
         the Borrower.

                  (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
         shall specify the following information in compliance with Section
         2.02:

                  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
               applies and, if different options are being elected with respect
               to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be
               allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the
               information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv)
               below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

<PAGE>

                                                                              41

                  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
               Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
               Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
               Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
               such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the
               definition of the term "Interest Period".

         If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing
         but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be
         deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
         Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the
         details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting
         Borrowing.

                  (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
         Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the
         end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such
         Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest
         Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.
         Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default
         has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the
         request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so
         long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing
         may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii)
         unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
         Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

                  SECTION 2.08.     Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
         (a) Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments shall
         terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date.

                  (b) The Borrower may at any time, without premium or penalty,
         terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments,
         provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be
         in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less
         than $10,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce
         the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent
         prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the
         sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total Revolving
         Commitments.

                  (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
         election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under
         paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the
         effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such
         election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of
         any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the
         contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to
         this Section shall be irrevocable, provided that a notice of
         termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrower may
         state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other
         credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the
         Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the
         specified effective date) if such condition is not

<PAGE>

                                                                              42

         satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments
         shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall
         be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
         Revolving Commitments.

                  (d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Tranche A
         Commitments, the Tranche B Commitments, the Tranche C Commitments and
         the Tranche D Commitments have terminated.

                  SECTION 2.09.     Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a)
         The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid
         principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving
         Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
         Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan of such
         Lender as provided in Section 2.10 and (iii) to the Swingline Lender
         the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier
         of the Revolving Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline
         Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at
         least five Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made, provided
         that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower
         shall repay all Swingline Loans that were outstanding on the date such
         Borrowing was requested.

                  (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
         practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
         Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender,
         including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to
         such Lender from time to time hereunder.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which
         it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class
         and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the
         amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due
         and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the
         amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for
         the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof, which
         accounts the Administrative Agent will make available to the Borrower
         upon its reasonable request.

                  (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
         paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of
         the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein, provided
         that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain
         such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
         obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the
         terms of this Agreement.

                  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it
         be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall
         prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable
         to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such
         Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced
         by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
         (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by
         one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the
         payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note,
         to such payee and its registered assigns).

                  The foregoing amortization schedule reflects all prepayments
         of Tranche D Term Borrowings made prior to February 14, 2003.

                  (e) All Tranche R Term Loans shall be due and payable on the
         Tranche R Maturity Date.

                  (f) To the extent not previously paid, (i) all Tranche A Term
         Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche A Maturity Date, (ii) all
         Tranche B Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche B Maturity
         Date, (iii) all Tranche C Term Loans shall be due and payable on the

         and payable on the Tranche D Maturity Date.

                  (g) Any prepayment of a Term Borrowing of any Class shall be
         applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term
         Borrowing of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section ratably,
         provided that (i) any prepayment made pursuant to Sections 2.11(c)(i)
         and 2.11(c)(ii) shall be applied to reduce the scheduled repayments of
         the Term Borrowings of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section
         in reverse chronological order and (ii) the prepayments made pursuant
         to Section 2.11(c)(iv) shall be applied to reduce the scheduled
         repayments of Term Borrowings of such Class in chronological order.

                  (h) Prior to any repayment of any Term Borrowings of any Class
         hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of the
         applicable Class to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent
         by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than
         11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the
         scheduled date of such repayment. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall
         be applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing.
         Repayments of Term Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest
         on the amount repaid.

                  SECTION 2.11.     Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall
         have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any
         Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (but subject
         to Section 2.16), subject to the requirements of this Section.

                  (b) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the
         Revolving Exposures exceeds the total Revolving Commitments, the
         Borrower shall prepay Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or,
         if no such Borrowings are

         outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an account with the
         Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate
         amount equal to such excess.

                  (c) (i) Prior to the Transition Date, in the event and on each
         occasion that any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of
         Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any Prepayment
         Event, the Borrower shall, within ten Business Days after such Net
         Proceeds are received, prepay Term Borrowings (other than Tranche R
         Term Borrowings) in an aggregate amount equal to (A) 100% (or 50%, in
         the case of Net Proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests in the OnMOS
         Joint Venture) of such Net Proceeds if such Net Proceeds result from an
         event described in clause (a) of the definition of the term "Prepayment
         Event", (B) 100% of such Net Proceeds if such Net Proceeds result from
         an event (other than the issuance of Permitted Convertible Debt)
         described in clause (b) or (c) of the definition of the term
         "Prepayment Event" and (C) 75% of such Net Proceeds if such Net
         Proceeds result from the issuance of Permitted Convertible Debt or an
         event described in clause (d) of the definition of the term "Prepayment
         Event".

                  (ii) After the Transition Date, in the event and on each
         occasion that any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of
         Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any Prepayment
         Event, the Borrower shall, within ten Business Days after such Net
         Proceeds are received, prepay Term Borrowings (other than Tranche R
         Term Borrowings) in an aggregate amount equal to such Net Proceeds,
         provided that, in the case of any event described in clause (a) of the
         definition of the term "Prepayment Event" (other than the sale,
         transfer or other disposition of Receivables in connection with a
         Permitted Receivables Financing), if the Borrower shall deliver to the
         Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect
         that Holdings, the Borrower and the Subsidiaries intend to apply the
         Net Proceeds from such event (or a portion thereof specified in such
         certificate), within 180 days after receipt of such Net Proceeds, to
         acquire real property, equipment or other assets to be used in the
         business of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, and certifying that no
         Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment shall be
         required pursuant to this paragraph in respect of the Net Proceeds in
         respect of such event (or the portion of such Net Proceeds specified in
         such certificate, if applicable) except to the extent of any such Net
         Proceeds therefrom that have not been so applied by the end of such
         180-day period, at which time a prepayment shall be required in an
         amount equal to such Net Proceeds that have not been so applied.

                  (iii) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds
         are received by or on behalf of Holdings, the Borrower or any
         Subsidiary in respect of (A) the issuance of the Second Lien Notes, (B)
         any payment by the China JV of any Indebtedness owing to Holdings, the
         Borrower or any Subsidiary from the Net Proceeds to the China JV of any
         Indebtedness incurred by the China JV as contemplated by clause
         (xiv)(1) of Section 6.01(a) or (C) any Indebtedness incurred by the
         Borrower as contemplated by clause (xiv)(2) of Section 6.01(a), then,
         in each such case, the Borrower shall, on the date of receipt of such
         Net Proceeds (in the case of any such Net Proceeds in respect of the
         issuance of the Second Lien Notes or the incurrence by the Borrower of
         Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (C)) or within 10
         Business Days after such Net Proceeds are received (in the case of any
         such Net Proceeds in respect of Indebtedness of the China JV), prepay
         Term Borrowings (other than Tranche R Term Borrowings) in an aggregate
         amount equal to such Net Proceeds.

                          (iv) On the Restatement Effective Date, the Borrower
         shall prepay Term Borrowings (other than Tranche R Term Borrowings) in
         an aggregate amount equal to the Net Proceeds in respect of the
         issuance of the First Lien Notes, less $25,000,000.

                  (d) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower,
commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000, the Borrower shall
prepay Term Borrowings (other than Tranche R Term Borrowings) in an aggregate
amount equal to 75% (or, after the Transition Date, 50%) of Excess Cash Flow for
such fiscal year. Each prepayment pursuant to this paragraph shall be made on or
before the date on which financial statements are delivered pursuant to Section
5.01 with respect to the fiscal year for which Excess Cash Flow is being
calculated (and in any event within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

                  (e) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of
Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to
be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section. In the event of any optional or
mandatory prepayment of Term Borrowings made (other than Tranche R Term
Borrowings) at a time when Term Borrowings (other than Tranche R Term
Borrowings) of more than one Class remain outstanding, the Borrower shall select
Term Borrowings (other than Tranche R Term Borrowings) to be prepaid so that the
aggregate amount of such prepayment is allocated between the Tranche A Term
Borrowings, Tranche B Term Borrowings, Tranche C Term Borrowings and Tranche D
Term Borrowings pro rata based on the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Borrowings of each such Class, provided that, so long as and to the extent that
any Tranche A Term Borrowing remains outstanding, any Tranche B Lender, Tranche
C Lender or Tranche D Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) at least one Business Day prior to the
prepayment date, to decline all or any portion of any prepayment of its Tranche
B Term Loans, Tranche C Term Loans or Tranche D Term Loans, as applicable,
pursuant to this Section (other than an optional prepayment pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section, which may not be declined), in which case the
aggregate amount of the prepayment that would have been applied to prepay
Tranche B Term Loans, Tranche C Term Loans or Tranche D Term Loans, as
applicable, but was so declined shall be applied to prepay Tranche A Term
Borrowings.

                  (f) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and,
in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline
Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment.
Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the
principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the
case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount
of such prepayment, provided that, if a notice of optional prepayment of any
Loans is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the
Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of
prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance
with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a
notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Administrative Agent shall
advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as
necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment or to
prepay such Borrowing in full. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied
ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid

                                                                              48

Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent
required by Section 2.13.

                  (g) In the event of and on each occasion of any prepayment of
any Tranche B Term Borrowing or Tranche C Term Borrowing pursuant to Section
2.11(a) or (c), the Borrower shall pay to the Tranche B Lenders and Tranche C
Lenders whose Tranche B Term Loans or Tranche C Term Loans, as applicable, are
being prepaid a prepayment premium equal to (A) if such prepayment (or the date
on which such prepayment is required to be made) occurs on or prior to the date
that is one year after the Effective Date, 2.0% of the principal amount of the
Tranche B Term Loans or Tranche C Term Loans, as applicable, being prepaid or
(B) if such prepayment (or the date on which such prepayment is required to be
made) occurs more than one year after the Effective Date but on or prior to the
date that is two years after the Effective Date, 1.0% of the principal amount of
the Tranche B Term Loans or Tranche C Term Loans, as applicable, being prepaid.

                  SECTION 2.12.     Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which
shall accrue at the rate set forth in the definition of the term "Applicable
Rate" on the average daily unused amount of the Commitments of such Lender
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
date on which such Commitment terminates (it being understood that no commitment
fee shall be payable in respect of the portion of any Commitment funded on the
Effective Date). Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last
day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the dates on
which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur
after the Effective Date. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of
a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing
commitment fees, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used
to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender
(and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such
purpose).
                  (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate as interest on Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of
such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's
Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have
any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue
at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on
which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard
fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter
of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting
fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date,
provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees
payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within
10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed
on the

                                                                              49

basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                  (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due,
in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees
paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

                  SECTION 2.13.     Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR
Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate
Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

                  (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, at a rate per annum
equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate
otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of
this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

                  (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans,
upon termination of the Revolving Commitments, provided that (i) interest
accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand,
(ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a
prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving
Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid
shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the
event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current
Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the
effective date of such conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supplemental
Interest shall not be required to be paid at the time required by the preceding
sentence, except that (A) 50% of the total amount of Supplemental Interest
accrued prior to March 31, 2003 shall be payable on March 31, 2003 (to the
extent not previously paid) and (B) if the Supplemental Interest Termination
Date does not occur on March 31, 2003, then all Supplemental Interest remaining
unpaid on June 30, 2003, shall be payable in full on June 30, 2003; provided
that all unpaid Supplemental Interest shall be payable upon repayment in full of
the Loans.

                  (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base

                                                                              50

Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and
such determination shall be prima facie evidence thereof.

                  SECTION 2.14.     Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
         shall be prima facie evidence thereof) that adequate and reasonable
         means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such
         Interest Period; or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required
         Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not
         adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or
         maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest
         Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (it being understood
that the Administrative Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to give
such notice as soon as practicable after such circumstances no longer exist),
(i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing
to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be
ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing,
such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.15.     Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law
(except with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 2.17) shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
         deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
         the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such
         reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Base CD
         Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

                (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London
         interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
         Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
         participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on a Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made
by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters
of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or
the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could
have achieved but

<PAGE>

                                                                              51

for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower
will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a)
or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be prima
facie evidence thereof. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

                  (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing
Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation,
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the
Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions
incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor, and provided further that, if the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the
period of retroactive effect thereof.

                  SECTION 2.16.     Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a)
the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked
under Section 2.11(f) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the
assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender
for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to
include an amount reasonably determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of
such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have
been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the
last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a
failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the
Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such
Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be prima facie evidence thereof. The Borrower shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

                  SECTION 2.17.     Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on
account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be made free and

<PAGE>

                                                                              52

clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes,
provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased
as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative
Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor,
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent
on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be prima
facie evidence thereof.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Foreign Lender
has received written notice from the Borrower advising it of the availability of
such exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation.

                  (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender or the Issuing
Bank has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by
the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.17, which the Administrative Agent or such Lender or
the Issuing Bank is able to identify as such, it shall pay such refund to the
Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional
amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes
giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender or the Issuing Bank and without interest
(other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with
respect to such refund); provided, however, that the Borrower agrees to pay,
upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
the amount paid to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the

<PAGE>

                                                                              53

relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender or
the Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender or the
Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
Nothing contained in this Section 2.17(f) shall require the Administrative Agent
or any Lender or the Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the
Borrower or any other Person.

                  SECTION 2.18.     Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment;
Sharing of Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be
made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal,
interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under
Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required
hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such
time is expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to
the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any
such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under
any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case
of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the
period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in
dollars.

                  (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans, provided that (i) if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this

<PAGE>

                                                                              54

paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower
pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any
payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

                  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

                  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or
9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

                  SECTION 2.19.     Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of
Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in
the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the
case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

                  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative

<PAGE>

                                                                              55

Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and
Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such
Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline
Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to
it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts)
and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply. Nothing in this Section 2.19 shall be deemed to
prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result
of any default by any such Lender in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

                  Each of Holdings and the Borrower represents and warrants to
the Lenders that:

                  SECTION 3.01.     Organization; Powers. Each of Holdings, the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all
requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to
do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such
qualification is required.

                  SECTION 3.02.     Authorization; Enforceability. The
Transactions entered into and to be entered into by each Loan Party are within
such Loan Party's powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Holdings and the
Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party
is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Holdings, the Borrower or
such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.

                  SECTION 3.03.     Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The
Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or
filing with, or any other action by or before, any Governmental Authority,
except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and
except filings necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan Documents and
except where the failure to obtain such consent or approval or make such
registration or filing, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (b) will not violate any
applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational
documents of Holdings, the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or any order of
any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under
any material indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon Holdings, the
Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or any of their assets, or give rise to a
right thereunder to require any payment to be made by Holdings, the Borrower or
any of the Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the

                                                                              56

creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Holdings, the Borrower or any
of the Subsidiaries, except Liens created under the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 3.04.     Financial Condition; No Material Adverse
Change. (a) Holdings has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 1999, and consolidated statement of operations
and comprehensive income for the period from August 4, 1999, to December 31,
1999, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent public accountants.
Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position and results of operations of Holdings, the
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period
in accordance with GAAP.

                  (b) Holdings has heretofore furnished to the Lenders a pro
forma combined balance sheet and pro forma combined income statement as of and
for the pro forma fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, after giving effect to
the Acquisition Transactions. Such pro forma consolidated financial statements
(i) have been prepared in good faith based on the same assumptions used to
prepare the pro forma financial summary included in the Information Memorandum
(which assumptions are believed by Holdings and the Borrower to be reasonable),
(ii) are based on the best information available to Holdings and the Borrower
after due inquiry, (iii) accurately reflect in all material respects all
adjustments necessary to give effect to the Acquisition Transactions and (iv)
present fairly, in all material respects, the pro forma consolidated financial
position and results of operations and cash flows of Holdings, the Borrower and
the Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period, as if the Acquisition
Transactions had occurred on such date or at the beginning of such period, as
applicable.

                  (c) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the
Administrative Agent the consolidated financial statements of Cherry
Semiconductor and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal year ended February
28, 1999, reported on by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants.
Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of Cherry
Semiconductor and its subsidiaries as of such date and for such period in
accordance with GAAP.

                  (d) Except as disclosed in the financial statements referred
to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above or the notes thereto or in the
Information Memorandum and except for the Disclosed Matters, after giving effect
to the Acquisition Transactions, none of Holdings, the Borrower or the
Subsidiaries has, as of April 3, 2000, any material contingent liabilities,
unusual long-term commitments or unrealized losses.

                  (e) Since December 31, 1999, there has been no material
adverse change in the business, assets, operations, properties, financial
condition or prospects of Holdings, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

                  (f) Since February 28, 1999, there has been no material
adverse change in the business, assets, operations, properties, financial
condition or prospects of Cherry Semiconductor and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

                  SECTION 3.05.     Properties. (a) Holdings, the Borrower and
each of the Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all
its real and personal property material to its business (including its Mortgaged
Properties and Restatement Mortgaged Properties), except for minor defects in
title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as
currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes

                  (b) Holdings, the Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries owns,
or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by Holdings,
the Borrower and the Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other
Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (c) Schedule 3.05 sets forth the address of each real property

Mortgaged Property or any interest therein is subject to any right of first
refusal, option or other contractual right to purchase any such Mortgaged
Property, Restatement Mortgaged Property or interest therein.

                  SECTION 3.06.     Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a)
There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the
Borrower, threatened against or affecting Holdings, the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other
than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or
the Transactions.

                  (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect
to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, none of Holdings,
the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any
Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or
other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to
any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect
to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental
Liability.

                  (c) Since the Effective Date, there has been no change in the
status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate, has
resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  SECTION 3.07.     Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of
Holdings, the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its
property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or
its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  SECTION 3.08.     Investment and Holding Company Status. None
of Holdings, the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment
company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company

under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

                  SECTION 3.09.     Taxes. Holdings, the Borrower and each of
the Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and
reports required to have been filed and has

<PAGE>

                                                                              58

paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except (a)
any Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
for which Holdings, the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has set
aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent that the failure to do
so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.10.     ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the
assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting
such amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded
Plans by an amount that, if it were required to be fully paid, would reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any
ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction with respect to any employee
benefit plan that would reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 4069 of
ERISA.

                  SECTION 3.11.     Disclosure. Holdings and the Borrower have
disclosed to the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other
restrictions to which Holdings, the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries is
subject, and all other matters known to any of them, that, individually or in
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. The Information Memorandum and the other reports, financial statements,
certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder
(as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished), taken as a
whole, do not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, provided that (a) with
respect to projected financial information, Holdings and the Borrower represent
only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable at the time and (b) with respect to information
regarding the semiconductor market and other industry data, Holdings and the
Borrower represent only that such information was prepared by third-party
industry research firms, and although Holdings and the Borrower believe such
information is reliable, Holdings and the Borrower cannot guarantee the accuracy
and completeness of the information and have not independently verified such
information.

                  SECTION 3.12.     Subsidiaries. Holdings does not have any
subsidiaries other than the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.12 sets
forth the name of, and the ownership interest of Holdings in, each Subsidiary
and identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in each case as
of February 14, 2003.

                  SECTION 3.13.     Insurance. Schedule 3.13 sets forth a
description of all insurance maintained by or on behalf of Holdings, the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of April 3, 2000. As of the Restatement
Effective Date, all premiums in respect of such insurance that are required to
have been paid have been paid. Holdings and the Borrower believe that the
insurance maintained by or on behalf of Holdings, the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries is adequate in all material respects.

                  SECTION 3.14.     Labor Matters. As of the Restatement
Effective Date, there are no material strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against
Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of
Holdings or the Borrower, threatened. Except as could not

                                                                              59

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (a) the hours
worked by and payments made to employees of Holdings, the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any
other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters
and (b) the consummation of the Restatement Transactions will not give rise to
any right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union
under any collective bargaining agreement to which Holdings, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary is bound.

                  SECTION 3.15.     Solvency. Immediately after the consummation
of the Acquisition Transactions to occur on April 3, 2000, and immediately
following the making of each Loan made on April 3, 2000 and after giving effect
to the application of the proceeds of such Loans, (a) the fair value of the
assets of each Loan Party, at a fair valuation, will exceed its debts and
liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair
saleable value of the property of each Loan Party will be greater than the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of its debts and
other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c) each Loan Party will be able
to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) each Loan Party will
not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which
it is engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted
following April 3, 2000.

                  SECTION 3.16.     Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations
constitute "Senior Indebtedness" under and as defined in the Subordinated Debt
Documents.

                  SECTION 3.17.     Year 2000. Any reprogramming required to
permit the proper functioning, in and following the year 2000, of (a) the
computer systems of Holdings, the Borrower and the Subsidiaries and (b)
equipment containing embedded microchips (including systems and equipment
supplied by others, including Motorola and its Affiliates, or with which
Holdings's, the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's systems interface, including the
systems and equipment of Motorola and its Affiliates) and the testing of all
such systems and equipment, as so reprogrammed, has been completed. The cost to
Holdings, the Borrower and the Subsidiaries of such reprogramming and testing
and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of year 2000 to Holdings, the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries (including reprogramming errors and the failure of
others' systems or equipment) will not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.18.     Acquisition. As of April 3, 2000, the
Acquisition Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each
of the parties thereto and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
each such party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. A true,
correct and complete copy of the Acquisition Agreement has been furnished to the
Administrative Agent.

                  SECTION 3.19.     Senior Secured Obligations. All the
Obligations constitute "Credit Agreement Obligations" under and as defined in
each of the First Lien Note Indenture and the Second Lien Note Indenture. The
Liens granted pursuant to the Security Documents are prior to the Liens granted
pursuant to the Second Lien Security Documents.

                  SECTION 4.01.     [Intentionally Omitted].

                  SECTION 4.02.     Each Credit Event. The obligation of each
Lender to make a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing, and of the Issuing Bank
to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, is subject to receipt of
the request therefor in accordance herewith and to the satisfaction of the
following conditions:

                  (a) The representations and warranties of each Loan Party set
         forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material
         respects on and as of the date of such Borrowing or the date of
         issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit, as
         applicable, except to the extent such representations and warranties
         expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case such representations
         and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as to
         such earlier date).

                  (b) At the time of and immediately after giving effect to such
         Borrowing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such
         Letter of Credit, as applicable, no Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing.

Each Borrowing and each issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of
Credit shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by Holdings
and the Borrower on the date thereof as to the matters specified in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this Section. For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Borrowing"
shall not include the continuation or conversion of Loans in which the aggregate
amount of such Loans is not being increased.

                                    ARTICLE V

                              Affirmative Covenants

principal of and interest on each Loan and all fees payable hereunder shall have
been paid in full and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated and

Borrower covenants and agrees with the Lenders that:

         figures for the previous fiscal year, all reported on by
         PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or other independent public accountants of

         qualification or exception and without any qualification or exception
         as to the scope of such audit) to the effect that such consolidated
         financial statements present fairly in all material respects the
         consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Holdings,
         the Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance
         with GAAP consistently applied;

shall become delinquent or in default, except where (a) the validity or amount
thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b)
Holdings, the Borrower or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate
reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP, (c) such contest
effectively suspends collection of the contested obligation and the enforcement
of any Lien securing such obligation and (d) the failure to make payment pending
such contest could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  SECTION 5.06.     Maintenance of Properties. Each of Holdings

         in Article VI;

                  (e) any Loan Party shall fail to observe or perform any

         grace period with respect thereto;

                  (g) any event or condition occurs that results in any Material
         Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that
         enables or permits the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness
         or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf to cause any Material
         Indebtedness to become due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase,
         redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity,
         provided that this clause (g) shall not apply to secured Indebtedness

         material allegations of a petition filed against it in any such
         proceeding, (v) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors
         or (vi) take any action for the purpose of effecting any of the
         foregoing;

                  (j) Holdings, the Borrower or, subject to Section 7.02, any
         Subsidiary shall become unable, admit in writing its inability or fail
         generally to pay its debts as they become due;

                  (k) one or more judgments for the payment of money in an

         insurance as to which the insurer has admitted liability in writing)
         shall be rendered against Holdings, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any
         combination thereof and the same shall remain undischarged for a period

         by the applicable Security Document, except (i) as a result of the sale
         or other disposition of the applicable Collateral in a transaction
         permitted under the Loan Documents, (ii) any action taken by the
         Collateral Agent to release any such Lien in compliance with the
         provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or (iii) as a

Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii)

any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any
event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this
Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the
Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and
other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

                  SECTION 7.02.     Exclusion of Immaterial Subsidiaries. Solely
for the purposes of determining whether a Default has occurred under clause (h),
(i) or (j) of Section 7.01, any reference in any such clause to any "Subsidiary"
shall be deemed not to include any Subsidiary affected by any event or
circumstance referred to in any such clause that did not, as of the last day of
the fiscal quarter of the Borrower most recently ended, have assets with a value
in excess of 5.0% of the total consolidated assets of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries as of such date, provided that if it is necessary to exclude more
than one Subsidiary from clause (h), (i) or (j) of Section 7.01 pursuant to this
Section in order to avoid a Default thereunder, all excluded Subsidiaries shall
be considered to be a single consolidated Subsidiary for purposes of determining
whether the condition specified above is satisfied.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

                  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                  The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder.

                  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not
be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the
Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing
by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as
shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c)
except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to Holdings, the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by Holdings, the Borrower or a Lender, and the
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain
or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report
or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or

<PAGE>

                                                                              80

conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of
items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

                  The Administrative Agent may perform any of and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of each Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

                  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent that
shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any
such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder
or thereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  Miscellaneous

                  SECTION 9.01.     Notices. Except in the case of notices and
other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices
and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be
delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or
registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

                  (a) if to Holdings or the Borrower, to it at 5005 East

         Loan and Agency Services Group, One Chase Manhattan Plaza, 8th Floor,
         New York, New York 10081, Attention of Gloria Javier (Telecopy No.

         (813) 432-5161);

                  (d) if to the Swingline Lender, to JPMorgan Chase Bank, Loan

                  (e) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy
         number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

                  SECTION 9.02.     Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay
by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any
right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or
power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to
any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a
waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at
the time.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case
of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that
are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders,
provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender
without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of
any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce
any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or the date of any scheduled
payment of the principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.10, or the
required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the
payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of,
waive or excuse any such scheduled payment, or postpone the scheduled date of

other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of

thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without
the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case
may be), (vi) release Holdings or any Subsidiary Loan Party from its Guarantee
under the Guarantee Agreement (except as expressly provided in the Guarantee
Agreement), or limit its liability in respect of such Guarantee, without the
written consent of each Lender, (vii) except in strict accordance with the
express provisions of the Security Documents, release all or any substantial
part of the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents, without the
written consent of each Lender, (viii) change any provisions of any Loan
Document in a manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect
of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any Class differently than those
holding Loans of any other Class, without the written consent of Lenders holding
a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each
affected Class, (ix) change the definition of "Interest Period" to include
periods longer than six months or (x) change the rights of the Tranche B Lenders
or the Tranche C Lenders to decline mandatory prepayments as provided in Section
2.11, without the written consent of Tranche B Lenders or the Tranche C Lenders,
as applicable, holding a majority of the outstanding Tranche B Loans or Tranche
C Loans, as applicable, and provided further that (A) no such agreement shall
amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender,
as the case may be, and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification of this
Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of

Tranche C Lenders), the Tranche A Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders,
Tranche B Lenders and Tranche C Lenders), the Tranche B Lenders (but not the
Revolving Lenders, Tranche A Lenders and Tranche C Lenders) or the Tranche C
Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders, the Tranche A Lenders and the Tranche B
Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by Holdings, the Borrower and requisite percentage in interest of the affected
Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if
such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by
an agreement in writing entered into by Holdings, the Borrower, the Required
Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if their rights or obligations are
affected thereby, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender) if (i) by the terms
of such agreement the Commitment of each Lender

not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the
effectiveness of such amendment and (ii) at the time such amendment becomes
effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full of the
principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts
owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.03.     Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The
Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates and the Documentation Agents and their
respective Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements
of one counsel in each applicable jurisdiction for the Administrative Agent and
the Documentation Agents, in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan
Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, either

fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent,
either Documentation Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with
the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan
Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the
Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such
out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or
negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

                  (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Documentation Agents, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party
of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee")
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to
the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the
consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby,

or alleged presence, Release or threatened Release of Hazardous Materials on or

Holdings, the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any Related Person of such
Indemnitee. It is acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that, solely in
their capacities as Documentation Agents and not in their capacities as Lenders,
the Documentation Agents have no duties hereunder.

                  (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, either Documentation

Administrative Agent, such Documentation Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined
as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is
sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may
be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, such
Documentation Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as
such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based
upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term
Loans and unused Commitments at the time.

                  (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither
Holdings nor the Borrower shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim
against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or
Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

                  (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly after written demand therefor.

                  (f) Neither Motorola nor any director, officer, employee,
stockholder or member, as such, of any Loan Party or Motorola shall have any
liability for the Obligations or for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of the Obligations or their creation; provided that the foregoing shall
not be construed to relieve any Loan Party of its Obligations under any Loan
Document.
                  SECTION 9.04.     Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions
of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including
any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that
the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be
null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of
the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it), provided that
(i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate or Approved
Fund of a Lender, each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and, in the
case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Revolving Commitment or any
Lender's obligations in respect of its LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, the
Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender) must give their prior written consent to
such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) except
in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate or Approved Fund of a
Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
Commitments or Loans, the amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning
Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment
and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise

<PAGE>

                                                                              85

consent, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, except that this clause (iii) shall not be construed to prohibit
the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans, (iv) the parties to
each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire, and provided further that
any consent of the Borrower otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be
required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (g), (h), (i), (j), (n)
or (o) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and
recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement (provided that any liability of the Borrower to such
assignee under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 shall be limited to the amount, if
any, that would have been payable thereunder by the Borrower in the absence of
such assignment), and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of
the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New
York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment
of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and Holdings, the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and
any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

                  (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
(b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all
or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it),
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged,

<PAGE>

                                                                              86

(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
the performance of such obligations and (iii) Holdings, the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents,
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that
affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower
agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15,
2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

                  (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant.
A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be
entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the
participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the
benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a
Lender.

                  (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest, provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

                  SECTION 9.05.     Survival. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents
and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to
have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and
issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any
such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit
is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall
survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration
or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination
of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  SECTION 9.06.     Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto
on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all
of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with

<PAGE>

                                                                              87

respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire
contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede
any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective as provided in
the Amendment and Restatement Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.07.     Severability. Any provision of this
Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 9.08.     Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at
any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account
of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower then
existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement. The rights of
each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including any other rights of setoff) that such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.09.     GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO
SERVICE OF PROCESS. (A) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND
GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  (b) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the
extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document against Holdings, the Borrower or its
properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this
Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                  (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing
in this Agreement or any other Loan

                                                                              88

Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

                  SECTION 9.10.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                  SECTION 9.11.     Headings. Article and Section headings and
the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not
part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.12.     Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality
of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents,
including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood
that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any
assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or to any direct or
indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements or such contractual
counterparties' professional advisors, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or
(h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as
a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than Holdings or the Borrower. For the purposes of this
Section, the term "Information" means all information received from Holdings or
the Borrower relating to Holdings or the Borrower or its business, other than
any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Holdings or
the Borrower. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to
its own confidential information.

                  SECTION 9.13.     Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to
any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as
interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall
exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") that may be contracted

<PAGE>

                                                                              89

for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date
of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

                  SECTION 9.14.     Existing Credit Agreement; Effectiveness of
Amendment and Restatement. Until this Agreement becomes effective in accordance
with the terms of the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the Existing Credit
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected
hereby. After the Restatement Effective Date, all obligations of the Borrower
under the Existing Credit Agreement shall become obligations of the Borrower
hereunder, secured by the Security Documents, and the provisions of the Existing
Credit Agreement shall be superseded by the provisions hereof.

                  SECTION 9.15.     Additional Provisions for Tranche D Lenders.
No agreement effecting an amendment or modification of this Agreement or of any
other Loan Document or of any provision hereof or thereof may (i) change the
rights of the Tranche D Lenders to decline mandatory prepayments as provided in
Section 2.11, without the written consent of Tranche D Lenders holding a
majority of the outstanding Tranche D Loans or (ii) by its terms affect the
rights or duties under this Agreement of the Tranche D Lenders (but not the
Revolving Lenders, the Tranche A Lenders, the Tranche B Lenders and the Tranche
C Lenders), without an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by
Holdings, the Borrower and the requisite percentage in interest of the Tranche D
Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under Section 9.02 if the
Tranche D Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time;
provided, however, that any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an
agreement in writing entered into by Holdings, the Borrower, the Required
Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if their rights or obligations are
affected thereby, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender) if (i) such
amendment is permitted under Section 9.02, (ii) by the terms of such agreement,
the Commitment of each Tranche D Lender not consenting to the amendment provided
for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and (iii)
at the time such amendment becomes effective, each Tranche D Lender not
consenting thereto receives payment in full of the principal of and interest
accrued on each Tranche D Term Loan made by it and all other amounts owing to it
or accrued for its account under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.16.     Additional Provisions for Tranche R Lenders.
No agreement effecting an amendment or modification of this Agreement or of any
other Loan Document or of any provision hereof or thereof may by its terms
affect the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Tranche R Lenders (but

Tranche C Lenders and the Tranche D Lenders), without an agreement or agreements
in writing entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and the requisite percentage

hereunder at the time; provided, however, that any provision of this Agreement
may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by Holdings, the
Borrower, the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if their
rights or obligations are affected thereby, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline
Lender) if (i) such amendment is permitted under Section 9.02, (ii) by the terms
of such agreement, the Commitment of each Tranche R Lender not consenting to the
amendment provided for therein

shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and (iii) at the time
such amendment becomes effective, each Tranche R Lender not consenting thereto
receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each
