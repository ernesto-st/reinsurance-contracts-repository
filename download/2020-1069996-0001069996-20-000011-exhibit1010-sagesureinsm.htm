V.  Indemnification, Hold Harmless and Insurance Provisions                           A. Each party will at all times defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party                  from and against any and all claims for either damages, liabilities, personal                  injuries, death, costs or expenses including, without limitation, reasonable                  attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses, arising out of or relating to:  (a) such party&#8217;s                  intellectual property, including, without limitation, any alleged infringement of any                  copyright, patent, literary, privacy, publicity, trademark, service mark or any other                  personal, moral or contract deficiency; (b) such party&#8217;s failure to timely collect                  and pay all applicable taxes; or (c) such party&#8217;s failure or alleged failure to                  comply with this Agreement or caused in whole or in part as a result of such                  party&#8217;s negligent error or omission and/or wrongful act.  The indemnified party will                  give the indemnifying party written notice of any claim, action or demand for                  which indemnity is claimed describing in reasonable detail the nature of the                  claim.  The failure to timely provide such notice shall not affect the right of the                  indemnified parties to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the                  indemnifying party is prejudiced by such delay.  In the case of third party claims,                  the indemnifying party shall have the control of the defense and/or settlement of                  any claim, and the indemnified party shall cooperate in the defense and/or                  settlement as is required and reasonable; provided that the indemnifying party                  shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of the                  indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned                  or delayed); provided, further, that such consent shall not be required if (i) the                  settlement agreement contains from the third party asserting the claim a general                  release to all indemnified parties affected by the claim and (ii) the settlement                  agreement does not contain any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any                  business by the indemnified party or its affiliates.  If the indemnified party shall                  withhold its consent to the indemnifying party proposed settlement of such claim,                  then the indemnifying party may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay the                  indemnified party the full amount of the proposed settlement, in which case, the                  indemnifying party shall be relieved of any further liability under this Article V to                  the same extent as if such proposed settlement had been entered into on the                  terms proposed by the indemnifying party.  Each of the Parties shall cooperate,                  and cause their respective affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution                  of any legal or other proceeding that is the subject of indemnification hereunder                  and shall promptly execute such instruments and furnish or cause to be furnished                  such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery                  proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in                                                   3             </FONT></DIV>

In  addition,  confidential or                 proprietary information may, without breach hereof, be disclosed pursuant to the                 lawful  requirement  or  a  request  of  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  or                 government  agency,  provided  that  the  party  to  be  releasing  the  information,                 immediately  after  it  gains  knowledge  thereof,  gives  the  party  providing  the                 information  written  notice  (but  in  all  events  before  disclosing),  and  provided                 further that the party to be releasing the information reasonably cooperates with                 the  party  providing  the  information  (which  party  shall  reimburse  the  releasing                 party  for  their  reasonable  costs  in  such  cooperation)  in  obtaining  an  adequate                 protective  order.

The  parties  further  agree  to  use                  commercially reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential                  Information they receive, at least equivalent to the degree of care that each uses                  in its own business to protect its own similar Confidential Information.                B.

Each party will provide the other with full details of such disclosure or breach and                 will take measures to prevent a recurrence of such disclosure or breach, and will                 cooperate  with  the  party  who  has  suffered  the  unauthorized  disclosure,  at  the                 other party&#8217;s cost, in any action deemed necessary to protect the confidentiality                 of the disclosed material.            VII. Miscellaneous               A.

This clause shall not excuse the non-payment                 or late payment of any monetary obligation by either party.               B. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with                 respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporary                 agreements in connection herewith.               C. FNU and its personnel shall not be considered employees of Company. The                 relationship of the parties shall be that of independent contractors.

The relationship between FNU and Company is not one of a joint venture or                 partnership and nothing in this agreement shall be construed to create any such                 relationship between the parties hereto.               E. Any controversy, dispute, or claim between the Parties arising out of the                 interpretation, performance, or breach of this Agreement, shall be resolved by                 binding arbitration at the request of either party, in accordance with the rules of                 the American Arbitration Association. Each party will select an arbitrator.  The                 two arbitrators will select a third.  If they cannot agree on a third arbitrator within                 30 days, either may request that a selection be made by a judge of a court                 having jurisdiction. The arbitrators shall be active or retired disinterested                 executive officers of property/casualty insurance or reinsurance companies.                 Each party will (1) pay the expenses it incurs; and (2) bear the expense of the                 third arbitrator equally.  A decision agreed to by two of the arbitrators will be                 binding. The location of arbitration proceedings will be in Florida.  The decision of                 the arbitrator(s) shall be final and unreviewable for error of law or legal reasoning                 of any kind. Damages pursuant to this Agreement shall not include those                 deemed exemplary or punitive in nature, nor may they include damages for lost                 profits.  Should any dispute arise out of the terms or performance of this                 Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees                 and costs as determined by the arbitrators.  Judgment upon the arbitrators'                 award may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.               F. No waiver of any right under this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing                 and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.  No failure or delay                 in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof.               G. This Agreement is for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties and their                 successors and permitted assigns, and no third party is intended to or shall have                 any rights hereunder.
