If since the beginning of any applicable Test Period any Person that  subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into  the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test Period shall have made  any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.09, then such  financial ratio or test shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto in accordance with this  Section 1.09.

(e) If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect,  the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of the event for  which the calculation of the Consolidated Cash Interest Coverage Ratio is made had been the applicable  rate for the entire period (taking into account any hedging obligations applicable to such Indebtedness);  provided, in the case of repayment of any Indebtedness, to the extent actual interest related thereto was  included during all or any portion of the applicable Test Period, the actual interest may be used for the  applicable portion of such Test Period.  Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to  accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the  Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with  GAAP.  Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor  of a prime or similar rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually  chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrower or Restricted Subsidiary  may designate.  (f) At any time prior to June 30, 2012, any provision requiring the pro forma compliance  with Section 7.11 shall be made assuming that compliance with the Consolidated Cash Interest Coverage  Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio set forth in Section 7.11 for the Test Period ending on June 30, 2012 is  required with respect to the most recent Test Period prior to such time.  Section 1.10 Currency Generally.  For purposes of determining compliance with Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 7.03 with respect to any  amount of Indebtedness or Investment in a currency other than Dollars, no Default shall be deemed to  have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of currency exchange occurring after the time such  Indebtedness or Investment is incurred (so long as such Indebtedness or Investment, at the time incurred,  made or acquired, was permitted hereunder).  Section 1.11 Rates.  The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have  any liability with respect to, (a) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of or  any other matter related to Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term  SOFR, or any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition thereof, or any  alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including any Benchmark Replacement), including  whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate  (including any Benchmark Replacement) will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic  equivalence of, or have the same volume or liquidity as, Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate,  Adjusted Term SOFR, Term SOFR or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability,  or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.

Except as provided in Section 2.14,  each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of  $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Each Committed Loan Notice (whether  telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of  Term Loans from one Type to the other or a continuation of SOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the  Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the  principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed  or to which existing Term Loans are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period  with respect thereto and (vi) wire instructions of the account(s) to which funds are to be disbursed (it  being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the amount to be disbursed to any particular account  may be less than the minimum or multiple limitations set forth above so long as the aggregate amount to  be disbursed to all such accounts pursuant to such Borrowing meets such minimums and multiples).  If  the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or fail to give a timely notice      -77-    requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans shall be made as, or converted  to, Base Rate Loans.  Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last  day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable SOFR Loans.  If the Borrower  requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of SOFR Loans in any such Committed Loan  Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one  (1) month.  (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly  notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this  Agreement of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is  provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any  automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or continuation described in Section 2.02(a).  In the case of  each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the  Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office not later than 1:00 p.m.  on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice.  The Administrative Agent shall  make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative  Agent either by (i) crediting the account(s) of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent  with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with  instructions provided by the Borrower to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent.  (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only  on the last day of an Interest Period for such SOFR Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if  any, under Section 3.05 in connection therewith.  During the occurrence and continuation of an Event of  Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require that no Loans may be converted  to or continued as SOFR Loans.  (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the  interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate.   The determination of Adjusted Term SOFR by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the  absence of manifest error.    (e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to  the other and all continuations of Term Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than six (6)  Interest Periods in effect; provided that after the establishment of any new Class of Loans pursuant to a  Refinancing Amendment or Extension Amendment, the number of Interest Periods otherwise permitted  by this Section 2.02(e) shall increase by three (3) Interest Periods for each applicable Class so established.  (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing  shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such  Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be  made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.  (g) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the  date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such  Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of such Borrowing,  the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such Pro Rata Share or other applicable  share provided for under this Agreement available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such  Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (b) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon  </FONT></DIV>

A certificate of the Administrative Agent  submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.02(g) shall be conclusive  in the absence of manifest error.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the  Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly  remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender  pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall  constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing.

Each such  notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Class(es) and Type(s) of Loans to be  prepaid.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of its receipt of each  such notice, and of the amount of such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for  under this Agreement of such prepayment.  If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall  make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the  date specified therein.  Any prepayment of a SOFR Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest  thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.  In the case of each  prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(a), the Borrower may in its sole discretion select  the Borrowing or Borrowings (and the order of maturity of principal payments) to be repaid, and such  payment shall be paid to the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares or  other applicable share provided for under this Agreement.

(iv) Voluntary prepayments of any Class of Term Loans permitted hereunder shall be applied  to the remaining scheduled installments of principal thereof pursuant to Section 2.07 in a manner  determined at the discretion of the Borrower and specified in the notice of prepayment (and absent such  direction, in direct order of maturity); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the prepayments of Loans  occurring on the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date, the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date, the  Amendment No. 4 Effective Date or the Amendment No. 6 Effective Date shall not be deemed a  &#8220;prepayment&#8221; for purposes of this clause.

(H) Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, for purposes of  this Section 2.05(a)(v), each notice or other communication required to be delivered or otherwise  provided to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) shall be deemed to have been given upon the  Auction Agent&#8217;s (or its delegate&#8217;s) actual receipt during normal business hours of such notice or  communication; provided that any notice or communication actually received outside of normal      -85-    business hours shall be deemed to have been given as of the opening of business on the next  Business Day.

(vi) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any mandatory  prepayment of Term Loans required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of  this Section 2.05(b) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment.  Each such  notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the  aggregate amount of such prepayment to be made by the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent will  promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the contents of the Borrower&#8217;s prepayment notice and of  such Appropriate Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of the prepayment.  Each Term Lender may reject all or a  portion of its Pro Rata Share of any mandatory prepayment (such declined amounts, the &#8220;Declined  Proceeds&#8221;) of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 2.05(b)  by providing written notice (each, a &#8220;Rejection Notice&#8221;) to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower  no later than 5:00 p.m. one Business Day after the date of such Lender&#8217;s receipt of notice from the  Administrative Agent regarding such prepayment.  Each Rejection Notice from a given Lender shall  specify the principal amount of the mandatory repayment of Term Loans to be rejected by such Lender.   If a Term Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame  specified above or such Rejection Notice fails to specify the principal amount of the Term Loans to be  rejected, any such failure will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such mandatory  prepayment of Term Loans.  Any Declined Proceeds shall be retained by the Borrower.  (vii) Foreign Dispositions.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 2.05, (i) to  the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (&#8220;Foreign  Disposition&#8221;) or Excess Cash Flow attributable to Foreign Subsidiaries are prohibited or delayed by  applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds or  Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times  provided in this Section 2.05 but may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only  so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Borrower hereby  agreeing to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all actions required by the applicable  local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds or  Excess Cash Flow is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be immediately  effected and such repatriated Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow will be promptly (and in any event not  later than two Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved  against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05 and (ii) to the  extent that the Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Proceeds of  any Foreign Disposition or Foreign Subsidiary Excess Cash Flow would have material adverse tax cost  consequences with respect to such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash  Flow so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that, in the case of this  clause (ii), on or before the date on which any such Net Proceeds so retained would otherwise have been  required to be applied to reinvestments or prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) or any such  Excess Cash Flow would have been required to be applied to prepayments pursuant to this  Section 2.05(b), the Borrower may apply an amount equal to such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow to  such reinvestments or prepayments, as applicable, as if such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been  </FONT></DIV>

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the  Administrative Agent shall also be authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the  Borrower or any other Loan Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of the outstanding Loans in  accordance with the relevant provisions of this Section 2.05.

All other  computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a three hundred and sixty (360) day year  and actual days elapsed.  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and  shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid;  provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to  Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one (1) day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an  interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  Section 2.11 Evidence of Indebtedness.  (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts  or records maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one or more entries in the Register maintained by  the Administrative Agent, acting solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), as agent  for the Borrower, in each case in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by  the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the  amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments  thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the  obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the  event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and  records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the  Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender  made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through  the Administrative Agent) a Term Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender&#8217;s      -91-    Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its Term Note and  endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with  respect thereto.  (b) [Reserved].  (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to  Section 2.11(a), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.11(a), shall be prima  facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from  the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts,  such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; provided that  the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is  incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of  the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Section 2.12 Payments Generally.  (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction  for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all  payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the  respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office in  Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  The Administrative  Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share  provided for under this Agreement) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such  Lender&#8217;s applicable Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m.,  shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or  fee shall continue to accrue.  (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a  Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time  shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such extension would  cause payment of interest on or principal of SOFR Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar  month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the  date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower  or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume  that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall  not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled  thereto.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same  Day Funds, then:  (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on  demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made  available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day  from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such  Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the  applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect; and  </FONT></DIV>

When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent  (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of  any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall  constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing.  If such Lender does not pay  such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor, the Administrative  Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount  to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate  per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing.  Nothing herein  shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice  any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a  result of any default by such Lender hereunder.  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount  owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be  made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not  made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable  Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof,  the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such  Lender, without interest.  (e) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan  in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or  will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.  (f) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or  any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the  Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by  the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.03.  If the  Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in  respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the  manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may (to the fullest extent  permitted by mandatory provisions of applicable Law), but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute  such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding  Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding  Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender.  Section 2.13 Sharing of Payments.  If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain payment in respect  of any principal or interest on account of the Loans made by it any payment (whether voluntary,      -93-    involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or  other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative  Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by  them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of any  principal or interest on such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them;  provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing  Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement  entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded  and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with  an amount equal to such paying Lender&#8217;s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of  such paying Lender&#8217;s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing  Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total  amount so recovered, without further interest thereon.  For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this  paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in  accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time or (B) any payment  obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans  to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a  participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its  rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such  participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such  participation.  The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the  absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify  the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.  Each Lender that purchases a participation  pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests,  demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the  Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the  Obligations purchased.  Section 2.14 Incremental Credit Extensions.  (a) Incremental Commitments.  The Borrower may at any time or from time to time after the  Closing Date, by notice to the Administrative Agent (an &#8220;Incremental Loan Request&#8221;), request one or  more new commitments which may be in the same Facility as any outstanding Term Loans (a &#8220;Term  Loan Increase&#8221;) or a new Class of term loans (collectively with any Term Loan Increase, the  &#8220;Incremental Commitments&#8221;), whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy to  each of the Lenders.  (b) Incremental Loans.  Any Incremental Term Loans effected through the establishment of  new Term Loans made on an Incremental Facility Closing Date shall be designated a separate Class of  Incremental Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement.  On any Incremental Facility Closing Date  on which any Incremental Commitments of any Class are effected (including through any Term Loan  Increase), subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions in this Section 2.14, (i) each Incremental  Lender of such Class shall make a Loan to the Borrower (an &#8220;Incremental Term Loan&#8221;) in an amount  equal to its Incremental Commitment of such Class and (ii) each Incremental Lender of such Class shall  become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Incremental Commitment of such Class and the  Incremental Term Loans of such Class made pursuant thereto.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Incremental Term Loans may have identical terms to any of the Term Loans and be treated as the same  Class as any of such Term Loans.  </FONT></DIV>

(iii) Each Agent that is a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30)) of  the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two properly completed and  duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 with respect to fees received  on its own behalf, certifying that such Agent is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding.

(f) Any Lender or Agent claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this  Section 3.01 shall use its reasonable efforts to mitigate or reduce the additional amounts payable, which  reasonable efforts may include a change in the jurisdiction of its Lending Office (or any other measures  reasonably requested by the Borrower) if such a change or other measures would reduce any such  additional amounts (or any similar amount that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole  determination of such Lender, result in any unreimbursed cost or expense or be otherwise  disadvantageous to such Lender.  (g) If any Lender or Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund in  respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts have  been paid to it by a Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly remit such refund to such  Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnification or additional amounts paid by the Loan Party under  this Section 3.01 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of  all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, and without  interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant taxing authority with respect to such refund net of any  Taxes payable by any Agent or Lender on such interest); provided that the Loan Parties, upon the request  of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, agree promptly to return such refund (plus any penalties,  interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxing authority) to such party in the event such party is  required to repay such refund to the relevant taxing authority.  This Section shall not be construed to  require any Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to  Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other person.  Section 3.02 Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority  has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund  SOFR Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Adjusted Term SOFR, then, on notice  thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender  to make or continue SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to SOFR Loans shall be suspended until  such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to  such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall upon demand from  such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all applicable  SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans shall, if  necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause  (c) of the definition of &#8220;Base Rate&#8221;), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender  may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or promptly, if such Lender may not  lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the  Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted and all amounts due, if  any, in connection with such prepayment or conversion under Section 3.05.  Each Lender agrees to  designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not,  in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.      -103-    Section 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any Swap  Contract shall be deemed not to be a &#8220;Loan Document&#8221; for purposes of this Section 3.03):  (a) [Reserved].  (b) Replacing Future Benchmarks. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event,  the Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and  under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th)  Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without  any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan  Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection  to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. At any time that the  administrator of the then-current Benchmark has permanently or indefinitely ceased to provide such  Benchmark or such Benchmark has been announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of  such Benchmark pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative  of the underlying market and economic reality that such Benchmark is intended to measure and that  representativeness will not be restored, the Borrower may revoke any request for a borrowing of,  conversion to or continuation of Loans to be made, converted or continued that would bear interest by  reference to such Benchmark until the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent that a  Benchmark Replacement has replaced such Benchmark, and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to  have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans.  During the period referenced in the foregoing sentence, the component of Base Rate based upon the  Benchmark will not be used in any determination of Base Rate.  (c) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation  and administration of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make  Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the  contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark  Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any  other party to this Agreement.  (d) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will  promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement  and (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. Any determination,  decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group  of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 3.03, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or  adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to  take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be  made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case,  as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.03.  (e) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. At any time (including in connection with the  implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including  Term SOFR), then the Administrative Agent may remove any tenor of such Benchmark that is  unavailable or non-representative for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings and (ii)  </FONT></DIV>

Section 3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy.  (a) If any Lender reasonably determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change  in or in the interpretation of any Law, in each case after the Closing Date, or such Lender&#8217;s compliance  therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding  or maintaining any SOFR Loans, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in  connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.04(a) any such increased  costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i)(x) any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes indemnified  pursuant to Section 3.01, (y) any Taxes excluded from the definition of Indemnified Taxes (other than  Taxes excluded under clause (ii) thereof) or Other Taxes  or (z) any Taxes that are not imposed on or in  respect of its loans, loan principal, interest or other payments, letters of credit, commitments or other  obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, or (ii) the result of any  of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining the SOFR Loan (or  of maintaining its obligations to make any Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or  receivable by such Lender, then from time to time within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender  setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative  Agent given in accordance with Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional  amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.  Notwithstanding anything  herein to the contrary, for all purposes under this Agreement (including Section 3.04(b)), (x) the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives  thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives  promulgated by the Bank for International settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or  any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to  Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or  issued.  (b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or  any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the Closing Date, or compliance by  such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital  of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender&#8217;s obligations  hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender&#8217;s  desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable  detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the  Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such  additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction within fifteen (15) days after  receipt of such demand.  (c) [Reserved].  (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this  Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender&#8217;s right to demand such compensation.  (e) If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 3.04, then such Lender will, if  requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office for  any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event; provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in      -105-    the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no  material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this  Section 3.04(e) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such  Lender pursuant to Section 3.04(a), (b), (c) or (d).  Section 3.05 Funding Losses.  Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time,  which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount, the Borrower shall  promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense  actually incurred by it as a result of:  (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any SOFR Loan of the  Borrower on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or  (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to  make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any SOFR Loan of the Borrower on the date  or in the amount notified by the Borrower;  including any loss or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) arising from the liquidation or  reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the  deposits from which such funds were obtained.  Section 3.06 Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation.  (a) Any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article III shall deliver a  certificate to the Borrower setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which  shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such Agent or such  Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  (b) With respect to any Lender&#8217;s claim for compensation under Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or  3.04, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender for any amount incurred more than  one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the event  that gives rise to such claim; provided that, if the circumstance giving rise to such claim is retroactive,  then such 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect  thereof.  If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under Section 3.04, the Borrower may, by  notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to  make or continue from one Interest Period to another applicable SOFR Loan, or, if applicable, to convert  Base Rate Loans into SOFR Loan, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in  effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.06(c) shall be applicable); provided that such suspension  shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.  (c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or continue any SOFR Loan, or to convert Base  Rate Loans into SOFR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.06(b) hereof, such Lender&#8217;s  applicable SOFR Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans (or, if such conversion is  not possible, repaid) on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such SOFR Loans (or, in  the case of an immediate conversion required by Section 3.02, on such earlier date as required by Law)  </FONT></DIV>

The Administrative Agent  shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such  Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.  (e) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to  ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection  with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or  other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the  performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set  forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability,  effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other  agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported  to be created by the Collateral Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral, or  (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to  confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  Section 9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for  relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing  (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it  to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The  Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by  it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In  determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter  of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may  presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have  received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative  Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants  and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in  accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  Barclays Bank PLC as  Administrative Agent hereunder shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying  upon, any information relating to any Loan Document or the administration of any Loan Document  provided to it be Citibank, N.A. in its capacity as administrative agent hereunder prior to the Amendment  No. 4 Effective Date.   Section 9.05 Delegation of Duties.

The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its      -157-    duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory  provisions of this Article IX shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the  Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection  with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative  Agent.  Section 9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the  Borrower; provided that, with respect to the resignation of Citi as Administrative Agent on the  Amendment No. 4 Effective Date, the Lenders and the Borrower waive the requirement of such notice.   Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the  consent of the Borrower at all times other than upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an  Event of Default under Section 8.01(f) (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or  an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States; provided that the Required Lenders  hereby confirm that they have appointed Barclays as such successor Administrative Agent and that the  Borrower has consented thereto.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required  Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent  gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,  appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the  Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted  such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such  notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by  the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring  Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor  Administrative Agent is appointed) and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to  be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly,  until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above  in this Section 9.06.  Upon the acceptance of a successor&#8217;s appointment as Administrative Agent  hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges  and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be  discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not  already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section 9.06).  The fees payable by the Borrower  to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise  agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Sections 10.04 and  10.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and  their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them  while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent, and, for the avoidance of  doubt, the Borrower and Lenders confirm the provisions of this sentence foregoing shall apply to  Citibank, N.A., as retiring Administrative Agent hereunder.

Each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Hedge Bank) irrevocably authorizes  the Administrative Agent:  (a) to automatically release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the  Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon termination of the Aggregate  Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than (A) contingent indemnification  obligations and (B) obligations and liabilities under Term Loan Secured Hedge Agreements as to  which arrangements satisfactory to the applicable Hedge Bank shall have been made), (ii) at the  time the property subject to such Lien is Disposed or to be Disposed to any Person other than a  Loan Party as part of or in connection with any Disposition permitted hereunder or under any  other Loan Document, (iii) subject to Section 10.01, if the release of such Lien is approved,  authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, (iv) if the property subject to such Lien  is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guaranty  pursuant to clause (c) below or (v) that constitutes Excluded Assets;  (b) to release or subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the  Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that  is permitted by Section 7.01(u) to the extent required by the holder of, or pursuant to the terms of  any agreement governing, the obligations secured by such Liens; and  (c) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty if such Person  ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a  transaction or designation permitted hereunder; provided that no such release shall occur if such  Guarantor continues to be a guarantor in respect of any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section  7.03(r), the 2028 Notes, the 2031 Notes, any Permitted First Priority Refinancing Debt, any  Permitted Junior Priority Refinancing Debt, any Permitted Unsecured Refinancing Debt, any  Junior Financing or any Permitted Refinancing of any of the foregoing.

In each case as specified in this Section 9.10, the Administrative Agent will (and each  Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower&#8217;s expense, execute and  deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to  evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the  Collateral Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to evidence the release of such  Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan  Documents and this Section 9.10.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not  be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect  to, Obligations arising under Term Loan Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has  received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the  Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Hedge Bank.  The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any First Lien Intercreditor  Agreement, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or other intercreditor agreement or arrangement  permitted under this Agreement and any such intercreditor agreement is binding upon the Lenders.  Section 9.12 Withholding Tax Indemnity.  To the extent required by any applicable Laws, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any  payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the Internal Revenue  Service or any other authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the  Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any  Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or  not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in  circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender  shall, within 10 days after written demand therefor, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative  Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by a Loan Party  pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.04 and without limiting or expanding the obligation of the Loan  Parties to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Taxes or  otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket  expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant  Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any  Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby  authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such  Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative  Agent under this Section 9.12.  The agreements in this Section 9.12 shall survive the resignation and/or  replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender  and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

The Register shall be available for inspection by the  Borrower and any Lender (but in the case of any Lender, with respect to its own interest only), at any  reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  This Section 10.07(d) and  Section 2.11 shall be construed so that all Loans are at all times maintained in &#8220;registered form&#8221; within  the meaning of Section 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and any related Treasury regulations  (or any other relevant or successor provisions of the Code or of such Treasury regulations).  (e) Any Lender may at any time, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural  person) (each, a &#8220;Participant&#8221;) in all or a portion of such Lender&#8217;s rights and/or obligations under this  Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i)  such Lender&#8217;s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain  solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the  Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in  connection with such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or  instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall  retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any  amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents;  provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of  the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in clauses (a) through (f)  of the first proviso to Section 10.01 that requires the affirmative vote of such Lender.  Subject to  Section 10.07(f), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections  3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations of such Sections) to the same extent as if  it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.07(c).  To the extent  permitted by applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as  though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it  were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non- fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each  Participant and the principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of each participant&#8217;s interest in the  Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;).  The entries in the  Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person  whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of  this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  The portion of any Participant Register  relating to any Participant or SPC requesting payment from the Borrower or seeking to exercise its rights  under Section 10.09 shall only be available for inspection by the Borrower upon reasonable request to the  extent that such disclosure is necessary in connection with a Tax audit to establish that such commitment,  loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United  States Treasury Regulations.  (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01,  3.04 or 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the  participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to a greater payment results  from a change in any Law after the sale of the participation takes place.  (g) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at  any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement  (including under its Term Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or  assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank; provided that no such      -175-    pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any  such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a &#8220;Granting  Lender&#8221;) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time  by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an &#8220;SPC&#8221;) the option to provide  all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to  this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any  Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such  Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii)  such SPC and the applicable Loan or any applicable part thereof, shall be appropriately reflected in the  Participant Register.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) an SPC shall be entitled to the benefit of  Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and the limitations of such sections), but neither  the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or  otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement except to the extent  that the increase or change results from a change in any Law after the grant to such SPC takes place, (ii)  no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a  Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any  amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of  record hereunder.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the  Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without  prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the payment of a processing fee of  $3,500, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting  Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of  Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or  liquidity enhancement to such SPC.  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, without the consent of the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (1) any Lender may in accordance with applicable Law create a  security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Term Note, if any, held by it and (2)  any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and  the Term Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by  such Fund as security for such obligations or securities; provided that unless and until such trustee  actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 10.07, (i) no such  pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii)  such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even  though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through  foreclosure or otherwise.  (j) [Reserved].  (k) [Reserved].  (l) Any Lender may, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations with respect to Term Loans  under this Agreement to Holdings or the Borrower through (x) Dutch auctions open to all Lenders on a  pro rata basis in accordance with procedures of the type described in Section 2.05(a)(v) or (y)  </FONT></DIV>

Section 10.09 Setoff.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the occurrence and  during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender and its Affiliates (and the Administrative  Agent, in respect of any unpaid fees, costs and expenses payable hereunder) is authorized at any time and  from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being waived by the Borrower  (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party and each of its Subsidiaries) to the fullest extent  permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final) at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender and  its Affiliates or the Administrative Agent to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties  and their Subsidiaries against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender and its Affiliates or the  Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing,  irrespective of whether or not such Agent or such Lender or Affiliate shall have made demand under this  Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured  or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness.  Each Lender  agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set off and  application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity  of such setoff and application.  The rights of the Administrative Agent and each Lender under this  Section 10.09 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that the  Administrative Agent and such Lender may have at Law.  Section 10.10 Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or  agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest  permitted by applicable Law (the &#8220;Maximum Rate&#8221;).  If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest  in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the  Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.  In determining whether the  interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such  Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal  as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects  thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of  interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this  Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control;  provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or the Lenders in  any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement.  Each Loan Document was  drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against  nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.  Section 10.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All representations and warranties  made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto  or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.  Such  representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each  Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their  behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or  knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect  as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of  Credit shall remain outstanding.  Section 10.14 Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or  unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement  and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor  in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions  the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable  provisions; provided, that, the Lenders shall charge no fee in connection with any such amendment.  The  invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such  provision in any other jurisdiction.      -179-    Section 10.15 GOVERNING LAW.

The Guarantors hereby  jointly and severally agree that if the Borrower or other Guarantor(s) shall fail to pay in full when due  (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the  Guarantors will promptly pay the same in cash, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the  case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will  be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in  accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.  Section 11.02 Obligations Unconditional.  The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 11.01 shall constitute a guaranty of payment and  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, are absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, joint and      -183-    several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed  Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, the Term Notes, if any, or any other agreement or  instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of  or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever  that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or Guarantor (except  for payment in full).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of  any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder which  shall remain absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances as described above:  (i) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Guarantors, to the extent  permitted by Law, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed  Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;  (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Term  Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be done or  omitted;  (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of  the Guaranteed Obligations shall be amended in any respect, or any right under the Loan  Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be amended or  waived in any respect or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or except as  permitted pursuant to Section 11.09, any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole  or in part or otherwise dealt with;  (iv) any Lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, any Secured Party or  Agent as security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected; or  (v) the release of any other Guarantor pursuant to Section 11.09.

This Guarantee shall remain in full  force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantors and  the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Secured Parties, and their  respective successors and assigns, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this  Agreement there may be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding.  Section 11.03 Reinstatement.  The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article XI shall be automatically reinstated if and to  the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or other Loan Party in respect  of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the  Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or  otherwise.  Section 11.04 Subrogation; Subordination.  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that until the payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all  Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of the Lenders under this  Agreement it shall waive any claim and shall not exercise any right or remedy, direct or indirect, arising  by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 11.01, whether by subrogation or  otherwise, against the Borrower or any other Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any  security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations.  Any Indebtedness of any Loan Party to any Person that is  not a Loan Party permitted pursuant to Section 7.03(b)(ii) or 7.03(d) shall be subordinated to such Loan  Party&#8217;s Obligations in the manner set forth in the Intercompany Note evidencing such Indebtedness.  Section 11.05 Remedies.  The Guarantors jointly and severally agree that, as between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the  obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the Term Notes, if any, may be declared to be  forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 8.02 (and shall be deemed to have become  automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Section 8.02) for purposes of  Section 11.01, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or  such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Borrower and that, in the  event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and  payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due  and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 11.01.  Section 11.06 Instrument for the Payment of Money.  Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article XI constitutes an  instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Secured Party or Agent, at its sole  option, in the event of a dispute by such Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall  have the right to bring a motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213.  Section 11.07 Continuing Guarantee.  The guarantee in this Article XI is a continuing guarantee of payment, and shall apply to all  Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising.      -185-    Section 11.08 General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations.  In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate, limited partnership or limited liability  company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other  Law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under  Section 11.01 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or  subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under  Section 11.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability  shall, without any further action by such Subsidiary Guarantor, any Loan Party or any other person, be  automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount (after giving effect to the right of contribution  established in Section 11.10) that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other  creditors as determined in such action or proceeding.  Section 11.09 Release of Guarantors.  If, in compliance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents, (i) all or substantially all  of the Equity Interests or property of any Subsidiary Guarantor are sold or otherwise transferred to a  Person or Persons none of which is a Loan Party or (ii) any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes an Excluded  Subsidiary (any such Subsidiary Guarantor, and any Subsidiary Guarantor referred to in clause (i), a  &#8220;Transferred Guarantor&#8221;), such Transferred Guarantor shall, upon the consummation of such sale or  transfer or other transaction, be automatically released from its obligations under this Agreement  (including under Section 10.05 hereof) and its obligations to pledge and grant any Collateral owned by it  pursuant to any Collateral Document and, in the case of a sale of all or substantially all of the Equity  Interests of the Transferred Guarantor, the pledge of such Equity Interests to the Administrative Agent  pursuant to the Collateral Documents shall be automatically released, and, so long as the Borrower shall  have provided the Agents such certifications or documents as any Agent shall reasonably request, the  Administrative Agent shall take such actions as are necessary to effect each release described in this  Section 11.09 in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Collateral Documents; provided, that no  Guarantor shall be released as provided in this paragraph if (i) such Guarantor continues to be a guarantor  in respect of any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 7.03(r), the 2028 Notes, the 2031 Notes, any  Permitted First Priority Refinancing Debt, any Permitted Junior Priority Refinancing Debt, any Permitted  Unsecured Refinancing Debt, any Junior Financing or any Permitted Refinancing of any of the foregoing  or (2) such Guarantor becomes an Excluded Subsidiary solely under clause (a) of the definition of  &#8220;Excluded Subsidiary&#8221; unless at the time such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary that is a  wholly owned Restricted Subsidiary, the primary purpose (as reasonably determined by the Borrower) of  such transaction was not to evade the guarantee required pursuant to this Agreement.

The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under  this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the payment in full of the Obligations.

Section 11.12 Excluded Swap Obligations Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything in this Article XI to the contrary, no Guarantor shall be required to  make any payment pursuant to this Guarantee to any party, and the right of set-off provided in Section  10.09 shall not apply with respect to any Guarantor, in each case, with respect to Excluded Swap  Obligations, if any, of such Guarantor.
