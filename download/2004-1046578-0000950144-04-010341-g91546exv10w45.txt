and (ii) three Business Days, in the case of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate
Loans, prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each written notice shall be
in substantially the form of EXHIBIT D (a "NOTICE OF BORROWING") specifying (A)
the date of such proposed Borrowing, (B) the aggregate amount of such proposed
Borrowing, (C) whether any portion of the proposed Borrowing will be of Base
Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, (D) the initial Interest Period or Periods
for any such Eurodollar Rate Loans, and (E) the Available Credit (after giving
effect to the proposed Borrowing). The Revolving Loans shall be made as Base
Rate Loans unless, subject to Section 2.13, the Notice of Borrowing specifies
that all or a portion thereof shall be Eurodollar Rate Loans. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.3(a), if any Notice of Borrowing
requests a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent may, in its
sole discretion, make a Swing Loan available to the Borrower in an aggregate
amount not to exceed such proposed Borrowing, and the aggregate amount of the
corresponding proposed Borrowing shall be reduced accordingly by the principal
amount of such Swing Loan. Each Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in
an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof and each Borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall be in
an aggregate amount of not less than $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof, or the remaining Available Credit, if less.

                  (b) The Administrative Agent shall give to each Lender prompt
notice of the Administrative Agent's receipt of a Notice of Borrowing and, if
Eurodollar Rate Loans are properly requested in such Notice of Borrowing, the
applicable interest rate determined pursuant to Section 2.13(a). Each Lender
shall, before 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed
Borrowing, make available to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to
in Section 10.8, in immediately available funds, such Lender's Ratable Portion


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

of such proposed Borrowing. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such
funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.1
and Section 3.2, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the
Borrower.

                  (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the date of any proposed Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Ratable Portion of
such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such Ratable Portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such
Borrowing in accordance with this Section 2.2 and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so
made such Ratable Portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and
the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate for the
first Business Day and thereafter at the interest rate applicable at the time to
the Loans comprising such Borrowing. If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such corresponding amount so
repaid shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement. If the Borrower shall repay to the Administrative
Agent such corresponding amount, such payment shall not relieve such Lender of
any obligation it may have hereunder to the Borrower.

                  (d) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan or any payment
required by it on the date specified (a "NON-FUNDING LENDER"), including any
payment in respect of its participation in Swing Loans and Letter of Credit
Obligations, shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations to make such
Loan or payment on such date but no such other Lender shall be responsible for
the failure of any Non-Funding Lender to make a Loan or payment required under
this Agreement.

                  SECTION 2.3 SWING LOANS.

                  (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions contained in
this Agreement, the Swing Loan Lender may in its sole discretion make loans
(each a "SWING LOAN") otherwise available to the Borrower under the Facility
from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the date hereof
until the Revolving Credit Termination Date in an aggregate amount at any time
outstanding (together with the aggregate principal amount of any other loans
made by the Swing Loan Lender hereunder in its capacity as a Lender or the Swing
Loan Lender) at any time not to exceed the lesser of $20,000,000 and the Swing
Loan Lender's Ratable Portion of the Available Credit at such time; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Swing Loan Lender shall not make any Swing Loan to the extent
that, after giving effect to such Swing Loan, the aggregate Revolving Credit
Outstandings would exceed the Maximum Credit. The Swing Loan Lender shall be
entitled to rely on the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate delivered to the
Administrative Agent. Each Swing Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan and must be
repaid in full within seven days of its making or, if sooner, upon any Borrowing
hereunder and shall in any event mature no later than the Revolving Credit
Termination Date. Within the limits set forth in the first sentence of this
Section 2.3(a) amounts of Swing Loans repaid may be reborrowed under this
Section 2.3(a).

                  (b) In order to request a Swing Loan, the Borrower shall
telecopy to the Administrative Agent a duly completed request setting forth the
date, the requested amount and date of the Swing Loan (a "SWING LOAN REQUEST"),
to be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York
City time) on the day of the proposed borrowing. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Swing Loan Lender of the details of the requested Swing


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

Loan. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Swing Loan Lender shall make a
Swing Loan available to the Administrative Agent which will make such amounts
available to the Borrower on the date of the relevant Swing Loan Request. The
Swing Loan Lender shall not make any Swing Loan in the period commencing on the
first Business Day after it receives written notice from any Lender or the
Administrative Agent (if a Person other than the Swing Loan Lender) that one or
more of the conditions precedent contained in Section 3.2 shall not on such date
be satisfied, and ending when such conditions are satisfied or waived. The Swing
Loan Lender shall not otherwise be required to determine that, or take notice
whether, the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2 hereof have been
satisfied in connection with the making of any Swing Loan.

                  (c) The Swing Loan Lender shall notify the Administrative
Agent in writing (which may be by telecopy) weekly, by no later than 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) on the first Business Day of each week, of the aggregate
principal amount of its Swing Loans then outstanding.

                  (d) The Swing Loan Lender may demand at any time during the
continuance of an Event of Default that each Lender pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the Swing Loan Lender, in the manner provided in
SUBSECTION (E) below, such Lender's Ratable Portion of all or a portion of the
outstanding Swing Loans, which demand shall be made through the Administrative
Agent, shall be in writing and shall specify the outstanding principal amount of
Swing Loans demanded to be paid.

                  (e) The Administrative Agent shall forward each notice
referred to in CLAUSE (C) above and each demand referred to in CLAUSE (D) above
to each Lender on the day such notice or such demand is received by the
Administrative Agent (except that any such notice or demand received by the
Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on any Business Day or
any such demand received on a day that is not a Business Day shall not be
required to be forwarded to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent until the
next succeeding Business Day), together with a statement prepared by the
Administrative Agent specifying the amount of each Lender's Ratable Portion of
the aggregate principal amount of the Swing Loans stated to be outstanding in
such notice or demanded to be paid pursuant to such demand, and, notwithstanding
whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2 shall have been
satisfied (which conditions precedent the Lenders hereby irrevocably waive)
provided that the Swing Loan Lender has not received the notice referred to in
the penultimate sentence of CLAUSE (B) above prior to any such Swing Loan (and
the condition referred to in such notice has not been waived in accordance with
this Agreement), each Lender shall, before 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on
the Business Day next succeeding the date of such Lender's receipt of such
written demand, make available to the Administrative Agent, in immediately
available funds, for the account of the Swing Loan Lender, the amount specified
in such demand. Upon such payment by a Lender, such Lender shall, except as
provided in CLAUSE (F) below, be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan to the
Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall use such funds to repay the Swing Loans
to the Swing Loan Lender. To the extent that any Lender fails to make such
payment available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Loan
Lender, the Borrower shall repay such Swing Loan on demand.

                  (f) Upon the occurrence of a Default under Section 8.1(f),
each Lender shall acquire, without recourse or warranty, an undivided
participation in each Swing Loan otherwise required to be repaid by such Lender
pursuant to CLAUSE (E) above, which participation shall be in a principal amount
equal to such Lender's Ratable Portion of such Swing Loan, by paying to the
Swing Loan Lender on the date on which such Lender would otherwise have been
required to make a payment in respect of such Swing Loan pursuant to CLAUSE (E)
above, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable
Portion of such Swing Loan. If all or part of such amount is not in fact made
available by such Lender to the Swing Loan Lender on such date, the Swing Loan
Lender shall be entitled to recover any such unpaid amount on demand from such


                                      -25-
<PAGE>

Lender together with interest accrued from such date at the Federal Funds Rate
for the first Business Day after such payment was due and thereafter at the rate
of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans.

                  (g) From and after the date on which any Lender is deemed to
have made a Revolving Loan pursuant to CLAUSE (E) above with respect to any
Swing Loan or purchases an undivided participation interest in a Swing Loan
pursuant to CLAUSE (F) above, the Swing Loan Lender shall promptly distribute to
such Lender such Lender's Ratable Portion of all payments of principal of and
interest received by the Swing Loan Lender on account of such Swing Loan other
than those received from a Lender pursuant to CLAUSE (E) or (F) above.

                  SECTION 2.4 LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a) Each Existing Letter of Credit is deemed to be a letter of
credit issued hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. On the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this
Agreement, each Issuer agrees to Issue one or more Letters of Credit at the
request of the Borrower for the account of the Borrower from time to time on any
Business Day during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on
the earlier of the Revolving Credit Termination Date and 30 days prior to the
Scheduled Termination Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Issuer shall be under any
obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit if:

                  (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
         Authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or
         restrain such Issuer from Issuing such Letter of Credit or any
         Requirement of Law applicable to such Issuer or any request or
         directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
         Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuer shall
         prohibit, or request that such Issuer refrain from, the Issuance of
         letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or
         shall impose upon such Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any
         restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuer is
         not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the date of this Agreement
         or result in any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense (for which such
         Issuer is not otherwise compensated) that was not applicable, in effect
         or known to such Issuer as of the date of this Agreement and that such
         Issuer in good faith deems material to it;

                  (ii) such Issuer shall have received written notice from the
         Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower, on or prior to the
         requested date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit, that one or more
         of the applicable conditions contained in Section 3.2 and Section 2.4
         is not then satisfied;

                  (iii) after giving effect to the Issuance of such Letter of
         Credit, the aggregate Revolving Credit Outstandings would exceed the
         Maximum Credit at such time;

                  (iv) after giving effect to the Issuance of such Letter of
         Credit, the Letter of Credit Obligations at such time exceed 50% of the
         aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments;

                  (v) any fees due in connection with a requested Issuance have
         not been paid; or

                  (vi) such Letter of Credit is requested to be Issued in a form
         that is not acceptable to such Issuer.

None of the Lenders (other than the Issuers in their capacity as such) shall
have any obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit.



                                      -26-
<PAGE>

                  (b) In no event shall the expiration date of any Letter of
Credit, (i) be more than one year after the date of Issuance thereof, or (ii),
except as provided below, be less than thirty days prior to the Scheduled
Termination Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Letter of Credit with a one-year
term may provide for the renewal thereof, prior to the Scheduled Termination
Date, for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the
expiry date referred to in clause (ii) above).

                  (c) In connection with the Issuance of each Letter of Credit,
the Borrower shall give the relevant Issuer and the Administrative Agent at
least two Business Days' prior written notice, in such written or electronic
form as is acceptable to the Issuer, of the requested Issuance of such Letter of
Credit (a "LETTER OF CREDIT Request"). Such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall specify the Issuer of such Letter of Credit, the stated amount of the
Letter of Credit requested, which stated amount shall not be less than $10,000,
the date of Issuance of such requested Letter of Credit (which day shall be a
Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which date
shall be a Business Day), and the Person for whose benefit the requested Letter
of Credit is to be Issued. Such notice, to be effective, must be received by the
relevant Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on the second Business Day prior to the requested Issuance of such
Letter of Credit.

                  (d) Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
this Section 2.4, the relevant Issuer shall, on the requested date, Issue a
Letter of Credit on behalf of the Borrower and, if applicable, one of its
Subsidiaries in accordance with such Issuer's usual and customary business
practices. No Issuer shall Issue any Letter of Credit in the period commencing
on the first Business Day after it receives written notice from any Lender or
the Administrative Agent that one or more of the conditions precedent contained
in Section 3.2 shall not on such date be satisfied, and ending when such
conditions are satisfied. The relevant Issuer shall not otherwise be required to
determine that, or take notice whether, the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 3.2 have been satisfied in connection with the Issuance of any Letter of
Credit.

                  (e) Each Issuer shall comply with the following:

                  (i) give the Administrative Agent written notice (or
         telephonic notice confirmed promptly thereafter in writing, which
         writing may be by telecopier) of the Issuance of a Letter of Credit
         Issued by it, of all drawings under a Letter of Credit Issued by it,
         the payment (or the failure to pay when due) by the Borrower of any
         Reimbursement Obligation when due (which notice the Administrative
         Agent shall promptly transmit by telecopy or similar transmission to
         each Lender);

                  (ii) upon the request of any Lender, furnish to such Lender
         copies of such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by
         such Lender; and

                  (iii) no later than 10 Business Days following the last day of
         each calendar month, provide to the Administrative Agent (and the
         Administrative Agent shall provide a copy to each Lender requesting the
         same) and the Borrower, a schedule in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, setting forth the aggregate
         Letter of Credit Obligations outstanding at the end of each month and
         any information requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
         relating thereto.

                  (f) Immediately upon the Issuance by an Issuer of a Letter of
Credit in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Lender, and each
Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and
received from such Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest
and participation, to the extent of such Lender's Ratable Portion, in such


                                      -27-
<PAGE>

Letter of Credit and the obligations of the Borrower with respect thereto
(including all Letter of Credit Obligations with respect thereto) and any
security therefor and guaranty pertaining thereto.

                  (g) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuer of any Letter of
Credit the amount of all Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Issuer under
any Letter of Credit Issued for its account no later than the date that is the
next succeeding Business Day after the Borrower receives written notice from
such Issuer that payment has been made under such Letter of Credit (the
"REIMBURSEMENT DATE"), irrespective of any claim, set-off, defense or other
right that the Borrower may have at any time against such Issuer or any other
Person. In the event that any Issuer makes any payment under any Letter of
Credit and the Borrower shall not have repaid such amount to such Issuer
pursuant to this CLAUSE (G) on or before 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the
next Business Day following the Borrower's receipt of the aforesaid notice, then
(i) the relevant Issuer shall notify the Administrative Agent of such failure to
repay, (ii) such Reimbursement Obligation shall be payable on demand with
interest thereon computed from the date on which such Reimbursement Obligation
arose to the date of repayment in full at the rate of interest applicable to
past due Revolving Loans bearing interest at a rate based on the Base Rate
during such period, (iii) the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected (if a
formal notice of Borrowing has not been received by the Administrative Agent in
respect of such Reimbursement Obligation) to have the Reimbursement Obligation
satisfied by the Borrowing of a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such
Reimbursement Obligation and (iv) each Lender shall, except during the
continuance of a Default or Event of Default under Section 8.1(f) and
notwithstanding whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2
shall have been satisfied (which conditions precedent the Lenders hereby
irrevocably waive) provided that such Issuer has not received the notice
referred to in the penultimate sentence of CLAUSE (D) above (and the condition
referred to in such notice has not been waived in accordance with this
Agreement), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuer the
amount of such Lender's Ratable Portion of such Reimbursement Obligations and be
deemed to have made a Revolving Loan to the Borrower in the principal amount of
such payment. Prior to the funding of such Revolving Loan, if the Administrative
Agent so notifies such Lender prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on any
Business Day, such Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Issuer its Ratable Portion of the amount of such payment on
such Business Day in immediately available funds. Whenever any Issuer receives
from the Borrower a payment of a Reimbursement Obligation as to which the
Administrative Agent has received for the account of such Issuer any payment
from a Lender pursuant to this CLAUSE (G), such Issuer shall pay to the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each
Lender, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable
Portion of the amount of such payment adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the
respective amounts the Lenders have paid in respect of such Reimbursement
Obligation.

                  (h) The Borrower's obligation to pay each Reimbursement
Obligation and the obligations of the Lenders to make payments to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuers with respect to Letters of
Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under any and all
circumstances whatsoever, including the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default, and irrespective of:

                  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
         Credit or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein;

                  (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure
         from all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or any Loan
         Document;

                  (iii) the existence of any claim, set off, defense or other
         right that the Borrower, any other party guaranteeing, or otherwise
         obligated with, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

         or any other Person may at any time have against the beneficiary under
         any Letter of Credit, any Issuer, the Administrative Agent or any
         Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement,
         any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or
         transaction;

                  (iv) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
         Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
         respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
         respect;

                  (v) payment by the Issuer under a Letter of Credit against
         presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the
         terms of such Letter of Credit; and

                  (vi) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind of
         any Issuer, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any other Person
         or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar
         to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
         Section 2.4, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the
         Borrower's obligations hereunder.

Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the relevant Issuer under or in
connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not put such Issuer under any
resulting liability to the Borrower or any Lender. In determining whether drafts
and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms
thereof, the Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in
order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any
Letter of Credit, the Issuer may rely exclusively on the documents presented to
it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein,
including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of
Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the
amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such
Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on
its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any
other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged
or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any
respect whatsoever and any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the
documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in
each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of
the Issuer.

                  (i) If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made
its Ratable Portion of the amount of the payment required by CLAUSE (G) above
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuer, such
Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuer
forthwith on demand any such unpaid amount together with interest thereon, for
the first Business Day after payment was first due at the Federal Funds Rate,
and thereafter until such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Issuer, at the rate PER ANNUM applicable to Base Rate Loans
under the Facility. The failure of any Lender to make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuer its Ratable Portion of any
such payment shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to
make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuer its
Ratable Portion of any payment on the date such payment is to be made, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuer such other
Lender's Ratable Portion of any such payment.

                  (j) From time to time, the Borrower may by notice to the
Administrative Agent designate an additional Lender (in addition to CNAI) that
agrees (in its sole discretion) to act in such capacity is reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as an Issuer. Each such additional
Issuer shall execute a counterpart of this Agreement upon the approval of the
Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and
shall thereafter be an Issuer hereunder for all purposes.

                  SECTION 2.5 REDUCTION AND TERMINATION OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT
COMMITMENTS.

                  The Borrower may, upon same Business Day's notice to the
Administrative Agent, terminate in whole or reduce in part ratably the unused
portions of the respective Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x) each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate
amount of not less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof and (y) no such termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit
Commitments shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any
repayments of the Revolving Loans made on the effective date thereof, the
aggregate Revolving Credit Outstandings would exceed the Total Revolving Credit
Commitments.

                  SECTION 2.6 REPAYMENT OF LOANS.

                  The Borrower promises to repay the entire unpaid principal
amount of the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans and any Reimbursement Obligations
(unless required to be paid sooner hereunder), and cash collateralize all
outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with Section 8.3, on the Revolving
Credit Termination Date.

                  SECTION 2.7 EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

                  (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing Indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to time, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to
time under this Agreement.

                  (b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in
accordance with its usual practice in which it shall record (i) the amount of
each Loan made and, if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable by the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower, whether such sum
constitutes principal or interest, fees, expenses or other amounts due under the
Loan Documents and each Lender's Ratable Portion thereof, if applicable.

                  (c) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
CLAUSES (A) and (B) of this Section 2.7 shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations recorded therein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of any Lender
or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall
not in any manner affect the obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loans in
accordance with their terms.

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, in
the event that any Lender requests that the Borrower execute and deliver a
promissory note or notes payable to such Lender in order to evidence the
Indebtedness owing to such Lender by the Borrower hereunder, the Borrower will
promptly execute and deliver a Revolving Credit Note or Revolving Credit Notes
to such Lender evidencing any Revolving Loans of such Lender, substantially in
the form of EXHIBIT C.

                  SECTION 2.8 PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a) The Borrower may, upon at least three Business Days' prior
notice to the Administrative Agent, stating the proposed date and aggregate
principal amount of the prepayment, prepay the outstanding principal amount of
the Revolving Loans in whole or in part; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) if any
prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan is made by the Borrower other than on the
last day of an Interest Period for such Loan, the Borrower shall also pay any
amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.13(e), (ii) each partial prepayment of
Eurodollar Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than
$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the
remaining balance of the Loans, if less) and each partial prepayment of Base


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

Rate Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than $1,000,000 or
an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the remaining balance
of the Loans, if less) and (iii) the Borrower may prepay the outstanding
principal amount of any Swing Loan in whole or in part, with no minimum partial
prepayment requirement. Upon the giving of such notice of prepayment, the
principal amount of Revolving Loans specified to be prepaid shall become due and
payable on the date specified for such prepayment.

                  (b) The Borrower shall prepay Loans, or cash collateralize
outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with Section 8.3, to the extent as a
result of Section 2.17 or any Scheduled Termination Date, and after giving
effect thereto, the aggregate Revolving Credit Outstandings would exceed the
then Lenders' total Revolving Credit Commitment, and otherwise shall have no
right to prepay the principal amount of any Loan other than as provided in this
Section 2.8.

                  SECTION 2.9 INTEREST.

                  (a) RATE OF INTEREST.

                  All Loans and the outstanding amount of all other Obligations
shall bear interest, in the case of Loans, on the unpaid principal amount
thereof from the date such Loans are made and, in the case of such other
Obligations, from the date such other Obligations are due and payable until, in
all cases, paid in full, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.9(c), as
follows:

                  (i) if a Base Rate Loan or such other Obligation, at a rate
         PER ANNUM equal to the sum of (A) the Base Rate as in effect from time
         to time, PLUS (B) the Applicable Margin; and

                  (ii) if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, at a rate PER ANNUM equal to
         the sum of (A) the Eurodollar Rate determined for the applicable
         Interest Period, PLUS (B) the Applicable Margin in effect from time to
         time during such Interest Period.

                  (b) INTEREST PAYMENTS.

                  (i) Interest accrued on each Base Rate Loan (other than Swing
         Loans) shall be payable in arrears (A) on the last day of each calendar
         quarter, commencing on the first such day following the making of such
         Base Rate Loan and (B) if not previously paid in full, at maturity
         (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Base Rate Loan; (ii)
         interest accrued on Swing Loans shall be payable in arrears on the last
         day of each calendar quarter; (iii) interest accrued on each Eurodollar
         Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears (A) on the last day of each
         Interest Period applicable to such Loan and if such Interest Period has
         a duration of more than three months, on each day during such Interest
         Period occurring every three months from the first day of such Interest
         Period, (B) upon the payment or prepayment thereof in full or in part
         and (C) if not previously paid in full, at maturity (whether by
         acceleration or otherwise) of such Eurodollar Rate Loan; and (iv)
         interest accrued on the amount of all other Obligations shall be
         payable on demand from and after the time such Obligation becomes due
         and payable (whether by acceleration or otherwise).

                  (c) DEFAULT INTEREST.

                  Notwithstanding the rates of interest specified in Section
2.9(a) or elsewhere herein, effective immediately upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, and for as long thereafter as such Event of Default shall be
continuing, the principal balance of all Loans and the amount of all other


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

Obligations then due and payable shall bear interest at a rate that is two
percent PER ANNUM in excess of the rate of interest applicable to such
Obligations from time to time.

                  SECTION 2.10 CONVERSION/CONTINUATION OPTION.

                  (a) The Borrower may elect (i) at any time on any Business Day
to convert Base Rate Loans (other than Swing Loans) or any portion thereof to
Eurodollar Rate Loans, and (ii) at the end of any applicable Interest Period, to
convert Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof into Base Rate Loans or to
continue such Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof for an additional
Interest Period; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the aggregate amount of the Eurodollar
Loans for each Interest Period must be in the amount of $5,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each conversion or
continuation shall be allocated among the Loans of each Lender in accordance
with its Ratable Portion. Each such election shall be in substantially the form
of EXHIBIT F (a "NOTICE OF CONVERSION OR CONTINUATION") and shall be made by
giving the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days' prior written
notice specifying (A) the amount and type of Loan being converted or continued,
(B) in the case of a conversion to or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans,
the applicable Interest Period, and (C) in the case of a conversion, the date of
conversion.

                  (b) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender
of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion or Continuation and of the options
selected therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no conversion in whole or in
part of Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans, and no continuation in whole
or in part of Eurodollar Rate Loans upon the expiration of any applicable
Interest Period, shall be permitted at any time at which (i) a Default or an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or (ii) the continuation
of, or conversion into, would violate or otherwise not be permitted under any of
the provisions of Section 2.13. If, within the time period required under the
terms of this Section 2.10, the Administrative Agent does not receive a Notice
of Conversion or Continuation from the Borrower containing a permitted election
to continue any Eurodollar Rate Loans for an additional Interest Period or to
convert any such Loans, then, upon the expiration of the applicable Interest
Period, such Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans. Each
Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be irrevocable.

                  SECTION 2.11 FEES.

                  (a) APPLICABLE UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE.

                  The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender a commitment fee on
the daily average amount of the Unused Commitments from the date hereof until
the Revolving Credit Termination Date at the Applicable Unused Commitment Fee
Rate, payable in arrears (i) on the last day of each calendar quarter,
commencing on the first such day following the Effective Date and (ii) on the
Revolving Credit Termination Date.

                  (b) LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

                  The Borrower agrees to pay the following amounts with respect
to Letters of Credit issued by any Issuer:

                  (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Issuer
         of a Letter of Credit, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by
         such Issuer, an issuance fee equal to 0.10% per annum of the maximum
         amount available from time to time to be drawn under such Letter of


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

         Credit, payable in arrears (A) on the last day of each calendar
         quarter, commencing on the first such day following the issuance of
         such Letter of Credit and (B) on the Revolving Credit Termination Date;
         and

                  (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of
         the Lenders, with respect to each Letter of Credit, a fee accruing at a
         rate PER ANNUM equal to the Applicable Margin for Letters of Credit of
         the maximum amount available from time to time to be drawn under such
         Letter of Credit, payable in arrears (A) on the last day of each
         calendar quarter, commencing on the first such day following the
         issuance of such Letter of Credit and (B) on the Revolving Credit
         Termination Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that during the continuance of an
         Event of Default, such fee shall be increased by two percent PER ANNUM
         and shall be payable on demand.

                  (c) FACILITY FEES.

                  The Borrower shall pay:

                  (i) upon each Facility Extension, a fee to each Extending
         Lender in an amount equal to such percentage of such Lender's Revolving
         Credit Commitment outstanding on the Extension Date applicable to such
         Facility Extension; and

                  (ii) upon the occurrence of a Facility Increase, a fee to each
         Lender that participates in such Facility Increase (including any
         Eligible Assignee that executes an Assumption Agreement in connection
         with such Facility Increase) and each new Lender to be determined by
         the Administrative Agent based on market conditions at the time of such
         Facility Increase, which fee shall be payable in the Facility Increase
         Effective Date.

                  (d) ADDITIONAL FEES.

                  The Borrower has agreed to pay to the Administrative Agent and
the Arrangers additional fees, the amount and dates of payment of which are
embodied in any separate fee letter entered into between or among such parties.

                  SECTION 2.12 PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.

                  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder (including
fees and expenses) not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when
due, in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in
Section 10.8 in immediately available funds without deduction, set-off or
counterclaim. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be
distributed immediately available funds relating to the payment of principal or
interest or fees to the Lenders, in accordance with the application of payments
set forth in CLAUSES (E) and (F) of this Section 2.12, as applicable, for the
account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13(c), Section 2.13(e), Section 2.14 or
Section 2.15 shall be paid only to the affected Lender or Lenders and amounts
payable with respect to Swing Loans shall be paid only to the Swing Loan Lender.
Payments received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. (New York City
time) shall be deemed to be received on the next Business Day.

                  (b) All computations of interest and of fees based on the Base
Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365/366
days, as the case may be and all computations of all other interest and all fees
shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in
each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding
the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest and fees are
payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.



                                      -33-
<PAGE>

                  (c) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due
on a day other than a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall
in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as
the case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such extension would cause payment
of interest on or principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan to be made in the next
calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business
Day. All repayments of any Revolving Loans shall be applied as follows: FIRST,
to repay such Loans outstanding as Base Rate Loans and then to repay such Loans
outstanding as Eurodollar Rate Loans with those Eurodollar Rate Loans having
earlier expiring Interest Periods being repaid prior to those having later
expiring Interest Periods.

                  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower to the Lenders prior to the date on which any payment is due
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such
due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent that the Borrower shall not have made such payment in full to the
Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with
interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate, for the first Business Day, and,
thereafter, at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans, for each day from the
date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays
such amount to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(f) (and except
as otherwise provided in Section 2.8), all payments and any other amounts
received by the Administrative Agent from or for the benefit of the Borrower
shall be applied as follows: FIRST, to pay principal of and interest on any
portion of the Loans that the Administrative Agent may have advanced pursuant to
the express provisions of this Agreement on behalf of any Lender, for which the
Administrative Agent has not then been reimbursed by such Lender or the
Borrower, SECOND, to pay all other Obligations then due and payable, and THIRD,
as the Borrower so designates. Payments in respect of Swing Loans received by
the Administrative Agent shall be distributed to the Swing Loan Lender; payments
in respect of Revolving Loans received by the Administrative Agent shall be
distributed to each Lender in accordance with such Lender's Ratable Portion; and
all payments of fees and all other payments in respect of any other Obligation
shall be allocated among such of the Lenders and Issuers as are entitled
thereto, and, for such payments allocated to the Lenders, in proportion to their
respective Ratable Portions.

                  (f) During the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any
and all payments in respect of the Obligations and agrees that, notwithstanding
the provisions of CLAUSE (E) above, the Administrative Agent may, and shall upon
either (A) the written direction of the Requisite Lenders or (B) the
acceleration of the Obligations pursuant to Section 8.2, apply all payments
(subject in any event to the restrictions set forth in Section 8.3 in respect of
the application of amounts funded to a cash collateral account in respect of
outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations) in respect of any Obligations and all
funds on deposit in any cash collateral account in the following order:

                  (i) FIRST, to pay interest on and then principal of any
         portion of the Revolving Loans which the Administrative Agent may have
         advanced on behalf of any Lender for which the Administrative Agent has
         not then been reimbursed by such Lender or the Borrower;

                  (ii) SECOND, to pay interest on and then principal of any
         Swing Loan;



                                      -34-
<PAGE>

                  (iii) THIRD, to pay Obligations in respect of any expense
         reimbursements or indemnities then due the Administrative Agent;

                  (iv) FOURTH, to pay Obligations in respect of any expense
         reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Lenders and the Issuers;

                  (v) FIFTH, to pay Obligations in respect of any fees then due
         to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuers;

                  (vi) SIXTH, to pay interest then due and payable in respect of
         the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations;

                  (vii) SEVENTH, to pay or prepay principal payments on the
         Loans and Reimbursement Obligations and to provide cash collateral for
         outstanding Letter of Credit Undrawn Amounts in the manner described in
         Section 8.3, ratably to the aggregate principal amount of such Loans,
         Reimbursement Obligations and Letter of Credit Undrawn Amounts; and

                  (viii) EIGHTH, to the ratable payment of all other
         Obligations;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if sufficient funds are not available to fund all
payments to be made in respect of any Obligation described in any of clauses
first through eighth, the available funds being applied with respect to any such
Obligation (unless otherwise specified in such clause) shall be allocated to the
payment of such Obligations ratably, based on the proportion of the
Administrative Agent's and each Lender's or Issuer's interest in the aggregate
outstanding Obligations described in such clauses. The order of priority set
forth in clauses first through eighth of this CLAUSE (F) may at any time and
from time to time be changed by the agreement of all Lenders without necessity
of notice to or consent of or approval by the Borrower, or any other Person. The
order of priority set forth in clauses first through fifth of this CLAUSE (F)
may be changed only with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent
in addition to all Lenders.

                  (g) At the option of the Administrative Agent, principal on
the Swing Loans, Reimbursement Obligations, interest, fees, expenses and other
sums due and payable in respect of the Revolving Loans may be paid from the
proceeds of Swing Loans or Revolving Loans. The Borrower hereby authorizes the
Swing Loan Lender to make Swing Loans pursuant to Section 2.3(a), and the
Lenders to make Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.2(a), from time to time in
the Swing Loan Lender's, or such Lender's discretion, that are in the amounts of
any and all principal payable with respect to the Swing Loans and interest,
fees, expenses and other sums payable in respect of the Revolving Loans, and
further authorizes the Administrative Agent to give the Lenders notice of any
Borrowing with respect to such Swing Loans and Revolving Loans and to distribute
the proceeds of such Swing Loans and Revolving Loans to pay such amounts. The
Borrower agrees that all such Swing Loans and Revolving Loans so made shall be
deemed to have been requested by it (irrespective of the satisfaction of the
conditions in Section 3.2, which conditions the Lenders irrevocably waive) and
directs that all proceeds thereof shall be used to pay such amounts.

                  SECTION 2.13 SPECIAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING EURODOLLAR RATE
LOANS.

                  (a) DETERMINATION OF INTEREST RATE.

                  The Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period for Eurodollar
Rate Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the definition of "EURODOLLAR RATE." The Administrative


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

Agent's determination shall be presumed to be correct, absent manifest error,
and shall be binding on the Borrower.

                  (b) INTEREST RATE UNASCERTAINABLE, INADEQUATE OR UNFAIR.

                  In the event that: (i) the Administrative Agent determines
that adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable
interest rates by reference to which the Eurodollar Rate then being determined
is to be fixed; or (ii) the Requisite Lenders notify the Administrative Agent
that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period will not adequately reflect the
cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans for such Interest
Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the
Lenders, whereupon each Eurodollar Loan shall automatically, on the last day of
the current Interest Period for such Loan, convert into a Base Rate Loan and the
obligations of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate
Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative
Agent shall notify the Borrower that the Requisite Lenders have determined that
the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  (c) INCREASED COSTS.

                  If at any time any Lender determines that the introduction of
or any change in or in the interpretation of any law, treaty or governmental
rule, regulation or order (other than any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve requirements included in determining the Eurodollar Rate) or
the compliance by such Lender with any guideline, request or directive from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of
law), shall have the effect of increasing the cost to such Lender of agreeing to
make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans, then the
Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of
such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased
cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender,
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (d) ILLEGALITY.

                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any
Lender determines that the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order
after the date of this Agreement shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or
other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or
its Eurodollar Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or to continue to
fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof and demand
therefor by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i)
the obligation of such Lender to make or to continue Eurodollar Rate Loans and
to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and
each such Lender shall make a Base Rate Loan as part of any requested Borrowing
of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (ii) if the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans are then
outstanding, the Borrower shall immediately convert each such Loan into a Base
Rate Loan. If at any time after a Lender gives notice under this Section 2.13(d)
such Lender determines that it may lawfully make Eurodollar Rate Loans, such
Lender shall promptly give notice of that determination to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit the
notice to each other Lender. The Borrower's right to request, and such Lender's
obligation, if any, to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall thereupon be restored.

                  (e) BREAKAGE COSTS.

                  In addition to all amounts required to be paid by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.9, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon demand,
for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including any loss or expense incurred
by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired
by such Lender to fund or maintain such Lender's Eurodollar Rate Loans to the
Borrower but excluding any loss of the Applicable Margin on the relevant Loans)
which that Lender may sustain (i) if for any reason a proposed Borrowing,
conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans does not occur on a
date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion or
Continuation given by a Borrower or in a telephonic request by it for borrowing
or conversion or continuation or a successive Interest Period does not commence
after notice therefor is given pursuant to Section 2.10, (ii) if for any reason
any Eurodollar Rate Loan is prepaid (including (x) as a result of any conversion
into a Base Rate Loan on a date which is not the last day of the applicable
Interest Period, (iii) as a consequence of a required conversion of a Eurodollar
Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan as a result of any of the events indicated in
Section 2.13(d), or (iv) as a consequence of any failure by a Borrower to repay
Eurodollar Rate Loans when required by the terms hereof. The Lender making
demand for such compensation shall deliver to the Borrower concurrently with
such demand a written statement as to such losses, expenses and liabilities, and
this statement shall be conclusive as to the amount of compensation due to such
Lender, absent manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.14 CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

                  If at any time any Lender determines that (a) the adoption of
or any change in or in the interpretation of any law, treaty or governmental
rule, regulation or order after the date of this Agreement regarding capital
adequacy, (b) compliance with any such law, treaty, rule, regulation, or order,
or (c) compliance with any guideline or request or directive from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law)
shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's (or any
corporation controlling such Lender's) capital as a consequence of its
obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level
below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for
such adoption, change, compliance or interpretation, then, upon demand from time
to time by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent),
the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender for such reduction. A certificate as to
such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such
Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.15 TAXES.

                  (a) Any and all payments by any Loan Party under each Loan
Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings,
and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each
Lender and the Administrative Agent (A) taxes measured by its net income, and
franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision
thereof) under the laws of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the
case may be) is organized and (B) any United States withholding taxes payable
with respect to payments under the Loan Documents under laws (including any
statute, treaty or regulation) in effect on the Effective Date (or, in the case
of an Eligible Assignee, the date of the Assignment and Acceptance) applicable
to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, but not
excluding any United States withholding taxes payable as a result of any change
in such laws occurring after the Effective Date (or the date of such Assignment
and Acceptance) and (ii) in the case of each Lender, taxes measured by its net
income, and franchise taxes imposed on it as a result of a present or former
connection (but not any such connection arising solely from the Administrative


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or
received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document) between such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority
imposing such tax or any taxing authority thereof or therein (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). If any Taxes shall be
required by law to be deducted from or in respect of any sum payable under any
Loan Document to any Lender or the Administrative Agent (w) the sum payable
shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 2.15 such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (x) the relevant Loan Party shall make such deductions,
(y) the relevant Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
taxing authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law, and (z)
the relevant Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent evidence of
such payment.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar levies of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or
any applicable foreign jurisdiction, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document
(collectively, "OTHER TAXES").

                  (c) Except for amounts due as a result of a breach of a
Lender's obligations under Section 2.15(f), the Borrower will indemnify each
Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes
(including any Taxes and Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section 2.15 paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent
(as the case may be) and any liability (including for penalties, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes
or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This indemnification shall be
made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as
the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

                  (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes or
Other Taxes by any Loan Party, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative
Agent, at its address referred to in Section 10.8, the original or a certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

                  (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower
contained in this Section 2.15 shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations.

                  (f) On or prior to the Effective Date in the case of each
Non-U.S. Lender that is a signatory hereto, and on the date of the Assignment
and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other
Non-U.S. Lender and from time to time thereafter if requested by the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, each Non-U.S. Lender that is entitled at such time to
an exemption from United States withholding tax, or that is subject to such tax
at a reduced rate under an applicable tax treaty, shall provide the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower with two completed originals of the
following: (i) Form W-8ECI (claiming exemption from withholding because the
income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business) (or any successor
form); (ii) Form W-8BEN (claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, withholding
tax under an income tax treaty) (or any successor form); (iii) in the case of a
Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption under Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code,
a Form W-8BEN (claiming exemption from withholding under the portfolio interest
exemption) or any successor form; or (iv) any other applicable form, certificate
or document prescribed by the IRS certifying as to such Non-U.S. Lender's
entitlement to such exemption from United States withholding tax or reduced rate
with respect to all payments to be made to such Non-U.S. Lender under the Loan
Documents. Unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent have received forms


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments under any Loan
Document to or for a Non-U.S. Lender are not subject to United States
withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by an applicable
tax treaty, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall withhold amounts
required to be withheld by applicable Requirements of Law from such payments at
the applicable statutory rate.

                  (g) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall use its reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
that would be payable or may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole
determination of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  SECTION 2.16 SUBSTITUTION OF LENDERS.

                  In the event that (a) (i) any Lender makes a claim under
Section 2.13(c) or Section 2.14, or (ii) it becomes illegal for any Lender to
continue to fund or make any Eurodollar Rate Loan and such Lender notifies the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.13(d), or (iii) the Borrower is required to make
any payment pursuant to Section 2.15 that is attributable to any Lender, or (iv)
any Lender is a Non-Funding Lender, or (v) any Lender is a Rejecting Lender
pursuant to Section 2.17, (b) in the case of CLAUSE (A)(I) above, as a
consequence of increased costs in respect of which such claim is made, the
effective rate of interest payable to such Lender under this Agreement with
respect to its Loans materially exceeds the effective average annual rate of
interest payable to the Requisite Lenders under this Agreement and (c) Lenders
holding at least 75% of the Revolving Credit Commitments are not subject to such
increased costs or illegality, payment or proceedings (any such Lender, an
"AFFECTED LENDER"), the Borrower may substitute another financial institution
for such Affected Lender hereunder, upon reasonable prior written notice (which
written notice must be given within 90 days following the occurrence of any of
the events described in CLAUSES (A)(I), (II), (III) OR (IV)) by the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent and the Affected Lender that the Borrower intends to
make such substitution, which substitute financial institution must be an
Eligible Assignee and, if not a Lender, reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if more than one Lender claims
increased costs, illegality or right to payment arising from the same act or
condition and such claims are received by the Borrower within 30 days of each
other then the Borrower may substitute all, but not (except to the extent the
Borrower has already substituted one of such Affected Lenders before the
Borrower's receipt of the other Affected Lenders' claim) less than all, Lenders
making such claims. In the event that the proposed substitute financial
institution or other entity is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent
and the written notice was properly issued under this Section 2.16, the Affected
Lender shall sell and the substitute financial institution or other entity shall
purchase at par, pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, all rights and claims
of such Affected Lender under the Loan Documents and the substitute financial
institution or other entity shall assume and the Affected Lender shall be
relieved of its Revolving Credit Commitments and all other prior unperformed
obligations of the Affected Lender under the Loan Documents (other than in
respect of any damages (other than exemplary or punitive damages, to the extent
permitted by applicable law) in respect of any such unperformed obligations).
Upon the effectiveness of such sale, purchase and assumption (which, in any
event shall be conditioned upon the payment in full by the Borrower to the
Affected Lender in cash of all fees, unreimbursed costs and expenses and
indemnities accrued and unpaid through such effective date), the substitute


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

financial institution or other entity shall become a "LENDER" hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement having a Revolving Credit Commitment in the amount of
such Affected Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment assumed by it and such
Revolving Credit Commitment of the Affected Lender shall be terminated, provided
that all indemnities under the Loan Documents shall continue in favor of such
Affected Lender.

                  SECTION 2.17 FACILITY EXTENSION.

                  (a) EXTENSION REQUESTS. The Borrower may request a one-year
extension of the Scheduled Termination Date by submitting a request for an
extension to the Administrative Agent no more than 120 days nor less than 90
days prior to each anniversary of the Effective Date. At the time of or prior to
the delivery of such request, the Borrower shall propose to the Administrative
Agent the amount of the fees that the Borrower agrees to pay with respect to
such one-year extension if approved by Lenders (such request for an extension,
together with the fee proposal, being herein referred to as the "EXTENSION
REQUEST"). Promptly upon (but not later than five (5) Business Days after)
receipt of the Extension Request, the Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender of the contents thereof and shall request each Lender to approve the
Extension Request. Each Lender approving the Extension Request shall deliver its
written approval no later than sixty (60) days after the date of the Extension
Request. If the approval of all Lenders is received by the Administrative Agent
within sixty (60) days after the date of the Extension Request (or as otherwise
provided in Section 2.17(b)), the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify
the Borrower and each Lender, and the Scheduled Termination Date shall be
extended by one (1) year, and in such event the Borrower may thereafter request
further extension(s) of the then scheduled Scheduled Termination Date in
accordance with this Section 2.17. If any Lender does not deliver to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's written approval to any Extension Request
within sixty (60) days after the date of such Extension Request, the Scheduled
Termination Date shall not be extended, except as otherwise provided in Section
2.17(b) or 2.17(c).

                  (b) REJECTING LENDERS/FULL ASSIGNMENT. If (i) any Lenders
whose pro rata shares of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitment do not exceed
25% of the Aggregate Commitment ("REJECTING LENDERS") shall not approve an
Extension Request, (ii) all rights and obligations of such Rejecting Lenders
under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents and Guaranties
(including, without limitation, their Commitment and all Loans owing to them)
shall have been assigned, within ninety (90) days following such Extension
Request, in accordance with Section 2.16, to one or more replacement Lenders who
shall have approved in writing such Extension Request at the time of such
assignment, and (iii) no other Lender shall have given written notice to the
Administrative Agent of such Lender's withdrawal of its approval of the
Extension Request, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the
Borrower and each Lender, and the Scheduled Termination Date shall be extended
by one (1) year, and in such event the Borrower may thereafter request further
extension(s) as provided in Section 2.17(a).

                  (c) REJECTING LENDERS/NO FULL ASSIGNMENT. If (i) one or more
Rejecting Lenders shall not approve an Extension Request, (ii) the provisions of
clause (ii) of Section 2.17(b) do not apply and (iii) no other Lender shall have
given written notice to the Administrative Agent of such Lender's withdrawal of
its approval of the Extension Request, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and each Lender and any replacement Lender, and the
Scheduled Termination Date shall be extended by one (1) year (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 2.17(c)), and in such event the Borrower
may thereafter request further extension(s) as provided in Section 2.17(a);
provided, however, that (A) the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitment shall be
automatically reduced, effective as of the Scheduled Termination Date as
determined prior to such extension (the "PREVIOUS SCHEDULED TERMINATION DATE")
and shall equal the aggregate Commitments of Lenders who are not Rejecting
Lenders and Lenders who are replacement Lenders; (B) all rights and obligations
of such Rejecting Lenders under this Agreement and under the other Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, their Commitment and all Loans owing
to them) shall either be (1) assigned to replacement Lenders pursuant to Section
2.17(b), or (2) terminated, effective as of the previous Scheduled Termination
Date (or such earlier date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

designate, in which case the reduction of the aggregate Revolving Credit
Commitment provided for in clause (A) above shall occur on such earlier date);
(C) if and to the extent such Rejecting Lender's Commitment is assigned to one
or more replacement Lenders, such assignment shall be effected in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.16; and (D) if and to the extent such Rejecting
Lender's Commitment is terminated, the Borrower shall pay to Administrative
Agent on the date of such termination, solely for the account of such Rejecting
Lender, all amounts due and owing such Rejecting Lender hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, including without limitation the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Loans owed to such Rejecting Lender with respect to the
terminated Commitment, together with accrued interest thereon through the date
of such termination, all amounts payable under Section 2.13 and 2.14 with
respect to such Rejecting Lender and all fees payable to such Rejecting Lender
hereunder with respect to the terminated Commitment (and payment of such amount
may not be waived except with the consent of each Rejecting Lender, as more
specifically provided in Section 10.1(a)(ii)); and upon such Rejecting Lender's
termination, such Rejecting Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13 and 2.14 and Sections
10.3 and 10.4, as well as to any fees accrued hereunder and not yet paid, and
shall continue to be obligated under Section 9.5 with respect to obligations and
liabilities accruing prior to such termination of such Rejecting Lender's
Commitment.

                  (d) APPROVAL OF EXTENSION. Within ten (10) days after the
Administrative Agent's notice to the Borrower that all (or some, as applicable)
of Lenders have approved an Extension Request (whether pursuant to Section
2.17(a), (b) or (c)), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender approving the extension and each Replacement Lender an
extension fee in the amount provided in the Extension Request.

                  (e) NO DEFAULT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no extension of the Scheduled Termination Date may be effected
under this Section 2.17 if (x) a Default or Event of Default shall be in
existence on the effective date of such extension or would occur after giving
effect thereto or (y) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the
Borrower in any Loan Document or any Guarantor in any Guaranty is not or would
not be true or correct in any material respect on the effective date of such
increase (except to the extent any such representation or warranty is stated to
relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representation or warranty
shall be true and correct on and as of such earlier date).

                  SECTION 2.18 FACILITY INCREASE.

                  The Borrower may request, in writing, an increase in the
aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments by up to the sum of (x) $150,000,000 and
(y) the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Rejecting
Lenders that have been terminated on their Scheduled Termination Date (the
"FACILITY INCREASE"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such increase will only become
effective if (i) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent at least
10 Business Days' notice of its intention to effect a Facility Increase and the
desired amount of such Facility Increase, (ii) at the time of and after giving
effect to such increase, the Borrower is in PRO FORMA compliance with the
financial covenants set forth in ARTICLE V hereof, (iii) no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, and (iv) the
conditions precedent to a Borrowing set forth in Section 3.2 are satisfied as of
such date. The Borrower shall have the right to offer such increase to (x) the
existing Lenders, and each existing Lender will have the right, but not the
obligation, to commit to all or a portion of the proposed increase or (y) other
Eligible Assignees acceptable to the Administrative Agent and each Issuer in its
respective sole and absolute discretion; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the minimum
Revolving Credit Commitment of each such new Eligible Assignee accepting a
Revolving Credit Commitment as part of such Facility Increase equals or exceeds
$5,000,000, and such Lender or Eligible Assignee executes an Assumption


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

Agreement pursuant to which such Lender agrees to commit to all or a portion of
such Facility Increase and, in the case of an Eligible Assignee, to be bound by
the terms of this Agreement as a Lender. On the effective date provided for in
the Assumption Agreement providing for a Facility Increase (each a "FACILITY
INCREASE EFFECTIVE DATE"), the Revolving Credit Commitments will be increased by
the amount committed to by each Lender or Eligible Assignee on the Facility
Increase Effective Date. In the event there are Lenders and Eligible Assignees
that have committed to a Facility Increase in excess of the maximum amount
requested (or permitted), then the Administrative Agent shall have the right to
allocate such commitments, first to Lenders and then to Eligible Assignees, on
whatever basis the Administrative Agent determines is appropriate in
consultation with the Borrower.

<PAGE>

                  (a) REQUEST FOR BORROWING OR ISSUANCE OF LETTER OF CREDIT.

                  With respect to any Loan, the Administrative Agent shall have

duly executed Swing Loan Request) and with respect to any Letter of Credit, the

documents, information and materials as any Lender, through the Administrative
Agent, may reasonably request.

Each submission by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of
Borrowing or a Swing Loan Request and the acceptance by the Borrower of the
proceeds of each Loan requested therein, and each submission by the Borrower to
an Issuer of a Letter of Credit Request and the Issuance of each Letter of
Credit requested therein, shall be deemed to constitute a representation and
warranty by the Borrower as to the matters specified in Section 3.2(b) on the

                  SECTION 3.3 DETERMINATIONS OF INITIAL BORROWING CONDITIONS.

specified in Section 3.1, each Lender shall be deemed to have consented to,
approved, accepted or be satisfied with, each document or other matter required
thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to
the Lenders unless an officer of the Administrative Agent responsible for the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents shall have received notice from
such Lender prior to the initial Borrowing or Issuance hereunder specifying its
objection thereto and such Lender shall not have made available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's Ratable Portion of such Borrowing.

any agreement restricting the transfer or hypothecation of any Stock of any such
Restricted Subsidiary, other than (i) the Loan Documents and (ii) such customary
restrictions related to the interest of the Borrower and its Restricted

present the Consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries as at such date and the Consolidated results of the operations of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the period ended on such date, all in
conformity with GAAP (subject, in the case of the financial statements as of and
for the period ended June 30, 2004, to normal year-end adjustments and to the
absence of notes).

                  (b) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.4, neither the Borrower

not otherwise permitted by this Agreement.

                  (c) The One Year Projections were prepared by the Borrower in
light of the past operations of its business, and reflect projections for the
three year period beginning on January 1, 2003 on a quarterly basis. The One
Year Projections are based upon estimates and assumptions stated therein, that
the Borrower believes in each case to be reasonable and fair in light of current


                                      -46-
<PAGE>

to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened actions, investigations or
proceedings affecting the Borrower, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries before
any court, Governmental Authority or arbitrator other than those that in the
aggregate are not reasonably likely to be determined adversely to any Loan Party
and, if so determined, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The performance
of any action by any Loan Party required or contemplated by any Loan Documents
is not restrained or enjoined (either temporarily, preliminarily or
permanently).

                  SECTION 4.7 TAXES.

and correct in all material respects, and all taxes, charges and other
impositions reflected therein have been paid prior to the date on which any
fine, penalty, interest, late charge or loss may be added thereto for
non-payment thereof except where contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings if adequate reserves therefor have been established on the books of
the Borrower or such Tax Affiliate in conformity with GAAP. Except as set forth
on SCHEDULE 4.7, no Tax Return is under audit or examination by any Governmental
Authority and no notice of such an audit or examination or any assertion of any
claim for Taxes has been given or made by any Governmental Authority. Proper and
accurate amounts have been withheld by the Borrower and each of its Tax
Affiliates from their respective employees for all periods in full and complete
compliance with the tax, social security and unemployment withholding provisions
of applicable Requirements of Law and such withholdings have been timely paid to
the respective Governmental Authorities.

assessment or collection of any charges, (ii) incurred any obligation under any
tax sharing agreement or arrangement other than those of which the
Administrative Agent has received a copy prior to the date hereof, or (iii) been
a member of an affiliated, combined or unitary group other than the group of

including the information contained in the Disclosure Documents, does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein or herein not misleading.

following:

                  (a) promptly and in any event within 10 days after the
         Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate knows or has
         reason to know that any ERISA Event reasonably likely to result in a

         recent actuarial valuation report for each Title IV Plan; (iii) all
         notices received by the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate from a
         Multiemployer Plan sponsor or any governmental agency concerning an
         ERISA Event; and (iv) such other documents or governmental reports or
         filings relating to any Title IV Plan (or employee benefit plan
         sponsored or contributed to by any Company) as the Administrative Agent

                  (h) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  The Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent
promptly and in any event within 10 days after receipt by Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary, a copy of (i) any written notice or claim to the effect
that the Borrower or any Subsidiary is or may be liable to any Person as a
result of a Release or threatened Release or any toxic or hazardous waste or

                  (i) BORROWING BASE DETERMINATION.

                  (i) No later than 30 days after the last day of each calendar
         month or more frequently as requested by the Administrative Agent, the
         Borrower shall provide a Borrowing Base Certificate as of the first day
         of such month executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. The
         Borrower agrees that each Borrowing Base Certificate delivered by the
         Borrower shall be accompanied by appropriate supporting data and shall
         not be deemed delivered until verified by the Administrative Agent to
         the Administrative Agent's satisfaction. Upon verification by the
         Administrative Agent, each Borrowing Base Certificate shall be deemed
         delivered for purposes of determining the Borrowing Base as of the date
         of its actual delivery. The Borrower agrees that the Administrative
         Agent in the process of its verification may determine, in its
         reasonable discretion, the particular category to which any Borrowing
         Base Asset belongs.

                  (ii) The Administrative Agent may (prior to the occurrence of
         an Event of Default, at its sole cost and expense and with 14 days
         prior written notice to the Borrower, and, after and during the
         continuance of an Event of Default, at the Borrower's sole cost and
         expense) make physical verifications of the Borrowing Base Assets in
         any manner and through any medium that the Administrative Agent
         considers advisable, and the Borrower shall furnish all such assistance
         and information as the Administrative Agent may require in connection
         therewith.

                  SECTION 6.3 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC.

                  The Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Restricted

preserve its business and the goodwill and business of the customers,
advertisers, suppliers and others having business relations with the Borrower or

                  SECTION 6.7 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.

TOSI of up to $3,500,000 in any fiscal year under the Management Services


                                      -55-

Subsidiaries.

                  SECTION 6.9 KEEPING OF BOOKS.

its Restricted Subsidiaries promptly to, in the case of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Domestic Subsidiary owning 5% or more of the Total Assets
of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries or contributing 5% or more of
the Consolidated Net Income of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for
the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters, cause such Restricted Subsidiary
to become a party to the Guaranty. Notwithstanding anything herein to the

than those Subsidiaries engaged in the business of originating residential home
loans, title insurance and reinsurance) that are not Guarantors own, in the
aggregate for all such Subsidiaries, 5% or more of the Total Assets of the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries or contribute 5% or more of the
Consolidated Net Income of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the
immediately preceding four fiscal quarters, the Borrower shall promptly cause
such number of its Subsidiaries to become a party to the Guaranty so that the
Subsidiaries of the Borrower that are not Guarantors do not own, in the
aggregate for all such Subsidiaries, 5% or more of the Total Assets of the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries or contribute 5% or more of the
Consolidated Net Income of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the
immediately preceding four fiscal quarters. In the event that any Subsidiary of
the Borrower incurs, or has outstanding (including, without limitation, the
Senior Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes) any guaranty obligation in
respect of other Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, the
Borrower or any Guarantor shall promptly cause such Subsidiary to become a party
to the Guaranty.

                  SECTION 6.14 DESIGNATION OF RESTRICTED AND UNRESTRICTED
         SUBSIDIARIES.

                  The Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary of the
Borrower to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if the Subsidiary to be so designated:

                  (a) does not own any Stock or Indebtedness of, or own or hold
         any Lien on any property of, the Borrower or any other Restricted

         to be either a Restricted Subsidiary or a Guarantor;

                  (b) has no Indebtedness other than Indebtedness:

                           (1) as to which neither the Borrower nor any of its

                  kind (including any undertaking, agreement or instrument that
                  would constitute Indebtedness), (B) is directly or indirectly
                  liable as a Guarantor or otherwise, or (C) constitutes the
                  lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Borrower or a Restricted
                  Subsidiary may loan, advance or extend credit to, or Guaranty
                  the Indebtedness of, an Unrestricted Subsidiary at any time
                  following the date such Subsidiary is designated as an
                  Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with this Section 6.14;
                  and

                           (2) no default with respect to which (including any
                  rights that the holders thereof may have to take enforcement
                  action against an Unrestricted Subsidiary) would permit upon
                  notice, lapse of time or both any holder of any other
                  Indebtedness (other any Guaranty permitted by the proviso to
                  the preceding CLAUSE (1)) of the Borrower or any of its
                  Restricted Subsidiaries to declare a default on such other
                  Indebtedness or cause the payment thereof to be accelerated or
                  payable prior to its stated maturity;


                                      -57-
<PAGE>

                  (c) is not party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or
         understanding with the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
         Borrower unless the terms of any such agreement, contract, arrangement
         or understanding are no less favorable to the Borrower or such
         Restricted Subsidiary than those that might be obtained at the time
         from Persons who are not Affiliates of the Borrower;

                  (d) is a Person with respect to which neither the Borrower nor
         any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect
         obligation (1) to subscribe for additional Stock or (2) to maintain or
         preserve such Person's financial condition or to cause such Person to
         achieve any specified levels of operating results;

                  (e) has not guaranteed or otherwise directly or indirectly
         provided credit support for any Indebtedness of the Borrower or any of
         its Restricted Subsidiaries; and

                  (f) has at least one director on its board of directors that
         is not a director or executive officer of the Borrower or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries and has at least one executive officer that is
         not a director or executive officer of the Borrower or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries.

                  Unless so designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, any Person
that is or becomes a Subsidiary of the Borrower will be classified as a
Restricted Subsidiary.

                  Upon designation of a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in compliance with this covenant, such Restricted Subsidiary shall be
released from any Guaranty previously made by such Restricted Subsidiary.

                  The Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, if, immediately after giving PRO FORMA
effect to such designation, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing or would result therefrom.

                  Any such designation or redesignation by the Board of
Directors will be evidenced to the Administrative Agent by filing with the
Administrative Agent (within five Business Days after adoption of such
resolution) a board resolution giving effect to such designation or
redesignation and an officers' certificate signed by two Responsible Officers
that:

                  (a) certifies that such designation or redesignation complies
         with the preceding provisions; and

                  (b) gives the effective date of such designation or
         redesignation.

                  The Company shall not enter into, or permit a Restricted
Subsidiary to enter into, any transaction with an Unrestricted Subsidiary that,
if in effect at the time of designation of such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, would be inconsistent with the above restrictions as to designation
of Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

by notice to the Borrower declare that all or any portion of the Revolving
Credit Commitments be terminated, whereupon the obligation of each Lender to
make any Loan and each Issuer to Issue any Letter of Credit shall immediately be
decreased or terminate, as the case may be, and/or (b) may, and at the request
of the Requisite Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, declare the Loans,
all interest thereon and all other amounts and Obligations payable under this
Agreement to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Loans, all such
interest and all such amounts and Obligations shall immediately become and be
forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that upon the occurrence of the Events of Default specified
in Section 8.1(f)(ii), the Revolving Credit Commitments of each Lender to make
Loans and the commitments of each Lender and Issuer to Issue or participate in
Letters of Credit shall each automatically be terminated and the Loans, all such
interest and all such amounts and Obligations shall automatically become and be
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

                  SECTION 8.3 ACTIONS IN RESPECT OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.

Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent's office
referred to in Section 10.8, for deposit in a cash collateral account, an amount
equal to 102.5% of the sum of all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations or
(y) make such other arrangements in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit as
shall be acceptable to the Requisite Lenders. Amounts held in such cash
collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment
of Reimbursement Obligations, and the unused portion thereof after all such
Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be
applied in accordance with clause (f) of Section 2.12. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly give notice of any such application; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
failure to give such written notice shall not invalidate any such application.
Promptly after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn
upon and all other obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under the Revolving
Credit Notes shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such cash
collateral account shall be returned to the Borrower.

                  SECTION 8.4 RESCISSION.

                  If at any time after termination of the Revolving Credit
Commitments and/or acceleration of the maturity of the Loans, the Borrower shall
pay all arrears of interest and all payments on account of principal of the
Loans and Reimbursement Obligations that shall have become due otherwise than by
acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent permitted by law, on
overdue interest, at the rates specified herein) and all Events of Default and
Defaults (other than non-payment of principal of and accrued interest on the
Loans due and payable solely by virtue of acceleration) shall be remedied or
waived pursuant to Section 10.1, then upon the written consent of the Requisite
Lenders and written notice to the Borrower, the termination of the Revolving
Credit Commitments and/or the acceleration and their consequences may be
rescinded and annulled; PROVIDED, however, that such action shall not affect any
subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right or remedy consequent
thereon. The provisions of the preceding sentence are intended merely to bind
the Lenders and the Issuers to a decision that may be made at the election of
the Requisite Lenders; and such provisions are not intended to benefit the
Borrower and do not give the Borrower the right to require the Lenders to
rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder, even if the conditions set forth
herein are met.

                  (a) Each Lender and each Issuer hereby appoints CNAI as the
Administrative Agent hereunder and each Lender and each Issuer authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated
to the Administrative Agent under such agreements and to exercise such powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender
and each Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute and
deliver, and to perform its obligations under, each of the Loan Documents to
which the Administrative Agent is a party and to exercise all rights, powers and
remedies that the Administrative Agent may have under such Loan Documents
pursuant to which the Administrative Agent is acting as agent for the Lenders
and the Issuers.

                  (b) As to any matters not expressly provided for by this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including enforcement or collection),
the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or
take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and
shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the
instructions of the Requisite Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding
upon all Lenders and each Issuer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrative
Agent shall not be required to take any action that (i) the Administrative Agent
in good faith believes exposes it to personal liability unless the
Administrative Agent receives an indemnification satisfactory to it from the
Lenders and the Issuers with respect to such action or (ii) is contrary to this
Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees to give to each
Lender and each Issuer prompt notice of each notice given to it by any Loan
Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

                  (c) In performing its functions and duties hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent is acting solely on behalf of
the Lenders and the Issuers and its duties are entirely administrative in
nature. The Administrative Agent does not assume and shall not be deemed to have
assumed any obligation other than as expressly set forth herein and in the other
Loan Documents or any other relationship as the agent, fiduciary or trustee of


                                      -65-
<PAGE>

or for any Lender, Issuer or holder of any other Obligation. The Administrative
Agent may perform any of its duties under any Loan Document by or through its
agents or employees.

                  SECTION 9.2 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC.

                  None of the Administrative Agent, any of its Affiliates or any
of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it, him, her or them under or in
connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for its, his,
her or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent (a) may treat the payee of any Revolving
Credit Note as its holder until such Revolving Credit Note has been assigned in
accordance with Section 10.2, (b) may rely on the Register to the extent set
forth in Section 10.2(c), (c) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel
to the Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent public accountants and
other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such
counsel, accountants or experts, (d) makes no warranty or representation to any
Lender or Issuer and shall not be responsible to any Lender or Issuer for any
statements, warranties or representations made by or on behalf of the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries in or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, (e) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire either as
to the performance or observance of any terms, covenant or condition of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, as to the financial condition of any Loan
Party or as to the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of
Default; (f) shall not be responsible to any Lender or Issuer for the due
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of, or the attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien created or purported
to be created under or in connection with, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or
thereto; and (g) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or
other instrument or writing (which may be a telecopy or electronic mail) or any
telephone message believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

                  SECTION 9.3 THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT INDIVIDUALLY.

                  With respect to its Ratable Portion, CNAI shall have and may
exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same
obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other
Lender. The terms "LENDERS" or "REQUISITE LENDERS," "LENDERS," and any similar
terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include, without
limitation, the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender or
as one of the Requisite Lenders. CNAI and its Affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other
business with any Loan Party as if CNAI were not acting as the Administrative
Agent.

                  SECTION 9.4 LENDER CREDIT DECISION.

                  Each Lender and each Issuer acknowledges that it shall,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender conduct its own independent investigation of the financial condition and
affairs of the Borrower and each other Loan Party in connection with the making
and continuance of the Loans and with the issuance of the Letters of Credit.
Each Lender and each Issuer also acknowledges that it shall, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and other Loan Documents.

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 9.5 INDEMNIFICATION.

                  Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and
each of its Affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and advisors (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower),
from and against such Lender's aggregate Ratable Portion of any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses and disbursements (including reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of financial and legal advisors) of any kind or nature whatsoever
that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, the Administrative
Agent or any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
advisors in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender
shall be liable to the Administrative Agent and any of its Affiliates, and any
of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such
Administrative Agent's, Affiliates', directors', officers', employees', agents'
or advisors' gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly
upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of financial and legal advisors)
incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of its rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower or another Loan Party.

                  SECTION 9.6 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

                  The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Requisite Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, selected from among the
Lenders. In either case, such appointment shall be subject to the prior written
approval of the Borrower (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld and
shall not be required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent by a
successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. Prior to any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent shall take
such action as may be reasonably necessary to assign to the successor
Administrative Agent its rights as Administrative Agent under the Loan
Documents. After such resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent shall
continue to have the benefit of this Article IX as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Administrative Agent shall resign if at any time the Administrative Agent is
not a Lender having a Revolving Credit Commitment of at least $10,000,000 (or
such ratably lesser amount if the Revolving Credit Commitments have been reduced
in accordance with this Agreement).

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 10.1 AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC.

                  (a) No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document nor consent to any departure by any Loan Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Requisite Lenders (or by the Administrative Agent with the
consent of the Requisite Lenders) and, in the case of any amendment, by the
Borrower, and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by each Lender affected thereby, in addition to the Requisite Lenders, do
any of the following:

                  (i) increase the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender or
         subject such Lender to any additional obligation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
         that, except as provided in Section 2.18, any such increase in the
         Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender shall require the consent of
         all Lenders;

                  (ii) extend the then scheduled final maturity of any Loan
         owing to such Lender, except as provided in Section 2.17;

                  (iii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or Reimbursement
         Obligation owing to such Lender (other than by the payment or
         prepayment thereof);

                  (iv) reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or Reimbursement
         Obligations outstanding to such Lender or any fee payable hereunder to
         such Lender;

                  (v) postpone any scheduled date fixed for payment of such
         interest or fees owing to such Lender;

                  (vi) change the aggregate Ratable Portions of Lenders required
         for any or all Lenders to take any action hereunder;

                  (vii) release the Borrower from its payment obligation to such
         Lender under this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Notes owing to such
         Lender (if any) or release any Guarantor from its obligations under the
         Guaranty except in connection with sale or other disposition of a
         Guarantor (or all or substantially all of the assets thereof) or as
         otherwise specifically provided herein; or

                  (viii) amend this Section 10.1 or the definition of the term
         "REQUISITE LENDERS";

and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the Administrative Agent, the Issuer or the Swing Loan
Lender, as the case may be, in addition to the Lenders required above to take
such action, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuer
or the Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents.

                  (b) The Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation
to, with the written concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments,
modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of such Lender. Any waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any


                                      -68-
<PAGE>

case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances.

                  (c) If, in connection with any proposed amendment,
modification, waiver or termination (a "PROPOSED CHANGE") requiring the consent
of all affected Lenders, the consent of Requisite Lenders is obtained, but the
consent of other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such
Lender whose consent is not obtained as described in this Section 10.1 being
referred to as a "NON-CONSENTING LENDER"), then, so long as the Lender that is
acting as the Administrative Agent is not a Non-Consenting Lender, at the
Borrower's request, each other Lender shall have a right to purchase its PRO
RATA share of such Non-Consenting Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment and
Revolving Credit Outstandings, and if such Lenders do not purchase all of such
Non-Consenting Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment or Revolving Credit
Outstandings, an Eligible Assignee acceptable to the Administrative Agent shall
have the right with the Administrative Agent's consent and in the Administrative
Agent's sole discretion (but shall have no obligation) to purchase from such
Non-Consenting Lender, and such Non-Consenting Lender agrees that it shall, upon
the Administrative Agent's request, sell and assign to the Lender acting as the
Administrative Agent or such Eligible Assignee, all of the Revolving Credit
Commitments, and Revolving Credit Outstandings of such Non-Consenting Lender for
an amount equal to the principal balance of all Loans held by the Non-Consenting
Lender and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto and all other
amounts through the date of sale, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such purchase and sale
shall not be effective until the Administrative Agent shall have received from
such Eligible Assignee an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower whereby such Eligible Assignee shall agree
to be bound by the terms hereof. Each Lender agrees that, if it becomes a
Non-Consenting Lender, it shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent
an Assignment an Acceptance to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver
to the Administrative Agent any Revolving Credit Note (if the assigning Lender's
Loans are evidenced by a Revolving Credit Note) subject to such Assignment and
Acceptance; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of any Non-Consenting Lender to
execute an Assignment and Acceptance shall not render such sale and purchase
(and the corresponding assignment) invalid.

                  SECTION 10.2 ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

                  (a) Each Lender may sell, transfer, negotiate or assign to one
or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations
hereunder (including all of its rights and obligations with respect to the
Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans and the Letters of Credit); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that (i) if any such assignment shall be of the assigning Lender's Revolving
Credit Outstandings and Revolving Credit Commitments, such assignment shall
cover the same percentage of such Lender's Revolving Credit Outstandings and
Revolving Credit Commitments, (ii) the aggregate amount being assigned pursuant
to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and
Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event (if less than the
Assignor's entire interest) be less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof, except, in either case, (A) with the consent of
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or (B) if such assignment is being
made to a Lender or an Affiliate or Approved Fund of such Lender, and (iii) if
such Eligible Assignee is not, prior to the date of such assignment, a Lender or
an Affiliate or Approved Fund of a Lender, such assignment shall be subject to
the prior consent of the Administrative Agent, the Swing Loan Lender, each
Issuer and the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 10.2, the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for any
assignment occurring when any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.

                  (b) The parties to each such assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording, an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Revolving Credit Note (if the


                                      -69-
<PAGE>

assigning Lender's Loans are evidenced by a Revolving Credit Note) subject to
such assignment. In addition, any Lender or Eligible Assignee assuming a
Revolving Credit Commitment in connection with a Facility Increase shall execute
an Assumption Agreement in accordance with Section 2.18. Upon such execution,
delivery, acceptance and recording of any Assignment and Acceptance or
Assumption Agreement, as the case may be, and, other than in respect of
assignment made pursuant to Section 2.16 and Section 10.1(c), the receipt by the
Administrative Agent from the assignee of an assignment/assumption fee in the
amount of $3,500, then from and after the effective date specified in such
Assignment and Acceptance or Assumption Agreement, as the case may be, (i) the
assignee thereunder shall become a party hereto and, to the extent that rights
and obligations under the Loan Documents have been assigned to such assignee
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance or assumed by such assuming party
pursuant to such Assumption Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a
Lender, and, in the case of an assignment, if such Lender were an Issuer, of
such Issuer hereunder and thereunder, and (ii) the assignor under an Assignment
and Acceptance shall, to the extent that rights and obligations under this
Agreement have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights (except for those surviving the payment in full of the
Obligations) and be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents,
other than those relating to events or circumstances occurring prior to such
assignment (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the
remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

                  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 10.8 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance and each
Assumption Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the
recording of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Revolving Credit
Commitments of and principal amount of the Loans and Letter of Credit
Obligations owing to each Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER"). Any
assignment pursuant to this Section 10.2 shall not be effective until such
assignment is recorded in the Register. The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Loan
Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register as a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time
upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
clause (b) above, the Loans (including the Revolving Credit Notes evidencing
such Loans) are registered obligations and the right, title, and interest of the
Lenders and their assignees in and to such Loans shall be transferable only upon
notation of such transfer in the Register. A Revolving Credit Note shall only
evidence the Lender's or an assignee's right, title and interest in and to the
related Loan, and in no event is any such Revolving Credit Note to be considered
a bearer instrument or obligation. This Section 10.2 shall be construed so that
the Loans are at all times maintained in "REGISTERED FORM" within the meaning of
Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code or such
regulations. Solely for purposes of this and for tax purposes only, the
Administrative Agent shall act as the Borrower's agent for purposes of
maintaining such notations of transfer in the Register.

                  (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender and an assignee or an Assumption Agreement executed by
the Borrower and a Lender or an Eligible Assignee, the Administrative Agent
shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance or Assumption Agreement has been
completed, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance or Assumption Agreement,
(ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance, give prompt notice thereof to the
Borrower. Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the
Borrower, at its own expense, shall, if requested by such assignee, execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent, new Revolving Credit Notes to the order of
such assignee in an amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitments assumed by


                                      -70-
<PAGE>

it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance or Assumption Agreement and, if
the assigning Lender, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance, has
surrendered any Revolving Credit Note for exchange in connection with the
assignment and has retained Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder, new
Revolving Credit Notes to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal
to the Revolving Credit Commitments retained by it hereunder. Such new Revolving
Credit Notes shall be dated the same date as the surrendered Revolving Credit
Notes and be in substantially the form of EXHIBIT C.

                  (f) In addition to the other assignment rights provided in
this Section 10.2, each Lender may assign, as collateral or otherwise, any of
its rights under this Agreement, whether now owned or hereafter acquired
(including rights to payments of principal or interest on the Loans), to (x) any
Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board
without notice to or consent of the Borrower or (y) in the case of any Lender
that is a Fund, any holders of obligations owed or Securities issued by such
Lender as security for such obligations or Securities or any trustee for, or
other representative of, such holders, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
hereto.

                  (g) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more Persons
in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents
(including all its rights and obligations with respect to the Revolving Loans
and Letters of Credit). The terms of such participation shall not, in any event,
require the participant's consent to any amendments, waivers or other
modifications of any provision of any Loan Documents, the consent to any
departure by any Loan Party therefrom, or to the exercising or refraining from
exercising any powers or rights such Lender may have under or in respect of the
Loan Documents (including the right to enforce the obligations of the Loan
Parties), except if any such amendment, waiver or other modification or consent
would reduce the amount, or postpone any date fixed for, any amount (whether of
principal, interest or fees) payable to such participant under the Loan
Documents, to which such participant would otherwise be entitled under such
participation. In the event of the sale of any participation by any Lender, (w)
such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (x)
such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties for the
performance of such obligations, (y) such Lender shall remain the holder of such
Obligations for all purposes of this Agreement, and (z) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Each participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 2.14 and Section 2.15 and of Section 2.13(c) as if it were a
Lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Borrower shall not, at any time, be obligated to make under Section 2.14,
Section 2.15 or Section 2.13(c) to the participant in the rights and obligations
of any Lender (together with such Lender) any payment in excess of the amount
the Borrower would have been obligated to pay to such Lender in respect of such
interest had such participation not been sold.

                  (h) Any Issuer may at any time assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to any other Lender by an instrument in form and substance
satisfactory to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, such Issuer and such
Eligible Assignee. If any Issuer ceases to be a Lender hereunder by virtue of
any assignment made pursuant to this Section 10.2, then, as of the effective
date of such cessation, such Issuer's obligations to Issue Letters of Credit
pursuant to Section 2.4 shall terminate and such Issuer shall be an Issuer
hereunder only with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit issued prior to
such date.

Administrative Agent for, all of the Administrative Agent's reasonable internal

and reproduction and investigation expenses and for all other reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of every type and nature (including, without
limitation, after receipt of invoice documentation, the reasonable fees,

by the Administrative Agent in connection with any of the following: (i) the
Administrative Agent's audit and investigation of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation, negotiation or execution of any
Loan Document, (ii) the preparation, negotiation, execution or interpretation of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, the satisfaction or attempted
satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Article III), any Loan Document or
any proposal letter or commitment letter issued in connection therewith or the
making of the Loans hereunder, (iii) the ongoing administration of this
Agreement and the Loans, including consultation with attorneys in connection
therewith and with respect to the Administrative Agent's rights and
responsibilities hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (iv) the
protection, collection or enforcement of any Obligation or the enforcement of
any Loan Document, (v) the commencement, defense or intervention in any court
proceeding relating in any way to the Obligations, any Loan Party, any of the
Borrower's Subsidiaries, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (vi) the
response to, and preparation for, any subpoena or request for document
production with which the Administrative Agent is served or deposition or other
proceeding in which the Administrative Agent is called to testify, in each case,
relating in any way to the Obligations, any Loan Party, any of the Borrower's
Subsidiaries, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or (vii) any amendment,
consent, waiver, assignment, restatement, or supplement to any Loan Document or
the preparation, negotiation, and execution of the same.

                  (b) The Borrower further agrees to pay or reimburse the
Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders and Issuers upon demand for all
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees (including allocated costs of internal counsel and costs of
settlement), incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lenders or Issuers in
connection with any of the following: (i) in enforcing any Loan Document or
Obligation or any security therefor or exercising or enforcing any other right
or remedy available by reason of an Event of Default, (ii) in connection with
any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided hereunder

(iii) in commencing, defending or intervening in any litigation or in filing a
petition, complaint, answer, motion or other pleadings in any legal proceeding
relating to the Obligations, any Loan Party, any of the Borrower's Subsidiaries
and related to or arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby or by any
other Loan Document or (iv) in taking any other action in or with respect to any
suit or proceeding (bankruptcy or otherwise) described in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) above.

                  SECTION 10.4 INDEMNITIES.

                  (a) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent, each Arranger, each Lender and each of their respective
Affiliates, and each of the directors, officers, employees, agents,
representative, attorneys, consultants and advisors of or to any of the
foregoing (including those retained in connection with the satisfaction or
attempted satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III (each such
Person being an "INDEMNITEE") from and against any and all claims, damages,
liabilities, obligations, losses, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
disbursements and expenses of any kind or nature (including fees, disbursements
and expenses of financial and legal advisors to any such Indemnitee) that may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in connection
with or arising out of any investigation, litigation or proceeding, whether or
not any such Indemnitee is a party thereto, whether direct, indirect, or
consequential and whether based on any federal, state or local law or other


                                      -72-
<PAGE>

statutory regulation, securities or commercial law or regulation, or under
common law or in equity, or on contract, tort or otherwise, in any manner
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any
Obligation, any Letter of Credit, the Disclosure Document, the Revolving Credit
Notes or any act, event or transaction related or attendant to any thereof, or
the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans or Letters of Credit or in
connection with any investigation of any potential matter covered hereby
(collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED MATTERS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrower
shall not have any obligation under this Section 10.4 to an Indemnitee with
respect to any Indemnified Matter caused by or resulting from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee, as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment or order. Without
limiting the foregoing, Indemnified Matters include (i) all environmental
liabilities and costs arising from or connected with the past, present or future
operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or damage to real or
personal property or natural resources or harm or injury alleged to have
resulted from any Release of Contaminants; (ii) any costs or liabilities
incurred in connection with any Remedial Action concerning any Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries; (iii) any costs or liabilities incurred in connection with
any Environmental Lien and (iv) any costs or liabilities incurred in connection
with any other matter under any Environmental Law, including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (49 U.S.C. 9601
ET SEQ.) and applicable state property transfer laws, except, with respect to
those matters referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, to the
extent attributable to acts of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such
Issuer or any agent on behalf of the Administrative Agent, such lender or such
Issuer. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which
the indemnity in this Section 10.4 applies, such indemnity shall be effective
whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the
Borrower, any of its directors, securityholders or creditors, an Indemnitee or
any other person, or an Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto and whether or
not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.

                  (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders and each Issuer for, and hold the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and
each Issuer harmless from and against, any and all claims for brokerage
commissions, fees and other compensation made against the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders and the Issuers for any broker, finder or consultant with respect to
any agreement, arrangement or understanding made by or on behalf of any Loan
Party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (c) The Borrower, at the request of any Indemnitee, shall have
the obligation to defend against such investigation, litigation or proceeding or
requested Remedial Action and the Borrower, in any event, may participate in the
defense thereof with legal counsel of the Borrower's choice. In the event that
such Indemnitee requests the Borrower to defend against such investigation,
litigation or proceeding or requested Remedial Action, the Borrower shall
promptly do so and such Indemnitee shall have the right to have legal counsel of
its choice participate in such defense. No action taken by legal counsel chosen
by such Indemnitee in defending against any such investigation, litigation or
proceeding or requested Remedial Action, shall vitiate or in any way impair the
Borrower's obligation and duty hereunder to indemnify and hold harmless such
Indemnitee.

                  (d) The Borrower agrees that any indemnification or other
protection provided to any Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement (including
pursuant to this Section 10.4) or any other Loan Document shall (i) survive
payment in full of the Obligations and (ii) inure to the benefit of any Person
that was at any time an Indemnitee under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

                  SECTION 10.5 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

                  The Borrower agrees that no Indemnitee shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) to any Loan Party or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective equity holders or
creditors for or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and in
the other Loan Documents, except for direct damages (as opposed to special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (including, without limitation, any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings)) determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower
hereby waives, releases and agrees (each for itself and on behalf of its
Subsidiaries) not to sue upon any such claim for any special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not
known or suspected to exist in its favor.

                  SECTION 10.6 RIGHT OF SET-OFF.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default each Lender and each Affiliate of a Lender is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off
and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such
Lender or its Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any and all of the Obligations now or hereafter existing whether or not
such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and even though such Obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees
promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by
such Lender or its Affiliates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights
of each Lender under this Section 10.6 are in addition to the other rights and
remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 10.7 SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC.

                  (a) If any Lender obtains any payment (whether voluntary,
involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) of the
Loans owing to it, any interest thereon, fees in respect thereof or amounts due
pursuant to Section 10.3 or Section 10.4 (other than payments pursuant to
Section 2.14, Section 2.15 or Section 2.16 in excess of its Ratable Portion of
all payments of such Obligations obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender (a
"PURCHASING LENDER") shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders (each, a
"SELLING LENDER") such participations in their Loans or other Obligations as
shall be necessary to cause such Purchasing Lender to share the excess payment
ratably with each of them.

                  (b) If all or any portion of any payment received by a
Purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from such Purchasing Lender, such
purchase from each Selling Lender shall be rescinded and such Selling Lender
shall repay to the Purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such
recovery together with an amount equal to such Selling Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Selling Lender's required
repayment in relation to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the Purchasing
Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the Purchasing Lender
in respect of the total amount so recovered.

                  (c) The Borrower agrees that any Purchasing Lender so
purchasing a participation from a Selling Lender pursuant to this Section 10.7
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.
