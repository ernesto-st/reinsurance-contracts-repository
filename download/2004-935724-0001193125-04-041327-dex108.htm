senior management of the parties for resolution by delivery of a written notice to the other party (the &#147;<B>Notice of Dispute</B>&#148;). If the senior management is not able to resolve the matter after a period of thirty (30) days, the parties
shall submit the dispute to non-binding mediation through the offices of Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services (&#147;<B>JAMS</B>&#148;) or its successor in San Francisco, California. The parties shall select a mutually agreeable mediator from the
list of available mediators provided by JAMS; provided, however, that the parties shall select a mediator whose schedule permits a mediation within thirty (30) days after contacting JAMS, unless the parties mutually agree to an extension of time to
have the matter mediated at a later date. If the parties are unable to agree upon an available mediator from the list provided by JAMS whose time schedule permits a mediation within said thirty (30) days, and there is no agreement to extend such
time, the parties shall accept an assignment of a mediator from JAMS who may be disqualified only for bias. The parties shall inform JAMS of the nature of the dispute so that it may recommend a mediator most qualified to help the parties to resolve
the dispute. Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing, in the event that a written settlement of the dispute is not made within 120 days following the date of the Notice of Dispute, and the parties have not agreed upon an extension of
such time, then either party may initiate litigation. All costs of the mediation and the mediator charged by JAMS shall be shared equally by the parties. Each party shall bear its own attorneys fees and other costs in connection with the mediation.
The mediation shall not preclude any party from seeking injunctive or other provisional or equitable relief in order to preserve the status quo between the parties pending resolution of the dispute, nor shall the filing of an action seeking
injunctive or other provisional relief be construed as a failure by that party to comply with the mediation requirements of this Agreement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
