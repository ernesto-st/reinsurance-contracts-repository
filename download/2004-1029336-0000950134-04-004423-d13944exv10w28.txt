                  Section 2. Commitments, Letters of Credit, Fees, Register,
Prepayments and Replacement of Lenders.

                  2.01. Loans.

                  (a) Revolving Credit Loans. Each Revolving Credit Lender
severally agrees, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to make
revolving credit loans (the "Revolving Credit Loans") to Borrower in Dollars
during the period from but not including the Closing Date to but not including
the date that is five days prior to the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination
Date in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not exceeding
the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender as in effect from
time to time; provided, however, that in no event shall (i) the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding made by
any Revolving Credit Lender, plus such Lender's pro rata share (based on the
Revolving Credit Commitments) of the aggregate principal amount of Swing Loans
then outstanding, plus such Lender's pro rata share (based on the Revolving
Credit Commitments) of the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities
exceed such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment at in effect at such time, or
(ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of (without duplication) all
Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding, plus the aggregate principal amount of
Swing Loans then outstanding, plus the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit
Liabilities at any time exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments as in effect at such time. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, during such period Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow the
amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments by means of ABR Loans and LIBOR Loans
and may Convert Revolving Credit Loans of one Type into Revolving Credit Loans
of another Type (as provided in Section 2.09) or Continue Revolving Credit Loans
of one Type as Revolving Credit Loans of the same Type (as provided in Section
2.09).

                  (b) Term Loans. Each Lender having a Term Loan Commitment
severally agrees, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to make a
single term loan (the "Term Loans") to Borrower in Dollars on the Closing Date
in an aggregate principal amount equal to its Term Loan Commitment (or if less
than $180.0 million is requested pursuant to a notice of borrowing given
pursuant to Section 4.05, its Term Loan Commitment multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of borrowing requested and the denominator of
which is $180.0 million), such loan to be used to finance a portion of the
Transactions and the Superior Acquisition and, in each case, to pay related fees
and expenses; provided that any proceeds from the Term Loans in excess of $140.0
million shall be placed into the Escrow Account subject to release only upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.03. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, on and after the Closing Date, Borrower may
Convert Term Loans of one Type into Term Loans of another Type (as provided in
Section 2.09) or Continue Term Loans of one Type as Term Loans of the same Type
(as provided in Section 2.09). Term Loans that are repaid or prepaid may not be
reborrowed.

                  (c) Limit on LIBOR Loans. No more than 10 separate Interest
Periods in respect of LIBOR Loans of each Class may be outstanding at any one
time. Unless consented to by the Lead Arrangers in their reasonable discretion,
no LIBOR Loans (other than one month LIBOR Loans) may be made prior to the
completion of the Primary Syndication.

                  (d) Swing Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, upon request of Borrower, the Swing Loan Lender agrees to make one or
more swing loans to Borrower from time to time from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the date that is five days prior to the Swing Loan
Maturity Date, up to but not exceeding the amount of the Swing Loan Lender's
Swing Loan Commitment as then in effect. (Such swing loans referred to in this
Section 2.01(d) now or hereafter made by the Swing Loan Lender to Borrower from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the Swing Loan Maturity Date are
hereinafter collectively called the "Swing Loans.") Prior to the Swing


                                      -34-
<PAGE>


Loan Maturity Date, Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Swing Loans up to
the Swing Loan Commitment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
Swing Loan Lender shall not make any Swing Loans on or after the Swing Loan
Maturity Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 2.01(d) or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Swing Loan Lender shall not
be obligated, pursuant to this Section 2.01(d) or otherwise, to make any Swing
Loan to or for the account of Borrower, and Borrower shall not be entitled to
borrow, pursuant to this Section 2.01(d), if, after giving full effect to the
requested Swing Loan, the aggregate outstanding amount of Revolving Credit
Loans, plus the aggregate outstanding amount of Swing Loans, plus the aggregate
outstanding Letter of Credit Liabilities would exceed the aggregate amount of
the Revolving Credit Commitments as in effect at such time. Notwithstanding
anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary, the Swing Loans will be made and
maintained only as ABR Loans. The Swing Loan Lender shall not make any Swing
Loan after receiving a written notice from Borrower or the Majority Revolving
Credit Lenders stating that a Default exists and is continuing until such time
as the Swing Loan Lender shall have received written notice of (i) rescission of
all such notices from the party or parties originally delivering such notice,
(ii) the waiver of such Default by the Majority Lenders, or (iii) the
Administrative Agent's good faith determination that such Default has ceased to
exist. Swing Loans shall be made in minimum amounts of $100,000 and integral
multiples of $50,000 above such amount.

                  Upon the occurrence of a Default, each Revolving Credit Lender
shall be deemed to have purchased (and each Revolving Credit Lender hereby
irrevocably agrees to purchase on a pro rata basis (based upon each Revolving
Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment)) an irrevocable participation in
all outstanding Swing Loans, together with all accrued interest thereon, without
any further action by or on behalf of the Swing Loan Lender, any other Lender,
Borrower or any other Person. Upon one Business Day's notice from the Swing Loan
Lender, each other Revolving Credit Lender shall deliver to the Swing Loan
Lender an amount equal to its respective participation in such Swing Loan (as
determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) in cash. In order to
evidence such participation, each Revolving Credit Lender agrees to enter into a
participation agreement at the request of the Swing Loan Lender in form and
substance satisfactory to the Swing Loan Lender and the Revolving Credit Lender.
If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Swing Loan Lender
the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender's participation as provided in this
paragraph, the Swing Loan Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on
demand from such Revolving Credit Lender, together with interest thereon at the
Federal Funds Rate until such amount is paid in full in cash. In the event the
Swing Loan Lender receives a payment from Borrower or any other Obligor of any
amount in which the Revolving Credit Lenders have purchased participations as
provided in this paragraph, the Swing Loan Lender shall promptly distribute to
each Revolving Credit Lender its pro rata share of such payment. In the event
that any portion of any Swing Loan is not repaid when due, the Swing Loan Lender
shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent
shall promptly, and in no event later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, two
Business Days after its receipt of such notice, notify each Revolving Credit
Lender in writing of the unreimbursed amount of such Swing Loan and of such
Revolving Credit Lender's percentage of such unreimbursed amount (to be pro rata
based upon the Revolving Credit Commitments). Each of the Revolving Credit
Lenders shall make a Revolving Credit Loan in an amount equal to such percentage
of the unreimbursed amount of such Swing Loan, together with accrued unpaid
interest thereon (to the extent that there is availability under the Revolving
Credit Commitments), and pay the proceeds thereof, in immediately available
funds, directly to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Loan
Lender, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, on the next Business Day after
the date such Revolving Credit Lender is notified by the Administrative Agent.
Revolving Credit Loans made by the Lenders to repay unreimbursed Swing Loans
pursuant to this subsection shall constitute Revolving Credit Loans hereunder,
initially shall be ABR Loans and shall be subject to all of the provisions of
this Agreement concerning Revolving Credit Loans, except that such Revolving
Credit Loans shall be made upon demand by the Administrative Agent as set forth
above rather than upon notice by Borrower, and shall be made, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, without regard to satisfaction


                                      -35-
<PAGE>


of conditions precedent to the making of Revolving Credit Loans set forth in
Section 7.02 of this Agreement; provided, however that no Lender shall be
obligated to make such Revolving Credit Loans if, prior to the date of the
borrowing of the Swing Loan to be refunded, the Swing Loan Lender had received
written notice from the Administrative Agent or any Lender of the existence and
continuance of a Default or an Event of Default. Anything contained in this
Agreement or otherwise to the contrary notwithstanding, (A) each Revolving
Credit Lender's obligation to comply with this paragraph shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without
limitation, (1) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Revolving Credit Lender may now or hereafter have against the Swing
Loan Lender, Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (2) the
occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default (except as set
forth in this paragraph), (3) any Material Adverse Change in the condition of
any Company, (4) any breach or default of this Agreement or any of the Security
Documents by any Person, or (5) any other circumstance, happening or event
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, and (B) the Swing
Loan Lender shall not have any obligation to make any Swing Loans if (1)
Borrower fails for whatever reason to satisfy any of the conditions precedent
set forth in Section 7.02 or (2) any Revolving Credit Lender fails for whatever
reason to comply with its obligations under this Section 2.01(d).

                  2.02. Borrowings. Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent
notice of each borrowing hereunder as provided in Section 4.05. The form of such
notice of borrowing shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit I. Promptly
following receipt of a notice of borrowing in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan or Loans to be made by it as part of the requested
borrowing. Not later than 1 p.m. New York time on the date specified for each
borrowing hereunder, each Lender shall make available the amount of the Loan or
Loans to be made by it on such date to the Administrative Agent, at an account
specified by the Administrative Agent maintained at the Principal Office, in
immediately available funds, for the account of Borrower. Each borrowing of
Revolving Credit Loans shall be made by each Revolving Credit Lender pro rata
based on such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage. The amounts so
received by the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, be made available to Borrower by depositing the same, in
immediately available funds, in an account designated by Borrower.

                  2.03. Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Revolving Credit Commitments may be utilized, upon the request of
Borrower, in addition to the Revolving Credit Loans provided for by Section
2.01(a), for standby and documentary letters of credit (herein collectively
called "Letters of Credit") issued by the Issuing Lender for the account of
Borrower or any Subsidiary which is an Obligor (provided, that Borrower shall be
a co-applicant (and jointly and severally liable) with respect to each Letter of
Credit issued for the account of any such Subsidiary); provided, however, that
in no event shall (i) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities,
plus the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans then
outstanding, plus the aggregate principal amount of Swing Loans then outstanding
exceed at any time the Revolving Credit Commitments as in effect at such time,
(ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans then
outstanding made by any Revolving Credit Lender, plus such Lender's pro rata
share (based on the Revolving Credit Commitments) of the aggregate principal
amount of Swing Loans then outstanding, plus such Lender's pro rata share (based
on the Revolving Credit Commitments) of the aggregate amount of all Letter of
Credit Liabilities exceed such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment as in effect
at such time, (iii) the outstanding aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit
Liabilities exceed $20.0 million, (iv) the face amount of any Letter of Credit
be less than $10,000, (v) the expiration date of any Letter of Credit extend
beyond the earlier of (x) the fifth Business Day preceding the Revolving Credit
Commitment Termination Date and (y) the date twelve months following the date of
such issuance for standby Letters of Credit or 180 days after the date of such
issuance (or as otherwise agreed with the Issuing Lender) for documentary
Letters of Credit, unless the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders have approved
such expiry date in writing


                                      -36-
<PAGE>
(but never beyond the fifth Business Day prior to the Revolving Credit
Commitment Termination Date); provided, however, that any standby Letter of
Credit may be automatically extendible for periods of up to one year (but never
beyond the fifth Business Day preceding the Revolving Credit Commitment
Termination Date) so long as such Letter of Credit provides that the Issuing
Lender retains an option satisfactory to the Issuing Lender to terminate such
Letter of Credit prior to each extension date, unless the Majority Revolving
Credit Lenders have approved such expiry date in writing, or (vi) the Issuing
Lender issue any Letter of Credit after it has received notice from Borrower or
the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders stating that a Default exists until such
time as the Issuing Lender shall have received written notice of (x) rescission
of such notice from the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders, (y) waiver of such
Default in accordance with this Agreement or (z) the Administrative Agent's good
faith determination that such Default has ceased to exist. The following
additional provisions shall apply to Letters of Credit:

                  (a) Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at least
         three Business Days' irrevocable prior notice (effective upon receipt)
         specifying the date (which shall be no later than thirty days preceding
         the Revolving Credit Termination Date) each Letter of Credit is to be
         issued and describing in reasonable detail the proposed terms of such
         Letter of Credit (including the beneficiary thereof) (including whether
         such Letter of Credit is to be a documentary Letter of Credit or a
         standby Letter of Credit). Upon receipt of any such notice, the
         Administrative Agent shall advise the Issuing Lender of the contents
         thereof. Each Lender hereby authorizes, on the terms and conditions of
         this Agreement, the Issuing Lender to issue, and perform its
         obligations under, Letters of Credit. Letters of Credit shall be issued
         in accordance with the customary procedures of the Issuing Lender,
         which may include an application for Letters of Credit. The Issuing
         Lender may refuse to issue any Letter of Credit the contents of which
         are not reasonably satisfactory to it provided that it notifies
         Borrower of the reasons for its refusal. If there is any conflict
         between the procedures required by the Issuing Lender and this
         Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.

                  (b) On each day during the period commencing with the issuance
         by the Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit and until such Letter of
         Credit shall have expired or been terminated, the Revolving Credit
         Commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to be
         utilized for all purposes hereof in an amount equal to such Lender's
         Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the then undrawn face amount
         of such Letter of Credit. Each Revolving Credit Lender (other than the
         Issuing Lender) agrees that, upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit
         hereunder, it shall automatically acquire a participation in the
         Issuing Lender's liability under such Letter of Credit in an amount
         equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such
         liability, and each Revolving Credit Lender (other than the Issuing
         Lender) thereby shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
         assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and shall be
         unconditionally obligated to the Issuing Lender to pay and discharge
         when due, its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the Issuing
         Lender's liability under such Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender
         shall be deemed to hold a Letter of Credit Liability in an amount equal
         to its retained interest in the related Letter of Credit after giving
         effect to such acquisition by the Revolving Credit Lenders other than
         the Issuing Lender of their participation interests.

                  (c) Upon the making of any payment to the beneficiary of any
         Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify Borrower
         (through the Administrative Agent) of the amount paid by the Issuing
         Lender and the date on which payment was made to such beneficiary.
         Borrower hereby unconditionally agrees to pay and reimburse the Issuing
         Lender for the amount of payment under such Letter of Credit, together
         with interest thereon at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable
         Margin applicable to Revolving Credit Loans from the date payment was



                                      -37-
<PAGE>


         made to such beneficiary to the date on which payment is due, not later
         than the next Business Day after the date on which Borrower receives
         such notice from the Issuing Lender. Any such payment due from Borrower
         and not paid on the required date shall bear interest at rates
         specified in Section 3.02(b).

                  (d) Forthwith upon its receipt of a notice referred to in
         clause (c) of this Section 2.03, Borrower shall advise the Issuing
         Lender whether or not Borrower intends to borrow hereunder to finance
         its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount of the
         related demand for payment and, if it does, submit a notice of such
         borrowing as provided in Section 4.05. In the event that Borrower fails
         to so advise the Administrative Agent, or if Borrower fails to
         reimburse the Issuing Lender for a demand for payment under a Letter of
         Credit by the next Business Day after the date of such notice, the
         Administrative Agent shall give each Revolving Credit Lender prompt
         notice of the amount of the demand for payment, specifying such
         Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the amount of the
         related demand for payment.

                  (e) Each Revolving Credit Lender (other than the Issuing
         Lender) shall pay to the Administrative Agent for account of the
         Issuing Lender at the Principal Office in Dollars and in immediately
         available funds, the amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit
         Commitment Percentage of any payment under a Letter of Credit upon not
         less than one Business Day's notice by the Issuing Lender (through the
         Administrative Agent) to such Revolving Credit Lender requesting such
         payment and specifying such amount. Each such Revolving Credit Lender's
         obligation to make such payments to the Administrative Agent for
         account of the Issuing Lender under this clause (e), and the Issuing
         Lender's right to receive the same, shall be absolute and unconditional
         and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including (i)
         the failure of any other Revolving Credit Lender to make its payment
         under this clause (e), (ii) the financial condition of Borrower or the
         existence of any Default or Event of Default or (iii) the termination
         of the Commitments. Each such payment to the Issuing Lender shall be
         made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction
         whatsoever.

                  (f) Upon the making of each payment by a Revolving Credit
         Lender to the Issuing Lender pursuant to clause (e) above in respect of
         any Letter of Credit, such Lender shall, automatically and without any
         further action on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
         Lender or such Lender, acquire (i) a participation in an amount equal
         to such payment in the Reimbursement Obligation owing to the Issuing
         Lender by Borrower hereunder and under the Letter of Credit Documents
         relating to such Letter of Credit and (ii) a participation in a
         percentage equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment
         Percentage in any interest or other amounts payable by Borrower
         hereunder and under such Letter of Credit Documents in respect of such
         Reimbursement Obligation. Upon receipt by the Issuing Lender from or
         for the account of Borrower of any payment in respect of any
         Reimbursement Obligation or any such interest or other amounts
         (including by way of setoff or application of proceeds of any
         collateral security) the Issuing Lender shall promptly pay to the
         Administrative Agent for account of each Revolving Credit Lender which
         has satisfied its obligations under clause (e) above (and the
         Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each such Revolving Credit
         Lender), such Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment
         Percentage of such payment, each such payment by the Issuing Lender to
         be made in the same money and funds in which received by the Issuing
         Lender. In the event any payment received by the Issuing Lender and so
         paid to the Revolving Credit Lenders hereunder is rescinded or must
         otherwise be returned by the Issuing Lender, each Revolving Credit
         Lender shall, upon the request of the Issuing Lender (through the
         Administrative Agent), repay to the Issuing Lender (through the
         Administrative Agent) the amount of such payment paid to such Lender,
         with interest at the rate specified in clause (i) of this Section 2.03.


                                      -38-

                  (g) Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
         account of the Issuing Lender in respect of each Letter of Credit a
         letter of credit commission in an amount (not less than $250) equal to
         (x) the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for Revolving
         Credit Loans that are LIBOR Loans in effect from time to time,
         multiplied by (y) the daily average undrawn face amount of such Letter
         of Credit for the period from and including the date of issuance of
         such Letter of Credit (i) in the case of a Letter of Credit which
         expires in accordance with its terms, to and including such expiration
         date and (ii) in the case of a Letter of Credit which is drawn in full
         or is otherwise terminated other than on the stated expiration date of
         such Letter of Credit, to but excluding the date such Letter of Credit
         is drawn in full or is terminated, such fee to be non-refundable and to
         be paid in arrears quarterly, on each Quarterly Date (or such $250 per
         annum fee to be paid on the date of issuance of the applicable Letter
         of Credit), and on the earlier of the Revolving Credit Commitment
         Termination Date or the date of the termination of the Revolving Credit
         Commitments or the date of such termination, expiration or the Business
         Day subsequent to notice of a drawing. The Issuing Lender shall pay to
         the Administrative Agent for account of each Revolving Credit Lender
         (other than the Issuing Lender), from time to time at reasonable
         intervals (but in any event at least quarterly), but only to the extent
         actually received from Borrower (and the Administrative Agent shall
         promptly pay to each such Revolving Credit Lender), an amount equal to
         such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of all letter of
         credit commissions referred to in the first sentence of this clause
         (g). In addition, Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
         account of the Issuing Lender only in respect of each Letter of Credit
         a letter of credit issuance fee in an amount equal to, in the case of
         standby Letters of Credit, 0.25% per annum multiplied by the original
         face amount, and, in the case of documentary Letters of Credit, 0.25%
         per annum multiplied by the average daily outstanding amount, in each
         case from the issue date through the expiry date of such Letter of
         Credit (but in no event less than $500 per Letter of Credit), and such
         other fees as may be agreed by Borrower and the Issuing Lender, such
         amount to be payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Date, plus
         all charges, costs and expenses in the amounts customarily charged by
         the Issuing Lender from time to time in like circumstances with respect
         to the issuance, amendment or transfer of each Letter of Credit and
         drawings and other transactions relating thereto.

                  (h) Upon the request of any Revolving Credit Lender from time
         to time, the Issuing Lender shall deliver any other information
         reasonably requested by such Lender with respect to each Letter of
         Credit then outstanding.

                  (i) To the extent that any Revolving Credit Lender fails to
         pay an amount required to be paid pursuant to clause (e) or (f) of this
         Section 2.03 on the due date therefor, such Lender shall pay interest
         to the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent) on such amount
         from and including such due date to but excluding the date such payment
         is made (i) during the period from and including such due date to but
         excluding the date three Business Days thereafter, at a rate per annum
         equal to the Federal Funds Rate (as in effect from time to time) and
         (ii) thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the post-default rate (as
         in effect from time to time) pursuant to Section 3.02(b)(y).

                  (j) The issuance by the Issuing Lender of any modification or
         supplement to any Letter of Credit hereunder that would extend the
         expiry date or increase the face amount thereof shall be subject to the
         same conditions applicable under this Section 2.03 to the issuance of
         new Letters of Credit, and no such modification or supplement shall be
         issued hereunder unless either (x) the respective Letter of Credit
         affected thereby would have complied with such conditions had it
         originally been issued hereunder in such modified or supplemented form
         or (y) each Revolving Credit Lender shall have consented thereto.


                                      -39-
<PAGE>


                  (k) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing Lender shall
         not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if at the
         time of such issuance, any order, judgment or decree of any
         Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to
         enjoin or restrain the Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of
         Credit or any requirement of law applicable to the Issuing Lender or
         any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from
         any Governmental Authority shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing
         Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or
         such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing
         Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve
         or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Lender is not otherwise
         compensated) not in effect on the date hereof. At any time that the
         Issuing Lender shall not be under any obligation to issue Letters of
         Credit pursuant to this paragraph (k), the Issuing Lender may be
         replaced by Borrower with another Lender reasonably acceptable to the
         Administrative Agent upon notice to the Issuing Lender and the
         Administrative Agent. Upon any such replacement, the Administrative
         Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing
         Lender and the replacement Issuing Lender shall agree to be bound by
         the applicable provisions of this Agreement. At the time any such
         replacement shall become effective, Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees
         accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Lender pursuant to
         Section 2.03(g). From and after the effective date of any such
         replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Lender shall have all the rights
         and obligations of the Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect
         to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein
         to the term "Issuing Lender" shall be deemed to refer to such successor
         or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to such successor and all
         previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require. After the
         replacement of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the replaced Issuing Lender
         shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights
         and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect
         to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall
         not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

                  Each Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a Letter
of Credit issued hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents. The obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and any
Letter of Credit Document to reimburse the Issuing Lender for a drawing under a
Letter of Credit, and to repay any drawing under a Letter of Credit converted
into Revolving Credit Loans, shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall
be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each such
other Letter of Credit Document under all circumstances, including the
following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
Letter of Credit Document; (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or
other right that Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any
transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary
or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Lender or any other Person,
whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby
or by the Letter of Credit Documents or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any
draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under any Letter of
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect
or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss
or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to
make a drawing under any Letter of Credit; or any defense based upon the failure
of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to conform to the terms of the Letter of
Credit or any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the
proceeds of such drawing; or (iv) any other circumstance or happening
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other
circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a
discharge of, Borrower or a Guarantor; provided, however, that Borrower shall
not be obligated to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any wrongful payment
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made by the Issuing
Lender as a result of acts or omissions constituting bad faith or gross
negligence on the part of the Issuing Lender. To the extent that any provision
of any Letter of Credit Document is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section 2.03, the provisions of this Section 2.03 shall control.

                  2.04. Termination and Reductions of Commitments. (a) The
aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be automatically and
permanently reduced to zero on the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date.
The aggregate amount of Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permanently
reduced on the date any required prepayments described in Section 2.10(a) are
required to be made in the amount specified in Section 2.10(b)(ii).

                  The aggregate amount of the Term Loan Commitments shall be
automatically and permanently reduced to zero immediately after the making of
the Term Loans on the Closing Date.

                  (a) Borrower shall have the right at any time or from time to
time (without premium or penalty except breakage costs (if any)) (i) so long as
no Revolving Credit Loans or Letter of Credit Liabilities will be outstanding as
of the date specified for termination, to terminate the Revolving Credit
Commitments, and (ii) to reduce the aggregate amount of the Unutilized Revolving
Credit Commitments of all the Revolving Credit Lenders; provided, however, that
(x) Borrower shall give notice of each such termination or reduction as provided
in Section 4.05, and (y) each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount
at least equal to $5.0 million (or a larger multiple of $1.0 million) or, if
less, the remaining Revolving Credit Commitments.

                  (b) The Commitments once terminated or reduced may not be
reinstated.

                  2.05. Fees. (a) Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender (and the Administrative Agent
shall promptly pay to each such Revolving Credit Lender) a commitment fee on the
daily average amount of such Lender's Unutilized Revolving Credit Commitment,
for the period from and including the Closing Date to but not including the
earlier of the date such Revolving Credit Commitment is terminated and the
Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date, at a rate per annum equal to
0.500%; provided that at any time when the Total Leverage Ratio set forth in the
Interest Rate Certificate most recently delivered by Borrower to the
Administrative Agent is less than 2.75:1 such rate per annum shall be 0.375%.
Any accrued commitment fee under this Section 2.05(a) shall be payable in
arrears on each Quarterly Date and on the Revolving Credit Commitment
Termination Date.

                  (a) Borrower agrees to pay to the Lead Arrangers and the
Administrative Agent, for their own account, the fees in the amounts and on the
dates set forth in the Fee Letter and the Incremental Fee Letter.

                  2.06. Lending Offices. The Loans of each Type made by each
Lender shall be made and maintained at such Lender's Applicable Lending Office
for Loans of such Type. No Lender shall (unless required by law or if the
failure to do so would adversely affect such Lender) change its Applicable
Lending Office for LIBOR Loans if such change would increase Borrower's net
costs or expenses hereunder materially (including withholding payments).

                  2.07. Several Obligations of Lenders. The failure of any
Lender to make any Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall
not relieve any other Lender of its obligation to make its Loan on such date,
but neither any Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make a Loan to be made by such other Lender, and
no Lender shall have any obligation to the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender for the failure by such Lender to make any Loan required to be made by
such Lender.

                  2.08. Notes; Register. (a) (i) Each Revolving Credit Lender
may request Notes to be issued in connection with its Revolving Credit
Commitments by written notice to the Administrative Agent. The Revolving Credit
Loans made or to be made by any Revolving Credit Lender who has


                                      -41-
<PAGE>


requested a Note shall be evidenced by one or more promissory notes of Borrower,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1, payable to such Lender and otherwise
duly completed.

                  (i) At the request of each Lender having Term Loan Commitments
by written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Term Loans made by such
Lender shall be evidenced by one or more promissory notes of Borrower,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2, payable to such Lender and otherwise
duly completed.

                  (ii) At the request of the Swing Loan Lender by written notice
to the Administrative Agent, the Swing Loans made by the Swing Loan Lender shall
be evidenced by one or more promissory notes of Borrower, substantially in the
form of Exhibit A-3, payable to the Swing Loan Lender and otherwise duly
completed.

                  (b) The date, amount, Type, interest rate and duration of
Interest Period (if applicable) of each Loan of each Class made by each Lender
to Borrower, and each payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be
recorded by such Lender on its books and, prior to any transfer of any Note
evidencing the Loans of such Class held by it, endorsed by such Lender on the
schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided, however,
that the failure of such Lender to make any such recordation or endorsement or
any error in making any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the
obligations of Borrower to make a payment when due of any amount owing hereunder
or under such Note.

                  (c) Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to
serve as its agent, solely for purposes of this Section 2.08, to maintain a
register (the "Register") on which it will record the name and address of each
Lender, the Commitment from time to time of each of the Lenders, the principal
amount of the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of
the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. Failure to make any such
recordation or any error in such recordation shall not affect Borrower's
obligations in respect of such Loans. The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register as the owner of a Loan or other obligation hereunder as the owner
thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents,
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by Borrower and (solely with respect to its Commitments and Loans)
any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

                  2.09. Optional Prepayments and Conversions or Continuations of
Loans. Subject to Section 4.04, Borrower shall have the right to prepay Loans,
in whole or in part, without penalty or premium, or to Convert Loans of one Type
into Loans of another Type or to Continue Loans of one Type as Loans of the same
Type, at any time or from time to time to be applied as specified by Borrower;
provided, however, that: (a) Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice
of each such prepayment, Conversion or Continuation as provided in Section 4.05
(and, upon the date specified in any such notice of prepayment, the amount to be
prepaid shall become due and payable hereunder); (b) if LIBOR Loans are prepaid
or Converted other than on the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans,
Borrower shall at such time pay all expenses and costs required by Section 5.05;
and (c) prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be
applied to scheduled Amortization Payments on a pro rata basis. Each notice of
Conversion or Continuation shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit J.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting the rights
and remedies of the Lenders under Section 10, in the event that any Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may (and
at the request of the Majority Lenders shall) suspend the right of Borrower to
Convert any Loan into a LIBOR Loan, or to Continue any Loan as a LIBOR Loan, in
which


                                      -42-
<PAGE>


event all Loans shall be Converted (on the last day(s) of the respective
Interest Periods therefor) or Continued, as the case may be, as ABR Loans.

                  2.10. Mandatory Prepayments. (a) Borrower shall prepay the
Term Loans (subject to Section 5.05, without penalty or premium) (and/or
permanently reduce Revolving Credit Commitments) as follows (each such
prepayment and reduction to be effected in each case in the manner, order and to
the extent specified in subsection (b) below of this Section 2.10):

                  (i) Casualty Events. On or prior to the third Business Day
         after the date on which any Company receives any Net Available Proceeds
         from any Casualty Event, in an aggregate principal amount equal to 100%
         of such Net Available Proceeds; provided, however, that (x) so long as
         no Event of Default then exists or would arise therefrom, such Net
         Available Proceeds shall not be required to be so applied on such date
         to the extent that Borrower has delivered an Officer's Certificate to
         the Administrative Agent on or prior to such date stating that such
         proceeds shall be used to (1) repair, replace or restore any Property
         in respect of which such Net Available Proceeds were paid or (2) fund
         the substitution of other Property used or usable in the business of
         Borrower and the Subsidiaries, in each case within 180 days following
         the date of the receipt of such Net Available Proceeds, (y) all such
         Net Available Proceeds shall be delivered to the Collateral Agent
         within 30 days of such receipt to be held in the Collateral Account and
         released therefrom only in accordance with Section 12, and (z) if all
         or any portion of such Net Available Proceeds not required to be
         applied to the prepayment of Term Loans (or reduction of Revolving
         Credit Commitments) pursuant to the preceding proviso is not so used
         within 180 days after the date of the receipt of such Net Available
         Proceeds, such remaining portion shall be applied on the last day of
         such period as specified in Section 2.10(b), unless prior to such 180th
         day a Company shall have entered into a binding agreement to so use
         such Net Available Proceeds, in each case within 180 days after the
         date of such agreement (and if not so used, the Net Available Proceeds
         shall be applied as specified in Section 2.10(b)).

                  (ii) Equity Issuance. On or prior to the third Business Day
         after the date on which the Person consummating the relevant Equity

         Issuance that is consummated after the Closing Date, in an aggregate
         principal amount equal to 50% of such Net Available Proceeds; provided,
         however, that the Designated Equity Issuance Proceeds to the extent
         contemporaneously applied pursuant to Section 9.06(i) need not be so
         applied.

                  (iii) Debt Issuance. On or prior to the third Business Day
         after the date on which the Person consummating the relevant Debt

         of Default then exists or would arise therefrom and (2) Borrower
         delivers an Officer's Certificate to the Administrative Agent on or
         prior to such date stating that such Net Available Proceeds shall be
         reinvested in capital assets of Borrower or any Subsidiary in each case
         within 180 days following the date of such Disposition Event (which
         certificate shall set forth the estimates of the proceeds to be so
         expended), (y) all such Net Available


                                      -43-
<PAGE>


         Proceeds shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent within 30 days
         of such receipt to be held in the Collateral Account and released
         therefrom only in accordance with Section 12, and (z) if all or any
         portion of such Net Available Proceeds not so applied as provided
         herein is not so used within such 180 day period, such remaining
         portion shall be applied on the last day of such period as specified in
         Section 2.10(b), unless prior to such 180th day a Company shall have
         entered into a binding agreement to so use such Net Available Proceeds,
         in each case within 180 days after the date of such agreement (and if
         not so used, the Net Available Proceeds shall be applied as specified
         in Section 2.10(b)). Any interest income from Net Available Proceeds
         held in the Collateral Account shall be for the account of Borrower
         and, so long as no Default then exists and subject to Section 12, shall
         be delivered to Borrower (after deduction of customary administrative
         fees and expenses, if any) from time to time upon request by Borrower.

                  (v) Excess Cash Flow. Not later than 100 days after the end of
         each fiscal year of Borrower commencing with the fiscal year ending
         December 31, 2004, in an aggregate principal amount equal to (A) the
         excess of (x) 75% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year less (y) an
         amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of Term Loans pursuant to
         Section 2.09 made from internally generated funds during such fiscal
         year if such fiscal year ends on or prior to December 31, 2005 or, if
         such fiscal year ends after December 31, 2005, the Total Leverage Ratio
         at the end of such fiscal year is greater than or equal to 3.0:1.0 (as
         evidenced in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Administrative
         Agent), or (B) the excess of (x) 50% of Excess Cash Flow for such
         fiscal year less (y) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of
         Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.09 made from internally generated
         funds during such fiscal year if such fiscal year ends after December
         31, 2005 and the Total Leverage Ratio at the end of such fiscal year is
         less than 3.0:1.0 (as evidenced in an Officer's Certificate delivered
         to the Administrative Agent).

                  (vi) Other Required Prepayments. If the terms of any
         agreement, instrument or indenture pursuant to which any Indebtedness
         pari passu with or junior in right of payment to the Loans is
         outstanding (or pursuant to which such Indebtedness is guaranteed)
         require prepayment of such Indebtedness out of the proceeds of any
         Disposition or otherwise unless such proceeds are used to prepay other
         Indebtedness, then, to the extent not otherwise required by this
         Section 2.10(a), the Loans shall be repaid in an amount not less than
         the minimum amount that would be required to be prepaid not later than
         the latest time as and upon such terms so that such other Indebtedness
         will not be required to be prepaid pursuant to the terms of the
         agreement, indenture or instrument or guarantee governing such other
         Indebtedness.

                  (vii) No Superior Acquisition. If the Superior Acquisition has
         not been consummated and the Escrowed Funds have not been released from
         the Escrow Account within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Escrow
         Agent shall apply the Escrowed Funds to repay the Term Loans on the
         61st day after the Closing Date without any action by Borrower.

                  (b) Application. The amount of any required prepayments
described in Section 2.10(a) shall be applied as follows:

                  (i) first, the amount of the required prepayment shall be
         applied to the reduction of Amortization Payments on the Term Loans
         required by Section 3.01(b) pro rata to the remaining Amortization
         Payments thereof; and

                  (ii) second, after such time as no Term Loans remain
         outstanding, Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permanently reduced
         (at the same time that the prepayment of the Term Loans would have been
         made and assuming an unlimited amount thereof then outstanding) pro


                                      -44-
<PAGE>


         rata in an amount equal to the remaining amount of any such required
         prepayment that would have been applied to the Term Loans (assuming an
         unlimited amount thereof then outstanding) and to the extent that,
         after giving effect to such reduction, the aggregate principal amount
         of Revolving Credit Loans, plus the aggregate principal amount of Swing
         Loans, plus the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities
         would exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments, Borrower shall, first,
         prepay outstanding Swing Loans, second, prepay outstanding Revolving
         Credit Loans and, third, provide cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities
         in the manner provided by Section 2.10(d), in an aggregate amount equal
         to such excess.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of any prepayment
of Loans required under this Section 2.10 shall be in excess of the amount of
the ABR Loans at the time outstanding, only the portion of the amount of such
prepayment as is equal to the amount of such outstanding ABR Loans shall be
immediately prepaid and, at the election of Borrower, the balance of such
required prepayment shall be either (i) deposited in the Collateral Account and
applied to the prepayment of LIBOR Loans on the last day of the then
next-expiring Interest Period for LIBOR Loans or (ii) prepaid immediately,
together with any amounts owing to the Lenders under Section 5.05.
Notwithstanding any such deposit in the Collateral Account, interest shall
continue to accrue on such Loans until prepayment.

                  (c) Revolving Credit Extension Reductions. Until the Revolving
Credit Commitment Termination Date, Borrower shall from time to time immediately
prepay the Swing Loans and the Revolving Credit Loans (and/or provide cover for
Letter of Credit Liabilities as specified in Section 2.10(d)) in such amounts as
shall be necessary so that at all times the aggregate outstanding amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans, plus the aggregate outstanding amount of Swing Loans,
plus the aggregate outstanding Letter of Credit Liabilities shall not exceed the
Revolving Credit Commitments as in effect at such time, such amount to be
applied, first, to Swing Loans, second, to Revolving Credit Loans outstanding
and, third, as cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities outstanding as specified
in Section 2.10(d).

                  (d) Cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities. In the event that
Borrower shall be required pursuant to this Section 2.10 to provide cover for
Letter of Credit Liabilities, Borrower shall effect the same by paying to the
Collateral Agent immediately available funds in an amount equal to the required
amount, which funds shall be retained by the Collateral Agent in the LC
Sub-Account until such time as all Letters of Credit shall have been terminated
and all of the Letter of Credit Liabilities paid in full.

                  2.11. Replacement of Lenders. Borrower shall have the right,
if no Default then exists, to replace any Lender (the "Replaced Lender") with
one or more other Eligible Persons reasonably acceptable to the Lead Arrangers
(collectively, the "Replacement Lender") if (x) such Lender is charging Borrower
increased costs pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.06 in excess of those being
charged generally by the other Lenders or such Lender becomes incapable of
making LIBOR Loans as provided in Section 5.03 and/or (y) as provided in Section
13.04(ii), such Lender refuses to consent to certain proposed amendments,
waivers or modifications with respect to this Agreement; provided, however, that
(i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section 2.11, the
Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more assignment agreements in
accordance with Section 13.06(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to Section
13.06 to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement
Lender shall acquire all of the Commitments and outstanding Loans of, and in
each case Letter of Credit Interests for, the Replaced Lender and, in connection
therewith, shall pay to (x) the Replaced Lender, an amount equal to the sum of
(A) the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the
Replaced Lender, (B) all Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Replaced
Lender, together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such
time, and (C) all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced
Lender pursuant to Section 2.05, and (y) the Issuing Lender an amount equal to
such Replaced Lender's

                                      -45-
<PAGE>


Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any Reimbursement Obligations (which
at such time remains a Reimbursement Obligation) to the extent such amount was
not theretofore funded by such Replaced Lender, and (ii) all obligations of
Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically described
in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been,
or is concurrently being, paid, but including any amounts which would be paid to
a Lender pursuant to Section 5.05 if Borrower were prepaying a LIBOR Loan) shall
be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon
the execution of the applicable assignment agreement, the payment of amounts
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so requested by the
Replacement Lender, delivery to the Replacement Lender of Notes executed by
Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the
Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder and be released of
all its obligations as a Lender, except with respect to indemnification
provisions applicable to the Replaced Lender under this Agreement, which shall
survive as to such Replaced Lender.

                  Section 3. Payments of Principal and Interest.

                  3.01. Repayment of Loans.

                  (a) Revolving Credit and Swing Loans. Borrower hereby promises
to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the entire
outstanding principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans, and each
Revolving Credit Loan shall mature, on the Revolving Credit Commitment

account the entire outstanding principal amount of the Swing Loans, and the
Swing Loans shall mature, on the Swing Loan Maturity Date.

                  (b) Term Loans. Borrower hereby promises to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Term Loan Lenders, in repayment of

prepayments required by Section 2.10 to the extent actually made).

                  3.02. Interest. (a) Borrower hereby promises to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Loan (including Loans the proceeds of which are placed
in the Escrow Account) made by such Lender for the period from and including the
date of such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full at
the following rates per annum:

                  (i) during such periods as such Loan is an ABR Loan, the
         Alternate Base Rate (as in effect from time to time), plus the
         Applicable Margin; and

                  (ii) during such periods as such Loan is a LIBOR Loan, for
         each Interest Period relating thereto, the LIBOR Rate for such Loan for
         such Interest Period, plus the Applicable Margin.

                  (b) Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law,
overdue interest in respect of each Loan and other overdue amounts owed by any
Obligor under the Credit Documents (including such interest accruing before and
after judgment) shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case
of principal of any Loans, the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate then borne
by such Loans and (y) in the case of interest and such other amounts, the rate
which is 2% in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to ABR Loans which are
Revolving Credit Loans from time to time. Interest which accrues under this
paragraph shall be payable on demand.


                                      -46-
<PAGE>


                  (c) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable (i) in the
case of an ABR Loan, quarterly on the Quarterly Dates, (ii) in the case of a
LIBOR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period therefor and, if such
Interest Period is longer than three months, at three-month intervals following
the first day of such Interest Period and (iii) in the case of any LIBOR Loan,
upon the payment or prepayment thereof or the Conversion of such Loan to a Loan
of another Type (but only on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or
Converted), except that interest payable at the rate set forth in Section
3.02(b) shall be payable from time to time on demand. Promptly after the
determination of any interest rate provided for herein or any change therein,
the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders to which such
interest is payable and to Borrower.

                  Section 4. Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Computations; Etc.

                  4.01. Payments. (a) Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein, all payments of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations and other
amounts to be made by Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes, and, except

Obligors under any other Credit Document, shall be made in Dollars, in
immediately available funds, without deduction, setoff or counterclaim, to the
Administrative Agent at its account at the Principal Office, not later than 1

the next succeeding Business Day).

                  (a) Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under
this Agreement or any Note for the account of any Lender, specify (in accordance
with Section 2.09 and 2.10, if applicable) to the Administrative Agent (which
shall so notify the intended recipient(s) thereof) the Loans, Reimbursement
Obligations or other amounts payable by Borrower hereunder to which such payment
is to be applied (and in the event that Borrower fails to so specify, or if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may
distribute such payment to the Lenders for application to the Obligations under
the Credit Documents in such manner as it or the Majority Lenders, subject to
Section 4.02, may determine to be appropriate).

                  (b) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the second
sentence of Section 2.03(g), each payment received by the Administrative Agent
or by the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent) under this Agreement
or any Note for the account of any Lender shall be paid by the Administrative
Agent or by the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent), as the case
may be, to such Lender, in immediately available funds, (x) if the payment was
actually received by the Administrative Agent or by the Issuing Lender (through
the Administrative Agent), as the case may be, prior to 1 p.m. (New York time)
on any day, on such day and (y) if the payment was actually received by the
Administrative Agent or by the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative
Agent), as the case may be, after 1 p.m. (New York time) on any day, by 2:00
p.m. (New York time) on the following Business Day (it being understood that to
the extent that any such payment is not made in full by the Administrative Agent
or by the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent), as the case may be,
the Administrative Agent shall pay to such Lender, upon demand, interest at the
Federal Funds Rate from the date such amount was required to be paid to such
Lender pursuant to the foregoing clauses until the date the Administrative Agent
pays such Lender the amount).

                  (c) If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any
Note would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, such date shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall be payable
for any principal so extended for the period of such extension.

                  4.02. Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise
provided herein: (a) each borrowing of Loans of a particular Class from the
Lenders under Section 2.01 shall be made from the


                                      -47-
<PAGE>


relevant Lenders, each payment of commitment fee under Section 2.05 in respect
of Commitments of a particular Class shall be made for account of the relevant
Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a
particular Class under Section 2.04 shall be applied to the respective
Commitments of such Class of the relevant Lenders, pro rata according to the
amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; provided, however, that
Swing Loans shall be made only by, and interest thereon shall be paid by
Borrower only to, the Swing Loan Lender (subject to such Lender's obligations in
respect of any participation therein purchased by the other Revolving Credit
Lenders as provided in Section 2.01(d)); (b) except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.04, LIBOR Loans of any Class having the same Interest Period shall be
allocated pro rata among the relevant Lenders according to the amounts of their
respective Revolving Credit and Term Loan Commitments (in the case of the making
of Loans) or their respective Revolving Credit and Term Loans (in the case of
Conversions and Continuations of Loans); (c) each payment or prepayment of
principal of Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans by Borrower shall be made for
account of the relevant Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective
unpaid outstanding principal amounts of the Loans of such Class held by them;
and (d) each payment of interest on Revolving Credit Loans and Term Loans by
Borrower shall be made for account of the relevant Lenders pro rata in
accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to
the respective Lenders.

                  4.03. Computations. Interest on LIBOR Loans and commitment
fees and letter of credit fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day) occurring in the period for which such amounts are payable and interest on
ABR Loans and Reimbursement Obligations shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such
amounts are payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for each day that the
Alternate Base Rate is calculated by reference to the Federal Funds Rate,
interest on ABR Loans and Reimbursement Obligations shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

                  4.04. Minimum Amounts. Except for mandatory prepayments made
pursuant to Section 2.10, Conversions or prepayments made pursuant to Section
5.04 and borrowings hereunder to finance any payment made in respect of a Letter
of Credit, each borrowing, Conversion and prepayment of principal of Loans
(other than Swing Loans, for which the minimum amounts thereof are in Section
2.01(d)) shall be in an amount at least equal to $500,000 (or, if less, the
remaining aggregate principal amount thereof) with respect to ABR Loans and
$1,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining aggregate principal amount thereof) with
respect to LIBOR Loans and in multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof
(borrowings, Conversions or prepayments of or into Loans of different Types or,
in the case of LIBOR Loans, having different Interest Periods at the same time
hereunder to be deemed separate borrowings, Conversions and prepayments for
purposes of the foregoing, one for each Type or Interest Period).

                  4.05. Certain Notices. Notices by Borrower to the
Administrative Agent of terminations or reductions of the Commitments, of
borrowings, Conversions, Continuations and optional prepayments of Loans and of
Classes of Loans, of Types of Loans and of the duration of Interest Periods
shall be irrevocable and shall be effective only if received by the
Administrative Agent not later than the New York time specified in the table
below on the number of Business Days prior to the date of the relevant
termination, reduction, borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or prepayment or the
first day of such Interest Period specified in the table below.

                  Each such notice of termination or reduction shall specify the
amount and the Class of the Commitments to be terminated or reduced. Each such
notice of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or prepayment shall specify the

Section 4.05, such Loan (if outstanding as a LIBOR Loan) will be automatically
Converted into an ABR Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period
for such Loan or (if outstanding as an ABR Loan) will remain as, or (if not then
outstanding) will be made as, an ABR Loan. In the event that Borrower fails to

otherwise as provided in this Section 4.05, such Interest Period shall be for
one month.

4.06. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or
Borrower (the "Payor") prior to the date on which the Payor is to make payment
to the Administrative Agent of (in the case of a Lender) the proceeds of a Loan
to be made by such Lender hereunder or a payment to the Administrative Agent for
the account of one or more of the Lenders hereunder (such payment being herein
called the "Required Payment"), which notice shall be effective upon receipt,
that the Payor does not intend to make the Required Payment to the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Required
Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not
be required to), make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient(s)
on such date; and, if the Payor has not in fact made the Required Payment to the
Administrative Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on demand, repay
to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date (the
"Advance Date") such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent
until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum
equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day and, if such recipient(s) shall
fail promptly to make such payment, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to recover such amount, on demand, from the Payor, together with interest as
aforesaid; provided, however, that if neither the recipient(s) nor the Payor
shall return the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent within three
Business Days of the date such demand was made, then, retroactively to the
Advance Date, the Payor and the recipient(s) shall each be obligated to pay
interest on the Required Payment as follows (without double recovery):


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

                  (i) if the Required Payment shall represent a payment to be
         made by Borrower to the Lenders, Borrower and the recipient(s) shall
         each be obligated retroactively to the Advance Date to pay interest in
         respect of the Required Payment at the rate set forth in Section
         3.02(b) (without duplication of the obligation of Borrower under
         Section 3.02 to pay interest on the Required Payment at the rate set
         forth in Section 3.02(b)), it being understood that the return by the
         recipient(s) of the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent shall
         not limit such obligation of Borrower under Section 3.02 to pay
         interest at the rate set forth in Section 3.02(b) in respect of the
         Required Payment and

                  (ii) if the Required Payment shall represent proceeds of a
         Loan to be made by the Lenders to Borrower, the Payor and Borrower
         shall each be obligated retroactively to the Advance Date to pay
         interest in respect of the Required Payment pursuant to Section 3.02,
         it being understood that the return by Borrower of the Required Payment
         to the Administrative Agent shall not limit any claim Borrower may have
         against the Payor in respect of such Required Payment.

                  4.07. Right of Setoff; Sharing of Payments; Etc. (a) Each
Obligor agrees that, in addition to (and without limitation of) any right of
setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim a Lender may otherwise have, each Lender
shall be entitled, at its option (to the fullest extent permitted by law), to
set off and apply any deposit (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final), or other indebtedness, held by it for the credit or account of such
Obligor at any of its offices, in Dollars or in any other currency, against any
principal of or interest on any of such Lender's Loans, Reimbursement
Obligations or any other amount payable to such Lender hereunder that is not
paid when due (regardless of whether such deposit or other indebtedness is then
due to such Obligor), in which case it shall promptly notify such Obligor and
the Administrative Agent thereof; provided, however, that such Lender's failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof.

                  (a) Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive
(other than pursuant to Section 5) any amount hereunder (whether by voluntary
payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of setoff or
banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right
under the Credit Documents, or otherwise) which is applicable to the payment of
the principal of, or interest on, the Loans, Reimbursement Obligations or fees,
of a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums received by other Lenders
is in a greater proportion than the total of such amounts then owed and due to
such Lender bears to the total of such amounts then owed and due to all of the
Lenders immediately prior to such receipt, then such Lender receiving such
excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the
other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of the respective Obligor to such
Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all of
the Lenders in such amount; provided, however, that if all or any portion of
such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall
be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest. Borrower consents to the foregoing arrangements.

                  (b) Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a
participation may exercise all rights of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or
similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were a direct holder of Loans or other amounts (as the case may be) owing to
such Lender in the amount of such participation.

                  (c) Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to
exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and
retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other
indebtedness or obligation of any Obligor. If, under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of
a setoff to which this Section 4.07 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent
practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured


                                      -50-
<PAGE>


claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this
Section 4.07 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

                  Section 5. Yield Protection, Etc.

                  5.01. Additional Costs. (a) If the adoption of, or any change
in, any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or
compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority or the
NAIC made subsequent to the Closing Date:

                  (i) shall subject any Lender or Issuing Lender to any tax of
         any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Note, any
         Letter of Credit or any Lender's participation therein, any Letter of
         Credit Document or any LIBOR Loan made by it or change the basis of
         taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof by any
         Governmental Authority (except for taxes covered by or expressly
         excluded from coverage by Section 5.06 and changes in the rate of tax
         on the overall net income or taxable income for any applicable minimum
         tax or alternative minimum tax of such Lender or its Applicable Lending
         Office, or any affiliate thereof or franchise tax by any Governmental
         Authority);

                  (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
         held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
         advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other
         acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender or Issuing Lender
         which is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate
         hereunder; or

                  (iii) shall impose on such Lender or Issuing Lender any other
         condition (excluding taxes);

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
Issuing Lender, by an amount which such Lender or Issuing Lender deems to be
material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Loans or
issuing or participating in Letters of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable
hereunder in respect thereof then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay
such Lender or Issuing Lender, upon its written demand, any additional amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender for such increased cost or
reduced amount receivable; provided, however, that a Lender that is an assignee
or transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.11 or
13.06 that was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment
or transfer shall be entitled to additional amounts pursuant to this Section
5.01 on the assigned or transferred interest only to the same extent as the
assignor Lender. If any Lender or Issuing Lender becomes entitled to claim any
additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it shall promptly notify
Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it
has become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts setting forth
the calculation of such additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.01
submitted by such Lender or Issuing Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to
Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of clearly demonstrable error.
Without limiting the survival of any other covenant hereunder, this Section 5.01
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

                  (b) In the event that any Lender or Issuing Lender shall have
determined that the adoption of any law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding
capital adequacy (or any change after the date hereof therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof) or compliance by any Lender or Issuing
Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender or Issuing Lender with any
request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force
of law) from any central bank or Governmental


                                      -51-
<PAGE>


Authority or the NAIC, in each case, made subsequent to the date hereof
including, without limitation, the issuance of any final rule, regulation or
guideline, does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's or Issuing Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of
its obligations hereunder or under any Letter of Credit to a level below that
which such Lender or Issuing Lender or such corporation could have achieved but
for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's
or Issuing Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or Issuing Lender to be material,
then from time to time, after submission by such Lender or Issuing Lender to
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request
therefor, Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender
for such reduction.

                  (c) Each Lender (and Issuing Lender) shall notify Borrower of
any event that will entitle such Lender (or Issuing Lender, as the case may be)
to compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5.01 as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within 90 days after such Lender (or Issuing
Lender, as the case may be) obtains actual knowledge thereof; provided, however,
that (i) if any Lender (or Issuing Lender, as the case may be) fails to give
such notice within 90 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event,
such Lender (or Issuing Lender, as the case may be) shall, with respect to
compensation payable pursuant to this Section 5.01 in respect of any costs
resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section 5.01
for costs incurred from and after the date 90 days prior to the date that such
Lender (or Issuing Lender, as the case may be) does give such notice and (ii)
each Lender (or Issuing Lender, as the case may be), will designate a different
Applicable Lending Office for the Loans of such Lender (or the Letters of
Credit, as the case may be) affected by such event if such designation will
avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in
the sole opinion of such Lender (or Issuing Lender, as the case may be), be
disadvantageous to such Lender (or Issuing Lender, as the case may be). Each
Lender (or Issuing Lender, as the case may be) will furnish to Borrower at the
time of request for compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5.01
a certificate setting forth the basis, amount and reasonable detail of
computation of each request by such Lender for compensation under paragraph (a)
or (b) of this Section 5.01, which certificate shall, except for demonstrable
error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.

                  5.02. Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any LIBOR Base
Rate for any Interest Period:

                  (i) the Administrative Agent determines, which determination
         shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, that quotations of interest
         rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR
         Base Rate" in Section 1.01 are not being provided in the relevant
         amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining
         rates of interest for LIBOR Loans as provided herein; or

                  (ii) if the related Loans are Revolving Credit Loans, the
         Majority Revolving Credit Lenders or, if the related Loans are Term
         Loans, the Majority Term Loan Lenders, determine, which determination
         shall be conclusive, that the relevant rates of interest referred to in
         the definition of "LIBOR Base Rate" in Section 1.01 upon the basis of
         which the rate of interest for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is
         to be determined are not likely adequate to cover the cost to the
         applicable Lenders of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans for such
         Interest Period,

then the Administrative Agent shall give Borrower and each Lender prompt notice
thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect, the affected Lenders
shall be under no obligation to make additional LIBOR Loans (but shall make
their portion of any additional Borrowings as ABR Loans), to Continue LIBOR
Loans or to Convert ABR Loans into LIBOR Loans and Borrower shall, on the last
day(s) of the

                                      -52-
<PAGE>


then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding LIBOR Loans, either prepay
such Loans of such affected Lenders or Convert such Loans of such affected
Lenders into ABR Loans in accordance with Section 2.09.

                  5.03. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that any change in any Requirement of Law or in the
interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender or
Issuing Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to make
or maintain LIBOR Loans or issue Letters of Credit hereunder (and, in the sole
opinion of such Lender or Issuing Lender, the designation of a different
Applicable Lending Office would either not avoid such unlawfulness or would be
disadvantageous to such Lender or Issuing Lender), then such Lender or Issuing
Lender shall promptly notify Borrower thereof (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) and such Lender's or Issuing Lender's obligation to make or Continue, or
to Convert Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR Loans or issue Letters of Credit
shall be suspended until such time as such Lender or Issuing Lender may again
make and maintain LIBOR Loans or issue Letters of Credit (in which case the
provisions of Section 5.04 shall be applicable).

                  5.04. Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation of any
Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert ABR Loans into, LIBOR
Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.03, such Lender's LIBOR Loans
shall be automatically Converted into ABR Loans on the last day(s) of the then
current Interest Period(s) for such LIBOR Loans (or on such earlier date as such
Lender may specify to Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent as is
required by law) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided
below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.03 which gave rise to such
Conversion no longer exist:

                  (i) to the extent that such Lender's LIBOR Loans have been so
         Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal which would
         otherwise be applied to such Lender's LIBOR Loans shall be applied
         instead to its ABR Loans; and

                  (ii) all Loans which would otherwise be made or Continued by
         such Lender as LIBOR Loans shall be made or Continued instead as ABR
         Loans and all ABR Loans of such Lender which would otherwise be
         Converted into LIBOR Loans shall remain as ABR Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent
that the circumstances specified in Section 5.03 which gave rise to the
Conversion of such Lender's LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section 5.04 no longer
exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing
to exist) at a time when LIBOR Loans are outstanding, such Lender's ABR Loans
shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding
Interest Period(s) for such outstanding LIBOR Loans, to the extent necessary so
that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding LIBOR
Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and
Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

                  5.05. Compensation. (a) Borrower agrees to indemnify each
Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such
Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (1) default by Borrower in
payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Loan, (2)
default by Borrower in making a borrowing of, Conversion into or Continuation of
LIBOR Loans after Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, (3) default by Borrower in making any
prepayment after Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the
provisions of the Agreement, or (4) the making of a payment or a prepayment of
LIBOR Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with
respect thereto, including in each case, any such loss (excluding loss of
margin) or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from
fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.


                                      -53-
<PAGE>


                  (a) For the purpose of calculation of all amounts payable to a
Lender under this Section 5.05 each Lender shall be deemed to have actually
funded its relevant LIBOR Loan through the purchase of a deposit bearing
interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loan
and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided,
however, that each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees
fit, and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of
amounts payable under this subsection. Any Lender requesting compensation
pursuant to this Section 5.05 will furnish to the Administrative Agent and
Borrower a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of such request and
such certificate, absent manifest error, shall be conclusive. Without limiting
the survival of any other covenant hereunder, this covenant shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

                  5.06. Net Payments. (a) All payments made by Borrower or any
Guarantor hereunder or under any Note or any Guarantee will be made without
setoff, counterclaim or other defense. Except as provided in Section 5.06(b),
all such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for, any Taxes now or hereafter imposed by any Governmental
Authority or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein
with respect to such payments (but excluding any Excluded Tax) and all interest,
penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (all such Taxes (other
than Excluded Taxes) being referred to collectively as "Covered Taxes"). If any
Covered Taxes are so levied or imposed, Borrower and each Guarantor, as the case
may be, agrees (on a joint and several basis) to pay the full amount of such
Covered Taxes, and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every
payment of all amounts due under this Agreement, the Guarantees or under any
Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Covered Taxes
(including any covered Taxes attributable to any amounts under this Section
5.06), will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note or
Guarantee. Borrower and each Guarantor, as the case may be, will furnish to the
Administrative Agent within 45 days after the date the payment of any Covered
Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax receipts or
other documentation reasonably satisfactory to such Lender or Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, evidencing such payment by Borrower or any Guarantor.
Borrower and the Guarantors agree (jointly and severally) to indemnify and hold
harmless each Lender, and the Administrative Agent and reimburse such Lender or
Administrative Agent, promptly upon its written request, for the amount of any
Covered Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender or Administrative
Agent and any liability (including penalties, additions to tax, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such Covered
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority; provided that if any Obligor determines in good faith that a
reasonable basis exists for contesting any Covered Taxes or Other Taxes for
which an increase in the amount of such payment is made or for which
indemnification has been demanded pursuant to this Section 5.06, such Lender or
the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall cooperate with such Obligor in
challenging such Covered Taxes or Other Taxes at such Obligor's expense if so
requested by such Obligor in writing.

                  "Excluded Taxes" shall mean any Tax (other than any Other
Taxes) imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender
pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or the
jurisdiction in which the principal office or Applicable Lending Office of such
Lender is located or any jurisdiction in which such Lender conducts business
(other than a business deemed to arise solely from the transactions contemplated
herein) or any subdivision thereof or therein.

                  (a) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such
term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (a "Non-U.S. Lender") agrees to deliver to Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of a
Non-U.S. Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this
Agreement pursuant to Section 2.11 or 13.06 (unless the respective Non-U.S.
Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such


                                      -54-
<PAGE>


assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such
Non-U.S. Lender, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN claiming eligibility of the
Non-U.S. Lender for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States
is a party (or successor forms) certifying to such Non-U.S. Lender's entitlement
to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to
payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note (or, with respect to
any assignee Lender, an exemption at least as extensive as the assigning
Lender), or (ii) if the Non-U.S. Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit L (any such certificate, a "Section 5.06
Certificate") and (y) two accurate and complete original signed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN (or successor form) certifying to such
Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax
with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note (or,
with respect to any assignee Lender, an exemption at least as extensive as the
assigning Lender). At the request of Borrower, each Lender that is a United
States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (a "U.S. Lender"), other than a U.S. Lender
that is a corporation or financial institution (an "Exempt Lender"), agrees to
deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date, or in the case of a U.S. Lender that is not an Exempt Lender
and that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Agreement
pursuant to Section 2.11 or 13.06 (unless the respective U.S. Lender was already
a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the
date of such assignment or transfer to such U.S. Lender, two accurate and
complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or
successor form) in order to demonstrate such Lender's entitlement to a complete
exemption from United States back-up withholding tax with respect to payments to
be made under this Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each Lender agrees
that from time to time after the Closing Date, when a lapse in time or change in
circumstances renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any
material respect, it will deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent two
new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN, and a Section 5.06 Certificate, or Form W-9 (if a Form
W-9 was previously provided to Borrower and the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Borrower's request), as the case may be, and such other forms as may be required
in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued
exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to
payments under this Agreement and any Note, or it shall immediately notify
Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to deliver any such form
or certificate, in which case such Lender shall not be required to deliver any
such form or certificate pursuant to this Section 5.06(b). Notwithstanding,
anything to the contrary in this Section 5.06, no Lender shall be required under
this Section 5.06(b) to deliver any such form or certificate if a change any
applicable law, treaty, regulation, or administrative order, notice or
pronouncement, or in the official interpretation thereof, has occurred prior to
the date on which such delivery would otherwise be required that renders any
such form or certificate inapplicable or would prevent the Lender from duly
completing and delivering any such form or certificate with respect to it and
such Lender so advises Borrower. Neither Borrower nor any Guarantor shall be
required to indemnify any Non-U.S. Lender, or to pay any additional amounts to
any Non-U.S. Lender, in respect of any Covered Taxes to the extent that the
obligation to pay such Covered Taxes would not have arisen but for a failure by
such Non-U.S. Lender to comply with the provisions of this Section 5.06(b).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or
elsewhere in this Section 5.06 and except as set forth in Section 13.06(b),
Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the
manner set forth in Section 5.06(a) (without regard to the identity of the
jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts
deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately preceding sentence as
a result of any changes after the Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty,
governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation
thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of income or similar Covered
Taxes.


                                      -55-
<PAGE>


                  (b) In addition, Borrower agrees to pay and indemnify and hold
harmless each Lender and Administrative Agent from any and all present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or
from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement or the Notes or Guarantee, and all interest and
penalties or similar liabilities and related expenses with regard thereto
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

                  (c) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 5.06 agrees to use (at the Obligors' expense)
reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if it
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
that may thereafter accrue; provided, however, that such change of the
Applicable Lending Office, and the filing of any certificates or forms
contemplated by the immediately succeeding sentence, would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
Each Lender shall submit to Borrower or any applicable Governmental Authority
all certificates or forms relating to Taxes reasonably requested of it by
Borrower pursuant to applicable provisions of the Code, treaties or regulations;
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation under this paragraph (d) with
respect to any Tax imposed by any jurisdiction other than the United States if
in the reasonable judgment of such Lender such compliance would subject such
Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect.

                  (d) If Borrower or any Guarantor pays any amount under this
Section 5.06 to a Lender and such Lender determines in its sole and absolute
discretion that it has actually received in connection therewith any refund (a
"Refund"), such Lender shall pay to such Borrower or such Guarantor, as the case
may be, an amount that the Lender shall, in its sole and absolute discretion,
determine is equal to the net of all out-of-pocket expenses and after tax, which
was obtained by the Lender as a consequence of such Refund; provided, however,
that (i) Borrower and the Guarantors (jointly and severally), upon the request
of the applicable Lender, agree to repay as soon as reasonably practicable the
amount paid over to such Borrower or Guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or
other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Lender in
the event such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
Authority, or such Lender loses the benefits of the Refund in question; (ii)
such Lender shall not be required to make any payment under this Section 5.06(e)
if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (iii) any taxes
that are imposed on a Lender as a result of a disallowance or reduction
(including through the expiration of any tax credit carryover or carryback of
such Lender that otherwise would not have expired) of any Refund with respect to
which such Lender has made a payment to Borrower or any Guarantor pursuant to
this Section 5.06(e) shall be treated as a tax for which Borrower or any
Guarantor is obligated to indemnify such Lender pursuant to this Section 5.06
without any exclusions or defenses; and (iv) nothing in this Section 5.06(e)
shall require the Lender to disclose any confidential information to Borrower or
any Guarantor (including its tax returns).

                  Section 6. Guarantee.

                  6.01. The Guarantee. The Guarantors hereby jointly and
severally guarantee as a primary obligor and not as a surety to each Lender,
Issuing Lender and Agent and their respective successors and assigns the prompt
payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) of the principal of and interest (including any interest, fees, costs
or charges that would accrue but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code after
any bankruptcy or insolvency petition under the Bankruptcy Code) on the Loans
made by the Lenders to, and the Notes held by each Lender of, Borrower and all
other Obligations from time to time owing to the Lenders, Indemnitees, Issuing
Lender or Agents by Borrower under this Agreement and under the Notes and by any
Obligor under any of the other Credit


                                      -56-
<PAGE>


Documents, and all obligations of Borrower or any Subsidiary to any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender in respect of any Swap Contract and all Obligations
owing to the Issuing Lender under the Letter of Credit Documents, in each case
strictly in accordance with the terms thereof (such obligations being herein
collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Guarantors hereby jointly
and severally agree that if Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether
at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, the Guarantors will promptly pay the same, without any demand or
notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or
renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in
full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in
accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

                  6.02. Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the
Guarantors under Section 6.01 are absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, joint
and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes or
any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any
substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any
of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or
Guarantor (except for payment in full). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following
shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder which shall
remain absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances
as described above:

                  (i) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the
         Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of
         the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or
         compliance shall be waived;

                  (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         this Agreement or the Notes or any other agreement or instrument
         referred to herein or therein shall be done or omitted;

                  (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall
         be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be amended
         in any respect, or any right under this Agreement, the Notes or any
         other Credit Document or any other agreement or instrument referred to
         herein or therein shall be amended or waived in any respect or any
         other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security
         therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or
         otherwise dealt with;

                  (iv) any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of,
         the Issuing Lender or any Lender or Agent as security for any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected; or

                  (v) the release of any other Guarantor.

                  The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that
the Issuing Lender or any Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy
or proceed against Borrower under this Agreement or the Notes or any other
agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or against any other
Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed
Obligations. The Guarantors waive any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension, waiver, termination or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
and notice of or proof of reliance by the Issuing Lender, any Lender or any
Agent upon this guarantee or acceptance of this guarantee, and the Guaranteed
Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created,
contracted or incurred in reliance upon this guarantee, and all dealings between
Borrower and the Issuing Lender, Lenders and Agents shall likewise be
conclusively presumed


                                      -57-
<PAGE>

to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this guarantee. This guarantee
shall be construed as a continuing, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional
guarantee of payment without regard to any right of offset with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations at any time or from time to time held by the Issuing
Lender, Lenders and Agents, and the obligations and liabilities of the
Guarantors hereunder shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by
the Issuing Lender, Lenders or Agents or any other Person at any time of any
right or remedy against Borrower or against any other Person which may be or
become liable in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or
against any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with
respect thereto. This guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be
binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantors
and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the
Lenders, and their respective successors and assigns, notwithstanding that from
time to time during the term of this Agreement there may be no Guaranteed
Obligations outstanding.

                  6.03. Reinstatement. The obligations of the Guarantors under
this Section 6 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for
any reason any payment by or on behalf of Borrower in respect of the Guaranteed
Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy
or reorganization or otherwise (and whether as a result of any demand,
settlement, litigation or otherwise). The Guarantors jointly and severally agree
that they will indemnify the Issuing Lender, each Agent and each Lender on
demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred by the Issuing Lender, such Agent or such Lender in connection
with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses
incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a
preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar law, other than any costs or expenses resulting from the
gross negligence or bad faith of such Creditor.

                  6.04. Subrogation; Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby agrees
that until the indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all
Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of
the Lenders under this Agreement it shall not exercise any right or remedy
arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 6.01,
whether by subrogation or otherwise, against Borrower or any other Guarantor of
any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed
Obligations. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of
Borrower or any other Guarantor now or hereafter owing to any Guarantor by
reason of any payment by such Guarantor under the Guarantee in this Section 6 is
hereby subordinated to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of the
Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor agrees that it will not demand, sue for
or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of Borrower to such
Guarantor until the Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in
cash and all Commitments of the Lenders under this Agreement have expired or
been terminated. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any Guarantor shall
prior to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations
and expiration or termination of all Commitments of the Lenders under this
Agreement collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such
indebtedness, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by such
Guarantor as trustee for the Lead Arrangers, the Agents, the Issuing Lender and
the Lenders and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on account of the
Guaranteed Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of such
Guarantor under the other provisions of the guaranty contained herein.

                  6.05. Remedies. The Guarantors jointly and severally agree
that, as between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of Borrower
under this Agreement and the Notes may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable as provided in Section 10 (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 10)
for purposes of Section 6.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations


                                      -58-
<PAGE>


from becoming automatically due and payable) as against Borrower and that, in
the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable
by Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for
purposes of Section 6.01.

                  6.06. Instrument for the Payment of Money. Each Guarantor
hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Section 6 constitutes an
instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Lender or
Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Guarantor in the
payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring a
motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213.

                  6.07. Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Section 6 is
a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever
arising.

                  6.08. General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any
action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, Federal or
foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights
of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 6.01
would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or
unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account
of the amount of its liability under Section 6.01, then, notwithstanding any
other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any
further action by such Guarantor, any Lender, any Agent or any other Person, be
automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and
enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined
in such action or proceeding.

                  Section 7. Conditions Precedent.

                  7.01. Effectiveness of Credit Agreement and Initial Extension
of Credit Under the Credit Agreement. The effectiveness of the Credit Documents
and the obligation of the Lenders to make any initial extension of credit
hereunder (whether by making a Loan or issuing a Letter of Credit) is subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent that:

                  to be a party and each other document to be delivered by such

         the Closing Date stating that as of the Closing Date:

                           (a) None of the execution, delivery and performance
                  by each of the Obligors of any Transaction Document to which
                  it is a party and the consummation of the transactions herein
                  and therein contemplated will (i) conflict with or result in a
                  breach of, or require any consent (which has not been obtained
                  and is in full force and effect) under (a) any Organic
                  Document of any Company, or (b) any applicable Requirement of
                  Law or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any
                  Governmental Authority binding on any Company, or any term or
                  provision of any Contractual Obligation of any Company, or
                  (ii) constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a
                  default under any such Contractual Obligation, or (iii) result

                  Liens created pursuant to the Security Documents) upon any
                  Property of any Company pursuant to the terms of any such
                  Contractual Obligation, except with respect to each of




                                      -63-
<PAGE>


                  the foregoing (other than (i)(a)) which is not (either
                  individually or in the aggregate) reasonably likely to have a
                  Material Adverse Effect.

                           (b) Each of the Obligors has all necessary corporate
                  power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver and
                  perform its obligations under each Transaction Document to
                  which it is a party and to consummate the transactions herein
                  and therein contemplated; the execution, delivery and
                  performance by each of the Obligors of each Transaction
                  Document to which it is a party and the consummation of the
                  transactions herein and therein contemplated have been duly
                  authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part; each
                  of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party when
                  executed and delivered by such Obligor will constitute, its
                  legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against each
                  of the Obligors in accordance with its terms, except as such
                  enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
                  fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar
                  laws of general applicability from time to time in effect
                  affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies
                  and (b) the application of general principles of equity
                  (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
                  proceeding in equity or at law).

                           (c) No authorizations, approvals or consents of, and
                  no filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority
                  or any securities exchange are necessary for the execution,
                  delivery or performance by any Obligor of the Transaction
                  Documents to which it is a party or for the legality, validity
                  or enforceability thereof or for the consummation of the
                  transactions therein contemplated, except for filings and
                  recordings in respect of the Liens created pursuant to the
                  Security Documents and, in connection with the Transactions,
                  except for consents, filings and authorizations that have been
                  maintained or made and are in full force and effect.

                           (d) There does not exist any judgment, order or
                  injunction prohibiting or imposing material adverse conditions
                  upon any of the Transactions or the performance by any Obligor
                  of its obligations under the Transaction Documents.

                  (xix) Financial Officer Certificate. A certificate dated the
         Closing Date signed by the Chief Financial Officer of Borrower stating
         that as of the Closing Date:

                           (a) Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders
                  the consolidated balance sheets and related statements of
                  income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of Borrower (i) as
                  of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
                  2000, audited by and accompanied by the opinion of
                  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent public accountants,
                  and (ii) as of and for the three, six and nine month periods
                  ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2003 and for the
                  comparable periods of the preceding fiscal year. Such
                  financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
                  GAAP consistently applied and present fairly and accurately
                  the financial condition and results of operations and cash
                  flows of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of such dates and
                  for such periods.

                           (b) The financial statements delivered pursuant to
                  Section 7.01(i)(9) have been prepared in good faith by the
                  Obligors, based on the assumptions stated therein (which
                  assumptions are believed by the Obligors on the date hereof
                  and on the Closing Date to be reasonable), are based on the
                  best information available to the Obligors as of the date of
                  delivery thereof, accurately reflect all adjustments required
                  to be made to give effect to the Transactions, and present
                  fairly on a pro forma basis the estimated


                                      -64-
<PAGE>


                  consolidated financial position and results of operations of
                  Borrower as of and for such dates, assuming that the
                  Transactions had actually occurred at such dates, subject to
                  period end audit adjustments that would be made in audited
                  financial statements.

                           (c) Except as set forth in the financial statements
                  or other information referred to in Section 7.01(xix)(a), as
                  of the Closing Date there are no material liabilities of any
                  Company of any kind, whether accrued, contingent, absolute,
                  determined, determinable or otherwise, and there is no
                  existing condition, situation or set of circumstances which is
                  reasonably likely to result in such a liability, other than:

                                    (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary
                           course of business consistent with past practice
                           since December 31, 2002 which in the aggregate are
                           not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
                           Effect; and

                                    (ii) liabilities under this Agreement and
                           the other Credit Documents or the Transaction
                           Documents or liabilities incurred in connection with
                           the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (i) No Default; Representations and Warranties True. Both
         immediately prior to the making of such Loan or other extension of
         credit and also after giving pro forma effect thereto and to the

                           (a) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
                  and

                           (b) the representations and warranties made by the
                  Obligors in Section 8, and by each Obligor in each of the
                  other Credit Documents to which it is a party, shall be true
                  and correct in all material respects (except that any
                  representation or warranty that is qualified as to
                  "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be true and
                  correct in all respects) on and as of the date of the making
                  of such Loan or other extension of credit with the same force
                  and effect as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such
                  representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been
                  made as of a specific date, as of such specific date).

                  (ii) No Legal Bar. The Loans and the use of proceeds thereof
         shall not contravene, violate or conflict with, nor involve any Lender
         in a violation of, any law, rule, injunction, or regulation or
         determination of any court of law or other Governmental Authority.

                  (iii) No Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 2002,
         there shall not have been any Material Adverse Change with respect to
         Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

                  7.03. Release from Escrow Account. The obligation of the
Collateral Agent to instruct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Funds from
the Escrow Account shall be subject to the conditions precedent that:


                                      -65-
<PAGE>

                  (i) No Event of Default. Both immediately prior to such
         release and also after giving pro forma effect thereto and to the
         intended use of the Escrowed Funds no Event of Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing.

                  (ii) No Legal Bar. Such release and the use of proceeds of the
         Escrowed Funds shall not contravene, violate or conflict with, nor
         involve any Lender in a violation of, any law, rule, injunction, or
         regulation or determination of any court of law or other Governmental
         Authority.

                  (iii) Superior Acquisition. The Lead Arrangers shall have
         reviewed, and be reasonably satisfied with, the final terms and
         conditions and the documentation relating to the Superior Acquisition
         (including, without limitation, the amount and form of the financing
         thereof). The Superior Acquisition shall be consummated on or before
         the date that is 60 days following the Closing Date in accordance with
         such documentation without any material, or otherwise adverse to the
         Lenders, waiver or amendment thereof unless consented to by the Lead
         Arrangers.

                  (iv) Due Diligence. As of the date that, except for the
         release of the Escrowed Funds, Borrower is prepared to consummate the
         Superior Acquisition, no facts or information concerning Superior shall
         have become known to the Lenders which, after giving effect to the
         consummation of the Superior Acquisition, would reasonably be expected
         to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  7.04. Certifications. (a) Each notice of borrowing or request
for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or release of the Escrowed Funds by
Borrower hereunder shall constitute a certification by Borrower to the effect
set forth in Section 7.02(i) or Section 7.03(i), as applicable (both as of the
date of such notice or request and, unless Borrower otherwise notifies
Administrative Agent prior to the date of such borrowing, issuance or release,
as of the date of such borrowing, issuance or release).

                  (a) Each notice submitted by Borrower hereunder for an
extension of credit or release of the Escrowed Funds hereunder shall constitute
a representation and warranty by Borrower, as of the date of such notice and as
of the relevant borrowing date, date of issuance of a Letter of Credit or
release of the Escrowed Funds, as applicable, that the applicable conditions in
Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 7.03 have been satisfied or waived in accordance with
the terms hereof.

                  Each of the Obligors represents and warrants to the Creditors
that, on the Closing Date and at and as of each Funding Date (in each case
immediately before and immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated to occur on such date (including the Transactions)):

                  8.01. Corporate Existence. Each Obligor and each Subsidiary:
(a) is a corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization; (b) has all requisite corporate or other power and authority, and
has all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals necessary
to own its Property and carry on its business as now being conducted, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect; and (c) is qualified to do business and is in good
standing in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by
it makes such qualification necessary and where failure to be so qualified and
in good standing individually or in the aggregate is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  8.02. Financial Condition; Etc. Except as set forth in the
financial statements referred to in Section 7.01(xix)(a), since December 31,
2002, there has been no Material Adverse Effect or any event, change or
circumstance which could reasonably be expected to cause or evidence, either
individually or together with any other events, changes and circumstances, a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  8.03. Litigation. Except as disclosed on Schedule 8.03, there
is no Proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of any Company threatened
in writing against or affecting, any Company or any of its respective Properties
before any Governmental Authority that has a reasonable likelihood of being
adversely determined and that, if determined or resolved adversely to such
Company in accordance with the plaintiff's demands, is reasonably likely to have
(individually or in the aggregate) a Material Adverse Effect.

                  8.04. No Breach; No Default. (a) None of the execution,
delivery and performance by each of the Obligors of any Credit Document to which
it is a party and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein
contemplated will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of, or require any
consent (which has not been obtained and is in full force and effect) under (a)
any Organic Document of any Company, or (b) any applicable Requirement of Law or
any order, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority binding on
any Company, or any term or provision of any Contractual Obligation of any
Company, or (ii) constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under any such Contractual Obligation, or (iii) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien (except for the Liens created pursuant to the Security
Documents) upon any Property of any Company pursuant to the terms of any such
Contractual Obligation, except with respect to each of the foregoing (other than
(i)(a)) which is not (either individually or in the aggregate) reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (a) No Company is in default under or with respect to any
Contractual Obligation or any order, award or decree of any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator binding upon it or any of its Property in any respect
which is likely to have (individually or in the aggregate) a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (b) No Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  8.05. Action. Each of the Obligors has all necessary corporate
power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under each Credit Document to which it is a party and to consummate the
transactions herein and therein contemplated; the execution, delivery and
performance by each of the Obligors of each Credit Document to which it is a
party and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part; and
this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of the
Obligors and constitutes, and each of the Notes and the other Credit Documents
to which it is a party when executed and delivered by such Obligor (in the case
of the Notes, for value) will constitute, its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against each of the Obligors in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of
general applicability from time to time in effect affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights and remedies and (b) the application of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law).

                  8.06. Approvals. No authorizations, approvals or consents of,
and no filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority or any
securities exchange are necessary for the execution, delivery or performance by
any Obligor of the Credit Documents to which it is a party or for the legality,
validity or enforceability hereof or thereof or for the consummation of the
transactions herein and therein


                                      -67-

contemplated, except for filings and recordings in respect of the Liens created
pursuant to the Security Documents.

                  8.07. Representations and Warranties in Transaction Documents.
The representations and warranties of each Company set forth in each Transaction
Document were, in each case, true and correct in all material respects as of the
time such representations and warranties were made or deemed made. As of the
Closing Date, to the best knowledge of each Company, the representations and
warranties of each party other than the Companies to each Transaction Document
contained therein were true and correct in all material respects on the date
made.

                  8.08. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability could be reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the
assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting
such amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded
Plans by an amount that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan maintained by such Company. Using actuarial assumptions
and computation methods consistent with subpart 1 of subtitle E of Title IV of
ERISA, the aggregate liabilities of any ERISA Entity to all Multiemployer Plans
in the event of a complete withdrawal therefrom, as of the close of the most
recent fiscal year of each such Multiemployer Plan, would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  Each Foreign Plan has been maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable
laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been maintained, where
required, in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities, except where
failure to do so would not be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Borrower nor any Subsidiary have incurred any obligation in connection
with the termination of or withdrawal from any Foreign Plan which could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value
of the accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Foreign
Plan which is funded, determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal
year of Borrower or Subsidiary, as applicable, on the basis of actuarial
assumptions, each of which is, and which collectively are, reasonable, did not
exceed the current value of the assets of such Foreign Plan by an amount that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and for each
Foreign Plan which is not funded, the obligations of such Foreign Plan, to the
extent such obligations are material, are properly accrued.

                  8.09. Taxes. (i) Each Company has timely filed or caused to be
timely filed all U.S. federal income tax returns and all other returns,
statements, forms and reports for taxes (the "Returns"), domestic or foreign,
required to be filed by it, except for those returns the failure of which to be
filed would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and
has timely paid all Taxes payable by it which have become due or any assessments
made against it or any of its Property and all other Taxes, fees or other
charges imposed on it or any of its Property (including the Mortgaged Real
Property) by any Governmental Authority (other than those which, in the
aggregate, are not substantial in amount or those the amount or validity of
which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the
books of the relevant Company, as the case may be, and which contested Tax
individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect); the Returns accurately reflect in all material
respects all liability for Taxes of the relevant Company for the periods covered
thereby; and no Tax lien has been filed (except with respect to taxes not yet
due and payable) and, to the best knowledge of the Obligors, no action, suit,
proceeding, investigation, audit or claim is being asserted or has been



                                      -68-
<PAGE>


threatened in writing or otherwise by any authority with respect to any such
Tax, fee or other charge, except as could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) no Company
has entered into an agreement or waiver extending any statute of limitations
relating to the payment or collection of Taxes of any Company.

                  8.10. Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company
Act; Other Restrictions. No Company is an "investment company," or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company," within the meaning of the United States
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. No Company is a "holding company,"
or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," within the meaning of the United States Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended. No Obligor is subject to regulation under any law or
regulation which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness, other than Regulation
X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

                  8.11. Environmental Matters. Except as disclosed on Schedule
8.11 and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect: (i) each Company is in
compliance with and in the last two years has been in compliance with, and is
not subject to liability under, any Environmental Laws applicable to it and
there are no Environmental Laws which would reasonably be expected to result in
material expenditures by any Company, and no such Environmental Laws would
reasonably be expected to interfere in any material way with current or
projected operations of any Company; (ii) no Company has received written notice
that it or any of its predecessors in interest has been or may be identified as
a potentially responsible party under the United States Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended
("CERCLA"), or any other Environmental Law, nor has any Company received notice
that any Hazardous Materials that it or any of its predecessors in interest has
used, generated, stored, treated, handled, transported or disposed of, or
arranged for disposal or treatment of, have been found at any site at which any
Person is conducting or plans to conduct any action pursuant to any
Environmental Law, and no Company, or to the knowledge of the Obligors, any of
their respective predecessors in interest, has disposed of, arranged for the
disposal or treatment of, or otherwise released Hazardous Materials at any site
at which any Person is conducting or plans to conduct any action under
Environmental Law; (iii) no properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated
by any Company or any of their respective predecessors in interest, are (x)
listed or proposed for listing on the National Priorities List under CERCLA or
(y) listed on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Information System List promulgated pursuant to CERCLA or (z) included
on any similar lists maintained by any Governmental Authority; (iv) there are no
past or present events, conditions, activities, practices or actions, or any
agreements, judgments, decrees or orders by which any Company or any of its
predecessors in interest is bound, which would reasonably be expected to prevent
any Company's compliance with any Environmental Law, or which would reasonably
be expected to give rise to any liability of any Company under any Environmental
Law, including, without limitation, liability under CERCLA or similar state or
foreign laws; (v) no Lien has been asserted or recorded, or to the knowledge of
the Obligors, threatened, under any Environmental Law with respect to any asset,
facility, inventory or property currently owned, leased or operated by any
Company; (vi) there has been no Release or threat of Release of Hazardous
Material at, on, from, under or affecting any real property now or previously
owned, operated or leased by any Company or, to the knowledge of the Obligors,
any predecessor in interest; and (vii) no Company is subject to any
Environmental Claim and, to the knowledge of the Obligors, no Environmental
Claim is threatened.

                  8.12. Environmental Investigations. All material environmental
investigations, studies, audits, assessments and data which are in the
possession, custody or control of any Company relating (i) to the current or
prior business, operations, facilities or Property of any Company or any of
their respective predecessors in interest or (ii) to any facility, Property or
other asset now or previously owned,


                                      -69-
<PAGE>


operated, leased or used by any Company or any of their respective predecessors
in interest have been made available to the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders.

                  8.13. Use of Proceeds. No Company is engaged principally, or
as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying Margin
Stock and no part of the proceeds of any extension of credit hereunder will be
used directly or indirectly and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately
to purchase or carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for such
purpose or to refund Indebtedness originally incurred for such purpose. Borrower
will use the proceeds of (A) all Term Loans made on the Closing Date to finance
in part the Transactions and, if consummated, the Superior Acquisition, and, in
each case, to pay related fees and expenses and (B) all Revolving Credit Loans
for working capital and general corporate purposes of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries.

                  Following application of the proceeds of each extension of
credit hereunder, not more than 25 percent of the value of the assets (either of
Borrower only or of Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries) will be Margin
Stock. If requested by any Lender or the Lead Arranger, Borrower will furnish to
the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in
conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to in Regulation U.

                  8.14. Subsidiaries. As of the Closing Date (after giving
effect to the Transactions), none of Borrower or Holdings has any Subsidiaries
or interests in partnerships, joint ventures or business trusts other than the
entities set forth on Schedule 8.14. Borrower and Holdings own, as of the
Closing Date, the percentage of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests or
other evidences of the ownership of each of their respective Subsidiaries,
partnerships or joint ventures listed on Schedule 8.14 as set forth on such
Schedule. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.14, no such Subsidiary, partnership
or joint venture has issued any securities convertible into shares of its Equity
Interests (or other evidence of ownership) or any Equity Rights to acquire such
shares or securities convertible into such shares (or other evidence of
ownership), and the outstanding stock and securities (or other evidence of
ownership) of such Subsidiaries, partnerships or joint ventures are owned by
Borrower or Holdings free and clear of all Liens and Equity Rights of others of
any kind whatsoever, except for Liens pursuant to the Security Documents.
Holdings does not have any direct equity interest in any Person other than
Borrower.

                  8.15. Properties. Each of the Companies (i) has good title to
and beneficial ownership of all Property owned by it, including all the Property
reflected in the most recent financial statements provided hereunder (except
Property sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary
course of business or as otherwise not prohibited by the Credit Documents), or
acquired after the date thereof, free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted
Liens and (ii) is the lessee of all leasehold estates and, except as disclosed
on Schedule 8.15, is in possession of the Properties purported to be leased
thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the
lessee or, to the knowledge of the Obligors, the lessor. Title to all Property
of any Company is held by such Company free and clear of all Liens except for
Permitted Liens. The Real Property listed on Schedule 8.15 constitutes, as of
the Closing Date, all of the Real Property owned or leased by any Company as of
the Closing Date and such schedule describes the type of interest therein held
by such Company.

                  8.16. Security Documents. (a) The Security Agreement is
effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Creditors, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in and Lien on the
Security Agreement Collateral and, when (i) financing statements and other
filings in appropriate form are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 6 to
the Perfection Certificate and (ii) upon the taking of possession or control by
the Collateral Agent of the Security Agreement Collateral with respect to which
a security interest may be perfected only by possession or control (which
possession or control shall be given to the Collateral Agent to the extent
possession or control by the Collateral Agent is


                                      -70-
<PAGE>


required by the Security Agreement), the Lien created by the Security Agreement
shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right,
title and interest of the grantors thereunder in the Security Agreement
Collateral (other than the Intellectual Property Collateral (as defined in the
Security Agreement)), in each case subject to no Liens other than Permitted
Liens (it being understood that no representation is being made as to the
perfection of any Lien or security interest under laws other than those of the
United States or any state thereof).

                  (a) When the Security Agreement or a short form thereof is
filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States
Copyright Office, the Lien created by such Security Agreement shall constitute a
fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest
of the grantors thereunder in the Intellectual Property Collateral (as defined
in such Security Agreement), in each case subject to no Liens other than
Permitted Liens.

                  (b) Each Mortgage executed and delivered by the relevant
Obligor pursuant to Sections 9.12 and 9.13 will be effective to create, in favor
of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Creditors, a legal, valid and
enforceable first priority Lien on and security interest in all of the Obligors'
right, title and interest in and to the Mortgaged Real Properties thereunder and
the proceeds thereof, and when such Mortgage is filed in the offices specified
in the local counsel opinion delivered with respect thereto in accordance with
the provisions of Sections 9.12 and 9.13, the Mortgages shall constitute fully
perfected Liens on, and security interests in, all right, title and interest of
the Obligors in the Mortgaged Real Properties and the proceeds thereof, in each
case prior and superior in right to any other person, other than Liens
reasonably acceptable to Collateral Agent.

                  (c) Each Security Document delivered pursuant to Sections 9.12
and 9.13 will, upon execution and delivery thereof, be effective to create in
favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Creditors, a legal, valid
and enforceable security interest in and Lien on all of the Obligors' right,
title and interest in and to the Collateral thereunder, and when all appropriate
filings or recordings are made in the appropriate offices as may be required
under applicable law or the Collateral Agent obtains control of the Collateral,
as applicable, such Security Document will constitute a fully perfected Lien on,
and security interest in, all right, title and interest of the Obligors in such
Collateral, in each case subject to no Liens other than the applicable Permitted
Liens.

                  8.17. Licenses and Permits; Compliance with Laws. The
Companies hold all governmental permits, licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals necessary for the Companies to own, lease, and operate their
respective Properties and to operate their respective businesses as now being
conducted (collectively, the "Permits"), except for Permits the failure of which
to obtain is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of
the Permits has been modified in any way that is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. All Permits are in full force and effect except where
the failure to be in full force and effect is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  Each Company is in material compliance with all applicable
statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, orders and regulations of any Governmental
Authority in all jurisdictions in which it is presently doing business, and each
Company will comply with all such laws and regulations which may be imposed in
the future in jurisdictions in which it may then be doing business, in each case
other than those the non-compliance with which would not (individually or in the
aggregate) reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There does
not exist any judgment, order or injunction prohibiting or imposing material
adverse conditions upon the performance by any Obligor of its obligations under
the Credit Documents and all applicable laws.

                  8.18. True and Complete Disclosure. The information, reports,
financial statements, exhibits and schedules furnished in writing by or on
behalf of any Obligor to any Creditor in connection


                                      -71-
<PAGE>


with the negotiation, preparation or delivery of this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents or included herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto or pursuant to any information memorandum distributed in connection with
the syndication of the Commitments and Loans, including all filings made with
the Commission by Borrower or any Company but in each case excluding all
projections, whether prior to or after the Closing Date, when taken as a whole,
do not, as of the date such information was furnished, contain any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements herein or therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not materially misleading. The projections and pro forma
financial information furnished at any time by any Obligor to any Creditor
pursuant to this Agreement have been prepared in good faith based on assumptions
believed by Borrower to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by
the Lenders that such financial information as it relates to future events is
not to be viewed as fact and that actual results during the period or periods
covered by such financial information may differ from the projected results set
forth therein by a material amount and no Obligor makes any representation as to
the ability of any Company to achieve the results set forth in any such
projections. Each Obligor understands that all such statements, representations
and warranties shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the Lenders as a
material inducement to make each extension of credit hereunder.

                  8.19. Solvency; Etc. The Companies, taken as a whole, are
Solvent.

                  8.20. Contracts. No Company is in default under any material
contract or agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound, nor, to
Borrower's knowledge, does any condition exist that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute such default, excluding in any case such defaults
that are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 8.20
accurately and completely lists (x) all agreements, if any, among the
stockholders (or any of their Affiliates other than any Company) of Holdings or
the LLC on the one hand and any Company on the other in effect on the date
hereof and (y) all material agreements which are in effect on the date hereof in
connection with the conduct of the business of the Companies.

                  8.21. Labor Matters. Set forth on Schedule 8.21 is a list and
description (including dates of termination) of all collective bargaining or
similar agreements between or applicable to any Company as of the date hereof
and any union, labor organization or other bargaining agent in respect of the
employees of any Company on the date indicated on Schedule 8.21. Except as set
forth on Schedule 8.21, there are no strikes or other labor disputes against any
Company pending or, to the knowledge of any Obligor, threatened which could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  8.22. Intellectual Property.

                  (a) Ownership/No Claims. Each Company owns, or is licensed to
use, all patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade names, service marks,
copyrights, technology, trade secrets, proprietary information, domain names,
know-how and processes necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted (the "Intellectual Property"), except for those the failure to own or
license which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed on Schedule
8.22, no claim has been asserted and is pending against any Company by any
person challenging or questioning any Company's use of any such Intellectual
Property or the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property, nor
does any Obligor know of any valid basis for any such claim. To each Obligor's
knowledge, the use of such Intellectual Property by each Company does not
infringe the rights of any person, except for such claims and infringements
that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.


                                      -72-
<PAGE>


                  (b) Registrations. Except pursuant to licenses and other user
agreements entered into by each Obligor in the ordinary course of business that
are listed on Schedules 13(a) and 13(b) annexed to the Perfection Certificate,
on and as of the date hereof (i) each Obligor owns and possesses the right to
use, and has done nothing to authorize or enable any other person to use, any
Copyright, Patent or Trademark (as such terms are defined in the Security
Agreement) listed on Schedules 13(a), 13(b), 13(c) and 13(d) annexed to the
Perfection Certificate and (ii) all registrations listed on Schedules 13(a),
13(b), 13(c) and 13(d) annexed to the Perfection Certificate are valid and in
full force and effect.

                  (c) No Violations or Proceedings. To each Obligor's knowledge,
on and as of the date hereof, (i) except as set forth on Schedule 8.22, there is
no material violation by others of any right of such Obligor with respect to any
Copyright, Patent or Trademark listed on Schedules 13(a), 13(b), 13(c) and 13(d)
annexed to the Perfection Certificate, respectively, pledged by it under the
name of such Obligor, (ii) such Obligor is not infringing upon any Copyright,
Patent or Trademark of any other person other than such infringement that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not (or would not reasonably be expected
to) result in a Material Adverse Effect on the value or utility of the
Intellectual Property or any portion thereof material to the use and operation
of the Collateral and (iii) no proceedings have been instituted or are pending
against such Obligor or, to such Obligor's knowledge, threatened, and no claim
against such Obligor has been received by such Obligor, alleging any such
violation, except as may be set forth on Schedule 8.22.

                  Section 9. Covenants.

                  Each Obligor, for itself and on behalf of its Subsidiaries,
covenants and agrees with the Creditors that, so long as any Commitment, Loan or
Letter of Credit Liability is outstanding and until payment in full of all
amounts payable by Borrower hereunder:

                  9.01. Financial Statements, Etc. The Companies shall deliver
to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall deliver to each
Lender within three Business Days after the receipt thereof):

                  (a) Quarterly Financials. As soon as available and in any
         event within 45 days (or, if SEC Form 12b-25 is filed in respect of
         such fiscal quarter, 50 days) after the end of each of the first three
         quarterly fiscal periods of each fiscal year, consolidated statements
         of operations of Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for such
         period, consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
         stockholders' equity of Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for
         the period from the beginning of the respective fiscal year to the end
         of such period, and the related consolidated balance sheet of Borrower
         and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of such period, setting
         forth in each case in comparative form the corresponding consolidated
         statements of operations and cash flows for the corresponding periods
         in the preceding fiscal year accompanied by a certificate of a
         Responsible Officer of Borrower, which certificate shall state that
         said consolidated financial statements fairly present the consolidated
         financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Borrower
         and its Consolidated Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, consistently
         applied, as at the end of, and for, such period (subject to normal
         year-end audit adjustments);

                  (b) Annual Financials. As soon as available and in any event
         within 90 days (or, if SEC Form 12b-25 is filed in respect of such
         fiscal year, 105 days) after the end of each fiscal year, consolidated
         statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity of
         Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for such year and the
         related consolidated balance sheet of Borrower and its Consolidated
         Subsidiaries as of the end of such year, setting forth in each case in
         comparative form the corresponding consolidated information as of the
         end of and for the


                                      -73-
<PAGE>


         preceding fiscal year, accompanied by an opinion, without material
         qualification, thereon of independent certified public accountants of
         recognized national standing, which opinion shall state that said
         consolidated financial statements fairly present the consolidated
         financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Borrower
         and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at the end of, and for, such
         fiscal year in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied; Borrower
         shall supply such additional information and detail as to any item or
         items contained on any such statement that Lenders (to the extent
         applicable) may reasonably require; all such information will be
         prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied;

                  (c) Compliance Certificate. (i) Concurrently with the delivery
         of the financial statements referred to in Section 9.01(b), a

         necessary therefor no knowledge was obtained of any Event of Default
         relating to the Financial Maintenance Covenants, except as specified in
         such certificate; and

                  (i) at the time it furnishes each set of financial statements
         pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, a certificate of a senior
         financial officer of Borrower (I) to the effect that no Default has
         occurred and is continuing (or, if any Default has occurred and is
         continuing, describing the same in reasonable detail and describing the
         action that Borrower has taken and proposes to take with respect

being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings and against which
adequate reserves are being maintained in accordance with GAAP); (iv) maintain

condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, except to the extent that the
failure to do so with respect to any such Property is not reasonably likely to

notice to examine, copy and make extracts from its books and records, to inspect

to disclose to the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders any and all financial
statements and other supporting financial documents and schedules including

instructing them to comply with the provisions of this Section 9.03(vi); (vii)
perform in all respects all of its Contractual Obligations, except where such
failure to so perform, singly or in the aggregate with all other such failures,
is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; and (viii) keep
proper books of record and accounts, in which full and correct entries shall be
made of all financial transactions and the Property and business of each Company
in accordance

                                      -76-

with GAAP in effect from time to time or as otherwise required by applicable
rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
such Company.

                  9.04. Insurance. (a) Each Company shall maintain, with
financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance of the kinds and in the
amounts customarily insured against by companies engaged in the same or similar
businesses and similarly situated (including business interruption insurance)
and any insurance required by law. Each Company shall pay all insurance premiums
payable by it as and when due. Borrower will advise the Administrative Agent and
the Collateral Agent promptly of any material policy cancellation, reduction or
amendment. Borrower will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, materially
modify any of the provisions of any policy with respect to casualty insurance
without delivering the original copy of the endorsement reflecting such
modification to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent. With respect
to the Collateral, each Company shall also maintain all insurance coverage that
may be required under any other Credit Document in such form, amounts and
coverage as is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent.

                  (a) All policies of insurance required to be maintained by any
Obligor must name the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Creditors as loss payee
(in the case of property insurance) or additional insured (in the case of
liability insurance), as applicable, or certificate holder (in the case of
workers' compensation insurance) and must provide that no cancellation,
non-renewal or modification (including reduced coverage) of the policies will be
made without thirty days' prior written notice to the Collateral Agent and if
the insurance carrier shall have received written notice from the Administrative
Agent of the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the insurance
carrier shall pay all proceeds otherwise payable to any Obligor under such
policies directly to the Collateral Agent.

                  (b) The Obligors shall give immediate written notice of any
loss in excess of $10.0 million to the insurance carrier and to Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably authorizes and
empowers the Administrative Agent, as its attorney-in-fact coupled with an
interest, if any Default shall have occurred or such loss is reasonably likely
to be materially adverse to the Lenders, to make proof of loss, to adjust and
compromise any claim under insurance policies, to appear in and prosecute any
action rising from such insurance policies, to collect and receive insurance
proceeds, and to deduct therefrom the Administrative Agent's expenses incurred
in the collection of such proceeds. Nothing contained in this Section 9.04(c),
however, shall require the Administrative Agent to incur any expense or take any
action hereunder.

                  (c) Each policy of insurance obtained or maintained by any
Company shall: (i) be written by financially responsible companies selected by
Borrower and having an A.M. Best rating of "A" or better and being in a
financial size category of XII or larger, or by other companies reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent; (ii) waive all rights of subrogation of
the insurers against the Creditors; (iii) waive any right of the insurers to set
off or counterclaim or to make any other deduction, whether by way of attachment
or otherwise, as against any Creditor; (iv) waive all claims for insurance
premiums or commissions or additional premiums or assessments against the
Creditors; and (v) provide that, except in the case of third-party liability
insurance, the proceeds of any loss affecting any Property which is Collateral
(including Real Property) or interests therein shall be applied in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (d) If at any time the area in which any Mortgaged Real
Property is located is designated (i) a "flood hazard area" on any Flood
Insurance Rate Map published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any
successor agency), Borrower shall obtain flood insurance in such total amount as
the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders may from time to time
reasonably require, and otherwise comply with the National Flood Insurance
Program as set forth in the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended
from time to time, or (ii) a "Zone 1" area, Borrower shall obtain


                                      -77-
<PAGE>


earthquake insurance in such total amount as the Administrative Agent or the
Majority Lenders may reasonably require; provided, however, that Borrower shall
not, unless required by applicable law pertaining to Borrower or any Creditor,
be required to obtain any insurance described in this Section 9.04(e) if not
available at commercially reasonable rates.

                  9.05. Limitation on Lines of Business. No Company shall
directly or indirectly engage to any material extent in any line or lines of
business activity other than the business of the type conducted by Borrower and
the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date or any business related, ancillary or
complementary thereto.

                  9.06. Limitation on Fundamental Changes, Acquisitions and
Dispositions. No Company shall, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction
or series of transactions, on or after the Closing Date, (1) merge, consolidate
or amalgamate with or into any Person (other than pursuant to the Transactions
on the Closing Date), or liquidate, wind up or dissolve itself (or suffer any
liquidation or dissolution), (2) effect any Acquisition, or (3) effect any
Disposition (or agree to do any of the foregoing). Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 9.06, each of the following shall be permitted:

         ordinary course of business;

         Documents and the incurrence of any Permitted Lien;

                  (c) the merger, consolidation, dissolution or liquidation of
         (1) any Subsidiary with or into (i) Borrower if Borrower shall be the
         continuing or surviving corporation or (ii) any Qualified Subsidiary if
         such Qualified Subsidiary shall be the continuing or surviving
         corporation, and (2) any Subsidiary that is not a Qualified Subsidiary
         with or into any other Subsidiary that is not a Qualified Subsidiary;

         thereof; provided, however, that in no event may any Company enter into
         any factoring or securitization program with respect to receivables
         other than pursuant to Section 9.06(p);

                  (g) any Disposition by Borrower or any Subsidiary for fair
         market value not to exceed $15.0 million in the aggregate in any fiscal

         applied as specified in Section 2.10(a)(iv);

                  (h) any Disposition of all of the Equity Interests of, or all

                  (v) no Company shall, in connection with any such Acquisition,
         assume or remain liable with respect to any Indebtedness or other
         liability (including any tax or ERISA liability) of the related seller,
         except (1) to the extent permitted under Section 9.08 and, if after

         venture so long as after giving effect thereto Borrower shall be in
         compliance with Section 9.05 and the aggregate amount thereof
         outstanding at any time (without giving effect to any write-downs or
         write-offs thereof, but net of any cash returns of capital, cash
         dividends and cash distributions received in respect thereof) does not
         exceed $7.5 million;

                  (u) in addition to the foregoing, other Investments by
         Borrower or any Subsidiary not exceeding in the aggregate outstanding

         cash distributions received in respect thereof) $7.5 million; and

                  (v) any Investment which, in the good faith judgment of such

                  No Company shall, directly or indirectly, create or acquire
any Subsidiary without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the

         Borrower or any Subsidiary to the extent made pro rata to all holders
         of Equity Interests thereof; and

                  (b) so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing or
         would arise therefrom, Borrower may make Dividend Payments to Holdings
         if the proceeds thereof are used at the time of such Dividend Payment
         by Holdings (and Holdings may use such Dividend Payments by Borrower as
         set forth below):

                           (i) to pay out-of-pocket expenses, for
                  administrative, legal and accounting services provided by

                           (ii) to redeem Equity Interests (other than
                  Disqualified Capital Stock) held by current or former
                  employees, directors or consultants of any Company (or their
                  estates or beneficiaries of their estates); provided, however,
                  that the aggregate cash consideration paid, or distributions
                  made, pursuant to this clause (b)(ii) shall not exceed $15.0
                  million in the aggregate since the Closing Date, plus, in each

                  redemption; and

                           (iii) to fund a portion of the Transactions on the

shortfall may be added to the amount of Capital Expenditures permitted for the
immediately succeeding (but not any other) fiscal year and (y) in determining
whether any amount is available for carryover, the amount expended in any fiscal
year shall first be deemed to be from the amount allocated to such year before
any carryover.

                  9.12. Pledge or Mortgage of Additional Collateral. Promptly,
and in any event within 30 days, after the acquisition of any Property (other
than Real Property) of the type that would have constituted Collateral at the
Closing Date (including the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary hereafter created
or acquired owned directly by Borrower or any Qualified Subsidiary) (the
"Additional Collateral") and after the creation or acquisition of any Wholly
Owned Subsidiary or other Subsidiary (so long as such creation or acquisition is
by Borrower or any Qualified Subsidiary), each Obligor shall take all action
reasonably necessary or desirable, if any, including the execution and delivery
of all such agreements, assignments, documents, registers and instruments
(including amendments to the Credit Documents) and the filing of appropriate
financing statements or other documents under the provisions of the UCC or
applicable requirements of any Governmental Authority in each of the offices
where such filing is necessary or appropriate, and the delivery of appropriate
equity certificates or control agreements, to grant (in the reasonable judgment
of the Collateral Agent or the Majority Lenders) to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Creditors a duly perfected first priority Lien on such Property
pursuant to the appropriate Security Documents subject to Liens permitted under
Section 9.07(g) or (h); provided, however, that not more than 65% of the capital
stock of any Foreign Subsidiary (limited to "first-tier" Foreign Subsidiaries)
need be pledged. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph
shall not apply to any Receivables Co. or any Equity Interest therein, so long
as any Permitted Receivables Transaction with respect thereto is in effect.

                  In the event that, after the Closing Date, any Obligor
(including any Qualified Subsidiary created or acquired on or after the Closing
Date) acquires or holds a fee interest with a market or book value of $1.0
million or more in any Real Property, such Obligor shall promptly and in any
event within 90 days of the date of acquisition of such Real Property by any
Obligor (i) take such actions and execute such documents as the Collateral Agent
shall reasonably require to confirm the Lien of an existing Mortgage, if
applicable, or to create a new Mortgage on such additional Real Property in
favor of the Collateral Agent and (ii) cause to be delivered to the Collateral
Agent, on behalf of the Creditors, the documents and instruments reasonably
requested by the Collateral Agent, including, without limitation, the following
items:


                                      -89-
<PAGE>


         (a) a Mortgage in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the
Creditors, duly executed and acknowledged by each Obligor that is the owner of
or holder of any interest in such Mortgaged Real Property, and otherwise in form
for recording in the recording office of each political subdivision where each
such Mortgaged Real Property is situated, together with such certificates,
affidavits, questionnaires or returns as shall be required in connection with
the recording or filing thereof to create a Lien under applicable law, and such
UCC financing statements, all of which shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, and any other instruments necessary to
grant a mortgage lien under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction;

         (b) with respect to each Mortgaged Real Property, such consents,
approvals, amendments, supplements, estoppels, tenant subordination agreements
or other instruments as shall reasonably be deemed necessary by the Collateral
Agent in order for the owner or holder of the fee interest constituting such
Mortgaged Real Property to grant the Lien contemplated by the Mortgage with
respect to such Mortgaged Real Property;

         (c) with respect to each Mortgage, a policy (or commitment to issue a
policy) of title insurance insuring (or committing to insure) the Lien of such
Mortgage as a valid first mortgage Lien on the Mortgaged Real Property and
fixtures described therein in the amount of 115% of the fair market value of
such Mortgaged Real Property which policies (or commitments) (each, a "Title
Policy") shall (A) be issued by the Title Company, (B) to the extent necessary,
include such reinsurance arrangements (with provisions for direct access, if
necessary) as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent, (C)
contain a "tie-in" or "cluster" endorsement (if available under applicable law)
(i.e., policies which insure against losses regardless of location or allocated
value of the insured property up to a stated maximum coverage amount), (D) have
been supplemented by such endorsements (or where such endorsements are not
available, opinions of special counsel, architects or other professionals
reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent to the extent that such opinions
can be obtained at a cost which is reasonable with respect to the value of the
Mortgaged Real Property subject to such Mortgage) as shall be reasonably
requested by the Collateral Agent (including, without limitation, endorsements
on matters relating to usury, first loss, last dollar, zoning, contiguity,
revolving credit, doing business, non-imputation, public road access, survey,
variable rate, environmental lien, separate tax lot, subdivision, lender
non-imputation and so-called comprehensive coverage over covenants and
restrictions), and (E) contain no exceptions to title other than exceptions
reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent;

         (d) with respect to each Mortgaged Real Property, such affidavits,
certificates, information (including financial data) and instruments of
indemnification (including, without limitation, a so-called "gap"
indemnification) as shall be required to induce the Title Company to issue the
Title Policy/ies (or commitment) and endorsements contemplated in subparagraph
(c) above;

         (e) evidence reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent of payment
by Borrower of all Title Policy premiums, search and examination charges, and
related charges, mortgage recording taxes, fees, charges, costs and expenses
required for the recording of the Mortgages and issuance of the Title Policies
referred to subparagraph (c) above;

         (f) with respect to each Mortgaged Real Property, copies of all Leases
in which Borrower or any Subsidiary holds the lessor's interest or other
agreements relating to possessory interests, if any; such agreement shall be
subordinate to the Lien of the Mortgage to be recorded against such Mortgaged
Real Property, either expressly by its terms or pursuant to a


                                      -90-
<PAGE>


subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement, and shall otherwise be
acceptable to the Collateral Agent;

                  (g) with respect to each Mortgaged Real Property, Borrower and
         each of its Subsidiaries shall have made all notifications,
         registrations and filings, to the extent required by, and in accordance
         with, all Governmental Real Property Disclosure Requirements applicable
         to such Mortgaged Real Property;

                  (h) Surveys with respect to each Mortgaged Real Property; and

                  (i) with respect to each Mortgage and Mortgaged Real Property,
         a legal opinion from counsel licensed in the state in which the
         Mortgaged Real Property is located in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to Collateral Agent.

If requested by the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders, Borrower shall
obtain at its sole expense and as soon as practicable but in any event not later
than 45 days after request therefor, Phase 1 environmental reports from an
environmental engineering firm reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent
with respect to any Real Property owned by any Company if not delivered on or
prior to the Closing Date.

                  The costs of all actions taken by the parties in connection
with the pledge of Additional Collateral or in connection with any Mortgage,
including reasonable costs of counsel for the Agents, shall be paid by the
Obligors promptly following written demand.

                  9.13. Security Interests; Further Assurances. Each Obligor
shall, promptly, upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent or any
Lender, at Borrower's expense, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause the
execution, acknowledgment and delivery of, and thereafter register, file or
record, or cause to be registered, filed or recorded, in an appropriate
governmental office, any document or instrument supplemental to or confirmatory
of the Security Documents or otherwise deemed by the Collateral Agent reasonably
necessary or desirable for the continued validity, perfection and priority of
the Liens on the Collateral covered thereby, or obtain any consents, including,
without limitation, landlord or similar lien waivers and consents, as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection therewith.

                  Each Obligor shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Collateral Agent from time to time such other documentation, consents,
authorizations, approvals and orders in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent as the Collateral Agent shall reasonably
deem necessary to perfect or maintain the Liens on the Collateral.

                  If any Lender determines in good faith that it is required by
any Governmental Authority or any Requirement of Law to obtain appraisals as to
the market value of any Real Property constituting Collateral, Borrower shall
obtain such appraisals as soon as practicable but in any event not less than 60
days after request therefor, at the sole cost and expense of Borrower and in
conformity with the requirements of such Governmental Authority and all
Requirements of Law, as from time to time in effect.

                  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, Borrower will obtain
and deliver to the Administrative Agent appraisal reports in form and substance
and from appraisers satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, stating (a) the
then current fair market, orderly liquidation and forced liquidation values of
all or any portion of the


                                      -91-
<PAGE>


equipment or real estate owned by any Company and (b) the then current business
value of each Company. All such appraisals shall be conducted and made at the
reasonable expense of Borrower.

                  Upon the exercise by any Agent or the Lenders of any power,
right, privilege or remedy pursuant to any Credit Document which requires any
consent, approval, registration, qualification or authorization of any
Governmental Authority, each Obligor shall execute and deliver all applications,
certifications, instruments and other documents and papers that the Agents or
the Lenders may be so required to obtain.

                  9.14. Compliance with Environmental Laws. (a) Each Company
shall comply with all Environmental Laws, and will keep or cause all Property to
be kept free of any Liens under Environmental Laws, unless failure to do so
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect or subject any Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender to any
material risk of damages or liability; (b) in the event of the presence of any
Hazardous Material at, on, under, within or emanating from any Real Property
which would reasonably be expected to result in liability under or a violation
of any Environmental Law, in each case which could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, each Company
shall undertake, and/or use their best efforts to cause any of their respective
tenants or occupants to undertake, at no expense to any Lender, any action
required pursuant to Environmental Laws to mitigate and eliminate such adverse
effect; provided, however, that no Company shall be required to comply with any
order or directive of a Governmental Authority which is being contested in good
faith and by proper proceedings so long as it has maintained adequate reserves
with respect to such compliance to the extent required in accordance with GAAP;
(c) each Company shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the
occurrence of any event specified in clause (b) of this Section 9.14 and shall
periodically thereafter keep the Administrative Agent informed of any material
actions taken in response to such event and the results of such actions; and (d)
at the written request of the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to
time, each Obligor will provide, at such Obligor's sole cost and expense, an
environmental site assessment (including, without limitation, the results of any
soil or groundwater or other testing, conducted if the Administrative Agent
directs that such testing be conducted) concerning any Real Property now or
hereafter owned, leased or operated by any Company, conducted by an
environmental consulting firm proposed by such Obligor and approved by the
Administrative Agent indicating the presence or absence of Hazardous Materials
and the potential cost of any required investigation or other response or any
corrective action in connection with any Hazardous Materials on, at, under,
within or emanating from such Real Property and the potential cost of any
required investigation, response or corrective action to address any such
Hazardous Materials; provided, however, that such request may be made only if
(a) there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default, (b) the
Administrative Agent reasonably believes that any Company or any such Real
Property or operations are not in material compliance with Environmental Law or
(c) circumstances exist that reasonably could be expected to form the basis of
an Environmental Claim against such Company or any such Real Property or result
in material expenditures by any Company, in each case which could, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. If any Obligor fails to
provide the same within 60 days after such request was made, the Administrative
Agent may but is under no obligation to conduct the same, and such Obligor shall
grant and hereby grants to the Administrative Agent and its agents access to
such Real Property and specifically grants the Administrative Agent an
irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject to the rights of tenants, to
undertake such an assessment, all at such Obligor's sole cost and expense.

                  9.15. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. No Company
shall, directly or indirectly, enter into or permit to exist any transaction
(including, without limitation, the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
Property, the rendering of any service, or a merger or consolidation) with or
for the benefit of any Affiliate (an "Affiliate Transaction") unless such
Affiliate Transaction is (i) otherwise not prohibited under this Agreement; (ii)
in the ordinary course of such Company's business, and (iii) on fair


                                      -92-
<PAGE>


and reasonable terms that are not less favorable to such Company than those that
are reasonably obtainable at the time in an arm's-length transaction with a
Person that is not such an Affiliate; provided, however, that, other than with
respect to clauses (b), (d) or (f) of this Section 9.15, so long as no Default
under Section 10(a), (e), (f), (g) or (j) or Section 10(d) arising by virtue of
a default in the performance of any obligation in Section 9.05, 9.06, 9.07,
9.08, 9.09, 9.10, 9.11, 9.15, 9.25, 9.28, 9.29 or 9.30 shall have occurred and
be continuing or would arise therefrom, the following shall be permitted: (a)
Dividend Payments permitted by Section 9.10; (b) reasonable fees and
compensation paid to, and customary indemnity and reimbursement provided on
behalf of, officers, directors and employees of any Company in the ordinary
course of business; (c) loans or advances to employees permitted by Section
9.09; (d) transactions and agreements contemplated by the Management Agreement
and, so long as the annual fees thereunder are no greater than $500,000, any
amendments thereof permitted by Section 9.17 (including any payment of accrued
fees thereunder for any prior period during which the payment thereof was not
permitted by this Section 9.15); provided, further, however, so long as any
Default under Section 10(a) has not been cured or waived, payments pursuant to
agreements (including the Management Agreement) described in clause (d) of this
Section 9.15 shall not be permitted, but shall be permitted to (and shall)
accrue thereunder on a subordinated basis until such Default is cured or waived;
(e) transactions and agreements pursuant to and payments under the Tax Sharing
Agreement and any amendments thereof permitted by Section 9.27; (f) transactions
and agreements in existence on the Closing Date and described with particularity
on Schedule 9.15 (as such agreements are in effect on the Closing Date, the
"Existing Affiliate Agreements") and the transactions pursuant to the Existing
Affiliate Agreements; (g) other transactions with the Sponsor or its Affiliates
in the ordinary course of business of the Companies or with an aggregate value
for all such transactions not to exceed $1,000,000; (h) any Permitted
Receivables Transaction; (i) payments to the Permitted Holders in connection
with the Transactions of up to $10.5 million; or (j) (i) buy-sell agreements
entered into by Holdings, KAT Holdings, L.P. and certain officers, directors,

things as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order to have such
Wholly Owned Subsidiary guarantee the Obligations in accordance with the terms
of the Credit Documents, (ii) promptly (I) execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent such amendments to the Security Documents as the
Administrative Agent deems necessary or advisable in order to grant to the
Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Creditors, a perfected first priority
security interest in the Equity Interests and debt securities of such new Wholly
Owned Subsidiary which are owned by Borrower or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary and
required to be pledged pursuant to the Security Agreement, (II) deliver to the
Collateral Agent the certificates representing such Equity Interests and debt

of Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, (III) cause such new Wholly
Owned Subsidiary to take such actions necessary or advisable to grant to the
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Creditors a perfected first priority
security interest in the collateral described in the Security Agreement with
respect to such new Wholly Owned Subsidiary (subject to Permitted Liens),
including, without limitation, the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements in such jurisdictions as may be required by the Security Agreement or

the Credit Documents, as "Designated Senior Indebtedness," as such term is
defined in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture as in effect on the Closing
Date or any Permitted Refinancing thereof, or any comparable designation that
confers upon the holders of such Indebtedness or other obligation (or any Person
acting on their behalf) the right to initiate blockage periods under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture or any other Indebtedness or other obligation of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

                  9.22. Foreign Subsidiaries' Security. If following a change in
the relevant sections of the Code or the regulations, rules, rulings, notices or
other official pronouncements issued or promulgated thereunder, counsel for
Borrower reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent does not within 30
days after a request from the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders
deliver evidence, in form and substance mutually satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and Borrower, with respect to any Foreign Subsidiary which
has not already had all of its stock pledged pursuant to the Security Agreement
that (i) a pledge of more than 65% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of capital stock of such Foreign Subsidiary entitled to vote and (ii)
the entering into by such Foreign Subsidiary of a Joinder Agreement, in any such
case could reasonably be expected to cause the undistributed earnings of such
Foreign Subsidiary as determined for Federal income tax purposes to be treated
as a deemed dividend to such Foreign Subsidiary's United States parent for
Federal income tax purposes, then in the case of a failure to deliver the
evidence described in clause (i) above, that portion of such Foreign
Subsidiary's outstanding capital stock so issued by such Foreign Subsidiary and
not theretofore pledged pursuant to the Security Agreement shall be pledged to
the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Creditors pursuant to the Security
Agreement (or another security agreement in substantially similar form, if
needed), and in the case of a failure to deliver the evidence described in
clause (ii) above, such Foreign Subsidiary shall execute and deliver a Joinder
Agreement, guaranteeing the Obligations of Borrower under the Credit Documents
and granting the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Creditors a security
interest in all of such Foreign Subsidiary's assets securing the Obligations of
such Foreign Subsidiary under its Guarantee, in each case to the extent that the
entering into of such Joinder Agreement is permitted by the laws of the
respective foreign jurisdiction and with all documents delivered pursuant to
this Section 9.22 to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.

reasonably related thereto.

Equity Rights or permit any Person to own any of its Equity Interests or Equity
Rights other than Holdings or any parent or indirect parent thereof. Holdings
shall not, directly or indirectly, effect any Disposition of any Equity
Interests or Equity Rights of Borrower other than the pledge thereof pursuant to
the Security Agreement. No Company shall effect the Disposition of any Equity
Interests of any Subsidiary unless (i) all Equity Interests owned by such
Company are sold pursuant thereto in accordance with the Credit Documents, upon
which sale the Guarantee of such Subsidiary shall be automatically deemed to be
released, or (ii) an Investment in an amount equal to the fair market value of
the remaining Equity Interests owned by such Company in such Subsidiary after
giving effect to such Disposition would have been permitted to be made at such
time pursuant to Section 9.09 (at the time of such sale an Investment shall be
deemed made in such Subsidiary in an amount equal to the fair market value of
such Equity Interests).

         interest,


                                      -95-
<PAGE>


         but only to the extent permitted under Section 9.10 and the
         subordination provisions, if any, applicable thereto, (2) any Permitted
         Refinancing thereof effected in accordance with this Agreement and (3)
         the conversion or exchange of any Indebtedness into shares of common
         Equity Interests of Holdings; or

                  (b) amend, supplement, waive or otherwise modify any of the
         provisions of any Subordinated Debt (or any Permitted Refinancing of
         any thereof):

                           (i) which shortens the fixed maturity, or increases

                  increases the amount or shortens the time of payment of any
                  principal or premium payable whether at maturity, at a date
                  fixed for prepayment or by acceleration or otherwise of such
                  Subordinated Debt, or increases the amount of, or accelerates
                  the time of payment of, any fees payable in connection
                  therewith;

                           (ii) which relates to the affirmative or negative
                  covenants, events of default, redemption or repurchase
                  provisions, or remedies under the documents or instruments
                  evidencing any such Indebtedness and the effect of which is to
                  subject any Company to any more onerous or more restrictive
                  provisions taken as a whole; or

                           (iii) which otherwise materially adversely affects
                  the interests of the Lenders as senior creditors or the
                  interests of the Lenders under this Agreement or any other
                  Credit Document in any respect.

         during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason
         of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect;

                  (o) The subordination provisions relating to any Subordinated
         Debt (the "Subordination Provisions") shall fail in any material
         respect to be enforceable by the Lenders (which have not effectively
         waived the benefits thereof) in accordance with the terms thereof, or
         any


                                      -99-
<PAGE>


         Obligation shall fail to constitute Senior Debt or any similar or
         comparable designation (as defined in any Subordinated Debt), or any
         Obligor shall, directly or indirectly, disavow or contest in any manner
         any of the Subordination Provisions; or

                  (p) Any event or circumstance shall occur which permits or
         requires the persons purchasing, or financing the purchase of, Accounts
         under a Permitted Receivables Transaction (the Indebtedness or
         obligations under which aggregates to $5.0 million or more) to stop so
         purchasing or financing such Accounts, other than by reason of the
         occurrence of the stated expiry date of such Permitted Receivables
         Transaction, the operation of "clean down" provisions thereof or the
         voluntary termination thereof by any Company; provided that (A) any
         notices or cure periods that are conditions to the rights of such
         Persons to stop purchasing, or financing the purchase of, such Accounts
         have been given or have expired, as the case may be and (B) such event
         or circumstance is not cured or waived or otherwise ceases to exist
         (other than by termination of the relevant Permitted Receivables
         Transaction) by the 45th day after the later of the occurrence of such
         event or circumstance or the date of the giving of such notice and the
         end of such cure period;

THEREUPON: (1) in the case of an Event of Default other than one referred to in
clause (f) (other than clause (vi) thereof) or (g) with respect to Borrower of
this Section 10, the Administrative Agent may, and upon written direction of the
Majority Lenders shall, by notice to Borrower, terminate the Commitments and/or
declare the principal amount then outstanding of, and the accrued interest on,
the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and all other amounts payable by
Borrower hereunder and under the Notes (including any amounts payable under
Section 5.05 or 5.06) to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon such amounts
shall be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or
other formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
Borrower, reduce any claim to judgment, take any other action permitted by law
and/or take any action permitted to be taken by the Security Documents during
the existence of an Event of Default; and (2) in the case of the occurrence of
an Event of Default referred to in clause (f) (other than clause (vi) thereof)
or (g) of this Section 10 with respect to Borrower, the Commitments shall
automatically be terminated and the principal amount then outstanding of, and
the accrued interest on, the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and all other
amounts payable by Borrower hereunder and under the Notes (including any amounts
payable under Section 5.05 or 5.06) shall automatically become immediately due
and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

                  In addition, Borrower agrees, upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default if the Administrative Agent has declared
the principal amount then outstanding of, and accrued interest on, the Revolving
Credit Loans, and all other amounts payable to the Revolving Credit Lenders
hereunder and under the Notes evidencing such Loans to be due and payable, it
may and shall, if requested by the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders through the
Administrative Agent (and, in the case of any Event of Default referred to in
clause (f) (other than clause (vi) thereof) or (g) of this Section 10 with
respect to Borrower, forthwith, without any demand or the taking of any other
action by the Administrative Agent or such Lenders) provide cover for the Letter
of Credit Liabilities by paying to the Collateral Agent immediately available
funds in an amount equal to the then aggregate undrawn face amount of all
Letters of Credit, which funds shall be held by the Collateral Agent in the LC
Sub-Account subject to withdrawal only as provided in Section 12.

                  Section 11. The Agents.

                  11.01. General Provisions. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing
Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent as its agent in each such capacity and authorizes the Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to


                                     -100-
<PAGE>


exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent by the terms hereof and the Security Documents, together with
such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent agree to give promptly to each Lender a copy of
each notice or other document received by it pursuant to any Credit Document
(other than any that are required to be delivered to the Lenders by any
Obligor).

                  The Lender or other financial institution serving as any Agent
or Issuing Lender hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not such Agent or Issuing Lender, and such bank and its Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business
with any Company or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not such Agent or
Issuing Lender hereunder.

                  No Agent or Issuing Lender shall have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent or Issuing Lender shall be subject to
any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent or Issuing Lender shall have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that such Agent or
Issuing Lender is required to exercise in writing by the Majority Lenders (or
such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 13.04), and (c) except as expressly set
forth herein, no Agent or Issuing Lender shall have any duty to disclose, and
shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any
Company that is communicated to or obtained by the financial institution serving
as such Agent or Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. No
Agent or Issuing Lender shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 13.04) or in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any
Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to
the Administrative Agent and such Agent by Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent or
Issuing Lender shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire
into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with
this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any
certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or under any other
Credit Document or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance
of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth
herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document or any other agreement, instrument or
document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 7 or
elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to
be delivered to such Agent.

                  Each Agent and Issuing Lender shall be entitled to rely upon,
and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each
Agent and Issuing Lender also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or
by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent and Issuing Lender may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent and Issuing Lender may deem and
treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a
written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with such Agent or Issuing Lender. Each Agent and Issuing Lender shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement
or any other Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of the Majority Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all
Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may


                                     -101-
<PAGE>


be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action (it
being understood that this provision shall not release the Administrative Agent
from performing any action with respect to Borrower expressly required to be
performed by it pursuant to the terms hereof) under this Agreement. Each Agent
and Issuing Lender shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents in
accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders (or, if so specified by this
Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of
the Loans.

                  Each Agent and Issuing Lender may perform any and all its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more
sub-agents appointed by such Agent or Issuing Lender and reasonably acceptable
to Borrower. Each Agent, Issuing Lender and any such sub-agent may perform any
and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors ("Related
Parties"). The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to
any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and Issuing Lender
and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as
well as activities of such Agent or Issuing Lender.

                  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent
as provided in this paragraph, any Agent may resign at any time by notifying the
Lenders, the Issuing Lender (with respect to the Administrative Agent only) and
Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right
to appoint a successor which, so long as no Event of Default is continuing,
shall be reasonably acceptable to Borrower. If no successor shall have been so
appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint
a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or
an Affiliate of any such bank which, so long as no Event of Default is
continuing, shall be reasonably acceptable to Borrower. Upon the acceptance of
its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed
to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. The fees payable by Borrower to a successor Agent shall
be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between
Borrower and such successor. After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Section 11 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect
of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting
as such Agent.

                  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent, Issuing Lender or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent,
Issuing Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information
as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own
decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. No Agent or
Issuing Lender shall be deemed a trustee or other fiduciary on behalf of any
party.

                  11.02. Indemnification. Each Lender agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Agent and the Issuing Lender (to the extent not reimbursed
under Section 13.03, but without limiting the obligations of Borrower under
Section 13.03), ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the
respective Commitments of and/or Loans and Reimbursement Obligations held by the
Lenders (or, if all of the Commitments shall have been terminated or expired,
ratably in accordance with the aggregate outstanding amount of the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations held by the Lenders), for any and all


                                     -102-
<PAGE>


liabilities (including, without limitation, pursuant to any Environmental Law),
obligations, losses, damages, fines, penalties, actions, judgments,
deficiencies, suits, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and
experts' fees) or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent or Issuing Lender
(including by any Lender) arising out of or by reason of any investigation in or
in any way relating to or arising out of any Credit Document or any other
documents contemplated by or referred to therein for any action taken or omitted
to be taken by such Agent or Issuing Lender under or in respect of any of the
Credit Documents or other such documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby (including the costs and expenses that Borrower is obligated to pay
under Section 13.03, but excluding, unless a Default has occurred and is
continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance
of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
thereof or of any such other documents; provided, however, that no Lender shall
be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they are determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted
from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the party to be
indemnified. The agreements set forth in this Section 11.02 shall survive the
payment of all Loans and other obligations hereunder and shall be in addition to
and not in lieu of any other indemnification agreements contained in any other
Credit Document.

                  11.03. Consents Under Other Credit Documents. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, the
Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Majority Lenders (but
not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of
the other Credit Documents.

                  11.04. Assistance by Lenders. Each of the Lenders shall
provide full assistance and cooperation to the Agents and each Lender hereby
grants express and exclusive foreclosing and mortgage enforcement authority to
the Collateral Agent with respect to the Collateral.

                  11.05. Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents. The
Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents shall not have any right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement (or any other
Credit Document) other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents shall
not have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any other Lender.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on the
Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents in deciding to enter into this
Agreement and each other Credit Document to which it is a party or in taking or
not taking action hereunder or thereunder.

                  Section 12. Collateral Account; Application of Collateral
Proceeds.

                  12.01. Collateral Account.(a) (a) The Collateral Agent is
hereby authorized to establish and maintain at its office at 425 Lexington
Avenue, New York, New York 10017, or at such other location in the State of New
York as the Collateral Agent shall choose, in the name of the Collateral Agent
and pursuant to a Control Agreement, a restricted deposit sub-account designated
"Atrium Companies Collateral Account" (the "Collateral Account"). Each Obligor
shall deposit into the Collateral Account from time to time (i) the Net
Available Proceeds of any Casualty Event or Disposition Event with respect to
Collateral, to the extent contemplated herein or in any other Credit Document,
and (ii) any cash such Obligor is required to pledge as additional collateral
security hereunder pursuant to the Credit Documents.

                  (a) The balance from time to time in the Collateral Account
shall constitute part of the Collateral and shall not constitute payment of the
Obligations until applied as hereinafter provided. So long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing or will result therefrom, the Collateral
Agent shall within one Business Day of receiving a request of the applicable
Obligor for release of cash proceeds (i) from the Collateral Account
constituting Net Available Proceeds relating to any Casualty



                                     -103-
<PAGE>

Account to or upon the order of such Obligor, so long as such Obligor has
satisfied the conditions relating thereto set forth in Section 12.02 and (ii)
with respect to the LC Sub-Account, remit such cash on deposit in the LC
Sub-Account to or upon the order of such Obligor (x) at such time as all Letters
of Credit shall have been terminated and all of the liabilities in respect of
the Letters of Credit have been paid in full or (y)in the case of amounts
deposited pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 10, within one Business Day
after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. At any time following the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral
Agent may (and, if instructed by the Majority Lenders as specified herein,
shall) in its (or their) discretion apply or cause to be applied (subject to
collection) the balance from time to time outstanding to the credit of the
Collateral Account to the payment of the Obligations in the manner specified in
Section 12.03 hereof subject, however, in the case of amounts deposited in the
LC Sub-Account, to the provisions of clause (y) of the preceding sentence and
Section 12.03. The Obligors shall have no right to withdraw, transfer or
otherwise receive any funds deposited in the Collateral Account except to the
extent specifically provided herein.

                  (b) Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be
invested and reinvested from time to time in Permitted Investments as the
applicable Obligor (or, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, the Collateral Agent) shall determine by written instruction
to the Collateral Agent, or if no such instructions are given, then as the
Collateral Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine which Permitted
Investments shall be held in the name and be under the control of the Collateral
Agent (or any sub-agent); provided that at any time after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may (and, if
instructed by the Majority Lenders as specified herein, shall) in its (or their)
discretion at any time and from time to time elect to liquidate any such
Permitted Investments and to apply or cause to be applied the proceeds thereof
to the payment of the Obligations in the manner specified in Section 12.03
hereof subject, however, in the case of amounts deposited in the LC Sub-Account,
to the provisions of Section 12.01(b).

                  (c) Amounts deposited into the Collateral Account as cover for
Letter of Credit Liabilities under any provision of this Agreement requiring
such cover shall be held by the Collateral Agent in a separate sub-account
designated as the "LC Sub-Account" (the "LC Sub-Account") and all amounts held
in the LC Sub-Account shall constitute collateral security first for Letter of
Credit Liabilities outstanding from time to time and second for the other
Obligations hereunder (x) until such time as all Letters of Credit shall have
been terminated and all of the liabilities in respect of Letters of Credit have
been paid in full or (y) or in the case of amounts deposited pursuant to the
last paragraph of Section 10, until three Business Days after all Events of
Default have been cured or waived.

                  12.02. Proceeds of Destruction, Taking and Collateral
Dispositions. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, in the event the applicable Obligor elects to reinvest Net Available
Proceeds in respect of any Casualty Event or Disposition Event in accordance
with the provisions of Sections 2.10(a)(i) and 2.10(a)(iv) as applicable, the
Collateral Agent shall receive at least 5 Business Days' prior notice of each
request for payment and shall not release any part of such Net Available
Proceeds, until the applicable Obligor has furnished to the Collateral Agent (i)
an Officer's Certificate setting forth: (A) a brief description of the
reinvestment to be made, (B) the dollar amount of the expenditures to be made,
or costs incurred by such Obligor in connection with such reinvestment and (C)
that the properties acquired in connection with such reinvestment have a fair
market value at least equal to the amount of such Net Available Proceeds
requested to be released from the Collateral Account and (ii) all security
agreements and Mortgages and other items required by the provisions of Sections
9.12, 9.13 and 9.20, if applicable, to, among other things, subject such
reinvestment properties to the Lien of the Security Documents in favor of the
Collateral Agent, for its benefit and for the benefit of the other Creditors.

                  12.03. Application of Proceeds. The proceeds received by the
Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from or other realization
upon all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the exercise by the
Collateral Agent of its remedies shall be applied, in full or in part, together
with any other sums then held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this
Agreement, promptly by the Collateral Agent as follows:

                  (a) First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and
         expenses, fees, commissions and taxes of such sale, collection or other
         realization including compensation to the Collateral Agent and its
         agents and counsel, and all reasonable expenses, liabilities and
         advances made or incurred by the Collateral Agent in connection
         therewith and all amounts for which the Collateral Agent is entitled to
         indemnification pursuant to the provisions of any Credit Document,
         together with interest on each such amount at the highest rate then in
         effect under this Agreement from and after the date such amount is due,
         owing or unpaid until paid in full;

                  (b) Second, to the payment of all other reasonable costs and
         expenses of such sale, collection or other realization including
         compensation to the other Creditors and their agents and counsel and
         all reasonable costs, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the
         other Creditors in connection therewith, in each case, equally and
         ratably in accordance with the respective amounts thereof then due and
         owing, together with interest on each such amount at the highest rate
         then in effect under this Agreement from and after the date such amount
         is due, owing or unpaid until paid in full;

                  (c) Third, without duplication of amounts applied pursuant to
         clauses (a) and (b) above, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash,
         pro rata, of interest and other amounts constituting Obligations (other
         than principal) in each case equally and ratably in accordance with the
         respective amounts thereof then due and owing;

                  (d) Fourth, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash, pro
         rata, of principal amount of the Obligations; and

                  (e) Fifth, the balance, if any, to the person lawfully
         entitled thereto (including the applicable Obligor or its successors or
         assigns) or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

                  In the event that any such proceeds are insufficient to pay in
full the items described in clauses (a) through (e) of this Section 12.03, the
Obligors shall remain liable, jointly and severally, for any deficiency.

                  Section 13. Miscellaneous.

                  13.01. Waiver. No failure on the part of any Creditor to
exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to,
any right, power or privilege under any Credit Document shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege under any Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies
provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by
law.

                  13.02. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications

jointly and severally, agree to pay or reimburse:

                  (b) The Obligors, jointly and severally, hereby agree to
indemnify each Creditor and their respective Affiliates, directors, trustees,
investment advisors, officers, employees and agents (each, an "Indemnitee")
from, and hold each of them harmless against, and that no Indemnitee will have
any liability for, any and all Losses incurred by any of them (including any and
all Losses incurred by any Agent, the Lead Arrangers or the Issuing Lender to
any Lender, whether or not any Creditor is a party thereto) directly or
indirectly arising out of or by reason of or relating to the negotiation,
execution, delivery, performance, administration or enforcement of any Credit
Document, any of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents, any
breach by any Obligor of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in any of the Credit Documents in connection with any of the
Transactions, the use or proposed use of any of the Loans or Letters of Credit,
the issuance of or performance under any Letter of Credit or the use of any
collateral security for the Loans (including the exercise by any Creditor of the
rights and remedies or any power of attorney with respect thereto and any action
or inaction in respect thereof), but excluding (i) any such Losses to the extent
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
nonappealable judgment to have arisen primarily from the gross negligence or bad
faith of the Indemnitee and (ii) claims among the Agents and the Lenders other
than to the extent arising out of or as a result of any direct or indirect act
or omission of any Obligor or any Affiliate, director, officer, employee or
agent thereof.

                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Obligors, jointly and severally, will indemnify each Creditor and each other


                                     -106-
<PAGE>

Indemnitee from, and hold each Creditor and each other Indemnitee harmless
against, any Losses described in the preceding sentence arising under any
Environmental Law as a result of (A) the past, present or future operations of
any Company (or any predecessor in interest to any Company), (B) the past,
present or future condition of any site or facility owned, operated, leased or
used at any time by any Company (or any such predecessor in interest), or (C)
any Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous Materials at, on, under,
within or emanating from any such site or facility, including any such Release
or threatened Release that shall occur during any period when any Creditor shall
be in possession of any such site or facility following the exercise by such
Creditor of any of its rights and remedies hereunder or under any of the
Security Documents (except to the extent such Release or threatened Release is
caused by the actions of such Creditor); provided, however, that the indemnity
hereunder shall be subject to the exclusions from indemnification set forth in
the preceding paragraph.

                  To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify and hold
harmless set forth in this Section 13.03 or any other provision of any Credit
Document providing for indemnification is unenforceable because it is violative
of any law or public policy or otherwise, the Obligors, jointly and severally,
shall contribute the maximum portion that each of them is permitted to pay and
satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all indemnified
liabilities incurred by any of the Persons indemnified hereunder.

                  The Obligors also agree that no Indemnitee shall have any
liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) for any
Losses to any Obligor or any Obligor's security holders or creditors resulting
from, arising out of, in any way related to or by reason of any matter referred
to in any indemnification or expense reimbursement provisions set forth in this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, except to the extent that any Loss is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable
judgment to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence or bad faith of
such Indemnitee.

                  The Obligors agree that, without the prior written consent of
the Agents, the Lead Arrangers and the Majority Lenders which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, no Obligor will settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of
which indemnification is reasonably likely to be sought under the
indemnification provisions of this Section 13.03 (whether or not any Indemnitee
is an actual or potential party to such Proceeding), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional written release of each
Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Proceeding and does not
include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act
by or on behalf of any Indemnitee and does not involve any payment of money or
other value by any Indemnitee or any injunctive relief or factual findings or
stipulations binding on any Indemnitee.

13.04. Amendments, Etc. (i) No provision of any Credit Document may be amended,
modified or supplemented except by an instrument in writing signed by the
Obligors party thereto and the Majority Lenders, or by the Obligors party
thereto and the Administrative Agent acting with the written consent of the
Majority Lenders, and no provision of any Credit Document may be waived except
by an instrument in writing signed by the Obligors party thereto and the
Majority Lenders, or by the Obligors party thereto and the Administrative Agent
acting with the written consent of the Majority Lenders; provided, however,
that:

                  (a) no amendment or waiver shall, unless by an instrument
         signed by all of the Lenders or by the Administrative Agent acting with
         the written consent of each Lender (or, in the case of clauses (I),
         (II), (III) or (IV), only such Lenders with Obligations directly
         affected (it being understood that the consent of no other Lender or
         Agent is needed in each such case)): (I) other than as provided for in
         this Agreement, extend the scheduled final maturity of any Loan


                                     -107-

         or Note held by such Lenders, or extend the stated expiration date of
         any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination
         Date, or reduce the rate of interest (other than any waiver of any
         increase in the interest rate applicable to any of the Loans held by
         such Lenders pursuant to clause (b) of Section 3.02) or fees thereon,
         or extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon (other than
         in connection with the extension of any scheduled payment hereunder
         otherwise permitted hereby), or forgive or reduce the principal amount
         or the amount due and owing thereof or any other amount due and owing
         under any Credit Document, or make any change to the definition of
         Applicable Margin or Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage, (II)
         extend the final maturity of any of the Commitments (or reinstate any
         Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 10) of such Lenders, (III)

         payable, (IV) amend the terms of this Section 13.04 or Section 4.02,
         4.07, 5, 11.03 or 12.03, (V) reduce the percentages specified in the
         definition of the term "Majority Lenders" or amend any provision of any
         Credit Document requiring the consent of all the Lenders or reduce any
         other percentage of the Lenders required to make any determinations or
         waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof (it being
         understood that, with the consent of the Majority Lenders, additional
         extensions of credit or commitments for the extension of credit
         pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of the
         Majority Lenders without notice to or consent of any other Lender or
         Agent on substantially the same basis as the Commitments (and related
         extensions of credit) are included on the Closing Date), (VI) release
         any Guarantor from its obligations under Section 6 (unless permitted by
         this Agreement, including, without limitation, clause (d) of this
         proviso to this Section 13.04(i)), (VII) consent to the assignment or
         transfer by any Obligor of any of its rights and obligations under any
         Credit Document, (VIII) release all or substantially all the Collateral
         or terminate the Lien under any Credit Document in respect of all or
         substantially all the Collateral (except as permitted by the Credit
         Documents, including, without limitation, clause (d) of this proviso to
         this Section 13.04(i)) or agree to additional obligations (other than
         the Obligations and other extensions of credit under this Agreement
         consented to by the Majority Lenders) being secured by the Collateral,
         (IX) waive the requirement that nine and twelve month LIBOR Interest
         Periods require the consent of all Lenders, or (X) amend Section 13.03
         or any other indemnification and expense reimbursement provision set
         forth in any Credit Document (it being understood that any prepayment
         required by Section 2.10(a) (and any corresponding reduction of the
         Revolving Credit Commitments), other than pursuant to Section
         2.10(a)(v), may be waived or amended by the Majority Lenders);

                  (b) no such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver
         shall increase the Commitments of any Lender over the amount thereof
         then in effect without the consent of such Lender (it being understood
         that amendments, modifications or waivers of conditions precedent,
         covenants, Defaults or Events of Default shall not constitute an
         increase of the Commitment of any Lender);

                  (c) any modification or supplement of or waiver with respect
         to Section 11 which affects any Agent in their respective capacities as
         such shall require the consent of such Agent;

                  (d) no consent of any Lender need be obtained, and the
         Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is hereby
         authorized, to release any Lien securing the Obligations on Property
         which is the subject of any Disposition permitted by the Credit
         Documents and to release any Guarantee of a Subsidiary upon the sale of
         all of the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary in accordance with the
         Credit Documents;

                  (e) subject to clause (a)(I) above of this proviso to this
         Section 13.04(i), the consent of the Majority Term Loan Lenders shall
         be required with respect to any extension of any

                                     -108-
<PAGE>


         scheduled Amortization Payment or any reduction in the amount of any
         scheduled Amortization Payment or any change to Section 3.01(b) (it
         being understood that, subject to clause (f) below of this Section
         13.04(i), any prepayment required by Section 2.10 (and any
         corresponding reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments), other
         than pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(v), may be modified, supplemented or
         waived by the Majority Lenders);

                  (f) no modification, supplement or waiver shall, unless by an
         instrument signed by the Majority Term Loan Lenders or by the
         Administrative Agent acting with the written consent of such Lenders,
         change the timing of the receipt or the order in which any such
         prepayment is applied to the Term Loans (although any required
         prepayment set forth in Section 2.10 (and any corresponding reduction
         of the Revolving Credit Commitments), other than pursuant to Section
         2.10(a)(v), may otherwise be modified, supplemented or waived by the
         Majority Lenders);

                  (g) no reduction of the percentage specified in the definition
         of "Majority Revolving Credit Lenders" or "Majority Term Loan Lenders,"
         shall be made without the consent of each Revolving Credit Lender or
         each Term Loan Lender, respectively (it being understood that, only the
         Class of such Loan to which such definition relates need consent to any
         such reduction and that with the consent of the Majority Lenders, other
         additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be
         included in any such definition without notice to or consent of any
         other Lender or Agent on substantially the same terms as the
         Commitments (and related extensions of credit) are included on the
         Closing Date);

                  (h) waive any Event of Default under Section 10(a) without the
         consent of all affected Lenders;

                  (i) no amendment or waiver shall make any change to Section
         2.01(d) or the definitions of "Swing Loan Commitment," "Swing Loan
         Maturity Date" or "Swing Loans" or the Swing Loan Note without the
         consent of the Swing Loan Lender;

                  (j) no amendment or waiver shall affect the rights or duties
         of the Issuing Lender in its capacity as such or alter the obligation
         of any Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(e) or 2.03(f)
         without the consent of the Issuing Lender;

                  (k) no consent of any Lender need be obtained to effect any
         amendment of any Credit Document necessary to comply with Section 9.12
         or Section 9.20;

                  (l) [Reserved];

                  (m) [Reserved];

                  (n) no amendment, modification, supplement or waiver may be
         made to any condition precedent to any extension of credit under the
         Revolving Credit Facility set forth in Section 7.02 without the written
         consent of the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders, it being understood
         that no amendment to or waiver of any representation or warranty or any
         covenant contained in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or
         of any Default, shall be deemed to be effective for purposes of
         determining whether the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7.02
         to the making of any extension of credit under the Revolving Credit
         Loans have been satisfied unless the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders
         shall have consented to such amendment or waiver; and


                                     -109-
<PAGE>


                  (o) any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement
         that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of
         the Revolving Credit Lenders (but not the Term Loan Lenders) or the
         Term Loan Lenders (but not the Revolving Credit Lenders) may be
         effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by
         Borrower and requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of
         Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if
         such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the
         time.

                 (ii) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver,
discharge or termination to any of the provisions of this Agreement as
contemplated by Section 13.04(i)(a) (other than clause (I) of such section), the
consent of the Majority Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more of
such other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained, then Borrower
shall have the right to replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders (so
long as all non-consenting Lenders are so replaced) with one or more Replacement
Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11 so long as at the time of such replacement each
such Replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination.

                (iii) Notwithstanding anything in Section 13.04(i) to the
contrary, this Agreement and the other Credit Documents may be amended at any
time, and from time to time, after the Closing Date and prior to the date that
is two years thereafter, to increase the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments
or to establish additional Term Loans under this Agreement, at the discretion of
Borrower and the Lead Arrangers (the "Greenshoe Option"), by an agreement in
writing entered into by Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Lead Arrangers and each Person (including any Lender) that shall
agree to provide such Commitment or make a Term Loan (and each such Person that
shall not already be a Lender shall, at the time such agreement becomes
effective, become a Lender with the same effect as if it had originally been a
Lender under this Agreement with the Commitment and/or Term Loans set forth in
such agreement); provided that (i) the aggregate principal amount of the
additional Term Loans and the new Revolving Credit Commitments established
pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed $100,000,000, (ii) no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
increase, (iii) no Commitment of any Lender shall be increased without the
consent of such Lender, (iv) if the Term Loans are increased pursuant to the
Greenshoe Option, the remaining scheduled payments set forth in Section 3.01(b)
shall be increased pro rata and (v) in the event that any upfront fee payable to
any Term Loan Lender in connection with the Greenshoe Option exceeds an amount
equal to 25 basis points on such Lender's additional commitment, Borrower will
pay existing Term Loan Lenders that are not providing an additional commitment
an amount equal to the number of basis points by which the fee payable to the
Term Loan Lender providing an additional commitment exceeds 25 basis points
multiplied by the commitment of each existing Term Loan Lender not providing an
additional commitment (it being understood that if the Greenshoe Option is sold
at a discount, such discount shall be treated as an upfront fee). The Loans and
Commitments established pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute Loans and
Commitments under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and shall, without limiting the
foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the Guarantees and security
interests created by the Security Documents.

                  13.05. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

                  13.06. Assignments and Participations. (a) No Obligor may
assign its respective rights or obligations hereunder or under the Notes or any
other Credit Document without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders.

                  (a) Each Lender may assign to any Eligible Person any of its
Loans, its Notes, its Letter of Credit Interests and its Commitments (but only
with the consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, in the case of the


                                     -110-
<PAGE>


Revolving Credit Commitments, the Issuing Lender); provided, however, that (i)
no such consent by Borrower, the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent
shall be required in the case of any assignment to another Lender or any
Lender's Affiliate or an Approved Fund of any Lender (in which case, the
assignee and assignor Lenders shall give a Notice of Assignment to Borrower and
the Administrative Agent); (ii) no consent of Borrower need be obtained prior to
the completion of the Primary Syndication or if any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing; (iii) each assignment, other than to a Lender or any
Lender's Affiliate or an Approved Fund of any Lender and other than any
assignment effected by the Lead Arrangers or any of their Affiliates in
connection with the Primary Syndication of the Commitments and/or Loans or
otherwise, shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $1.0 million unless
the assigning Lender's exposure is reduced to $0 or unless Borrower and the
Administrative Agent otherwise agree; and (iv) in no event may any such
assignment be made to any Obligor or any of its Affiliates without consent of
all Lenders. Any assignment of a Loan shall be effective only upon appropriate
entries with respect thereto being made in the Register (and each Note shall
expressly so provide). Any assignment or transfer of a Loan shall be registered
on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer
of the Note evidencing such Loan (if a Note was issued in respect thereof),
accompanied by a Notice of Assignment, and upon consent thereto by Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender to the extent required above (none
of which consents to be unreasonably withheld), one or more new Notes (if
requested by the new Lender) in the same aggregate principal amount shall be
issued to the designated assignee and the old Notes shall be returned by the
Administrative Agent to Borrower marked "cancelled." Upon execution and delivery
by the assignee to Borrower and the Administrative Agent of a Notice of
Assignment, and upon consent thereto by Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Issuing Lender to the extent required above (none of which consents to be
unreasonably withheld), and in the case of a Loan, upon appropriate entries
being made in the Register the assignee shall have, to the extent of such
assignment (unless otherwise provided in such assignment with the consent of the
Administrative Agent), the obligations, rights and benefits of a Lender
hereunder holding the Commitment(s), Loans (or portions thereof) and Letter of
Credit Interests assigned to it (in addition to the Commitment(s), Letter of
Credit Interests and Loans, if any, theretofore held by such assignee) and the
assigning Lender shall, to the extent of such assignment, be released from the
Commitment(s) (or portion(s) thereof) so assigned. The parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit N, together with a processing and
recordation fee of $3,500 (except, in the case of (i) an assignment to an
Affiliate of the assigning Lender or an Approved Fund of the assigning Lender,
the processing and recordation fee shall be $1,000 and (ii) an assignment
involving either of the Lead Arrangers, there shall be no fee required). Upon
any such assignment, certain rights and obligations of the assigning Lender
shall survive as set forth in Section 13.07. At the time of each assignment
pursuant to this Section 13.06(b) to any Eligible Person that is not already a
Lender hereunder, the respective assignee Lender shall provide to Borrower and
the Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service forms (and, if
applicable, a Section 5.06 Certificate) described in Section 5.06(b).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall be entitled to any consultation
rights granted to it by the Commitment Letter with respect to the syndication of
the Loans. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein or in any of the other Credit Documents, any assignment to an Affiliate
of the assigning Lender or to an Approved Fund of the assigning Lender shall be
effective between such Lender and its Affiliate or Approved Fund immediately
without compliance with the conditions for assignment under this Section
13.06(b), but shall not be effective with respect to Borrower, any Agent, any
Issuing Lender, the Swing Loan Lender or any Lender, and Borrower, each Agent,
each Issuing Lender, the Swing Loan Lender and each Lender shall be entitled to
deal solely and directly with such assigning Lender under any such assignment,
in each case, until the conditions for assignment under this Section 13.06(b)
have been complied with.

                  (b) A Lender may sell or agree to sell to one or more other
Eligible Persons a participation in all or any part of any Loans and Letter of
Credit Interests held by it, or in its Commitments, in which event each
purchaser of a participation (a "Participant") shall be entitled to the rights
and


                                     -111-
<PAGE>


benefits of the provisions of Section 5 (provided, however, that no Participant
shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to Section 5 than the
transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the
participation effected by such transferor Lender had no participation occurred,
except in the case of Section 5.06, where (a) the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with Borrower's prior written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld) or (b) where the entitlement to greater payments
results from a change in law after such Participant became a Participant) with
respect to its participation in such Loans, Letter of Credit Interests and
Commitments as if such Participant were a "Lender" for purposes of said Section,
but, except as otherwise provided in Section 4.07(c), shall not have any other
rights or benefits under this Agreement or any Note or any other Credit Document
(the Participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such participation
to be those set forth in the agreements executed by such Lender in favor of the
Participant). Except as otherwise expressly provided above in this Section
13.06(c), all amounts payable by Borrower to any Lender under Section 5 in
respect of Loans, Letter of Credit Interests and its Commitments shall be no
greater than the amount that would have applied if such Lender had not sold or
agreed to sell any participation in such Loans, Letter of Credit Interests and
Commitments, and as if such Lender were funding each of such Loan, Letter of
Credit Interests and Commitments in the same way that it is funding the portion
of such Loan, Letter of Credit Interests and Commitments in which no
participations have been sold. In no event shall a Lender that sells a
participation agree with the Participant to take or refrain from taking any
action hereunder or under any other Credit Document, except that such Lender may
agree with the Participant that it will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any modification or amendment set forth in subclause (I),
(II), (III) or (VIII) of clause (a) of the proviso to Section 13.04(i).

                  (c) In addition to the assignments and participations
permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.06, any Lender may
assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any United
States Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular
issued by such Federal Reserve Bank and, in the case of a Lender that is an
investment fund, any such Lender may assign or pledge all or any portion of its
Loans and its Notes to its trustee or other creditors in support of its
obligations to its trustee or such other creditors, without notice to or consent
of Borrower, the Administrative Agent, Lead Arrangers or Issuing Lender. No such
assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

                  (d) A Lender may furnish any information concerning any
Company in the possession of such Lender from time to time to assignees and
participants (including prospective assignees and participants) subject,
however, to and so long as the recipient agrees in writing to be bound by the
provisions of Section 13.11. In addition, each Agent and each Lead Arranger may
furnish any information concerning any Obligor or any of its Affiliates in such
Agent's or such Lead Arranger's possession to any Affiliate of such Agent or
such Lead Arranger, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 13.11. The
Obligors shall assist any Lender in effectuating any assignment or participation
pursuant to this Section 13.06 (including during the Primary Syndication) in
whatever manner such Lender reasonably deems necessary, including participation
in meetings with prospective transferees.

                  13.07. Survival. The obligations of the Obligors under
Sections 5.01, 5.05, 5.06 and 13.03, the obligations of each Guarantor under
Section 6.03, and the obligations of the Lenders under Sections 5.06 and 11.02,
shall survive the repayment of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations and the
termination of the Commitments and, in the case of any Lender that may assign
any interest in its Commitments, Loans or Letter of Credit Interest hereunder,
shall (to the extent relating to such time as it was a Lender) survive the
making of such assignment, notwithstanding that such assigning Lender may cease
to be a "Lender" hereunder. In addition, each representation and warranty made,
or deemed to be made by a notice of any extension of credit, herein or pursuant
hereto shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto
and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and


                                     -112-
<PAGE>


the Notes and the making of any extension of credit hereunder, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default or incorrect representation or warranty.

                  13.08. Captions. The table of contents and captions and
section headings appearing herein are included solely for convenience of
reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of
this Agreement.

                  13.09. Counterparts; Interpretation; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and
the other Credit Documents, the Fee Letter and the Incremental Fee Letter
constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof, other than the provisions of the
Commitment Letter and the Incremental Commitment Letter which by their express
terms survive the execution of this Agreement or the termination of the
Commitment Letter or the Incremental Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms of
the last paragraph thereof. Except as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement
shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative
Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof
which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties
hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                  13.10. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers;
Etc. Each Credit Document shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the principles of
conflicts of laws thereof to the extent that the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction would be required thereby (except in the case of the other
Credit Documents, to the extent otherwise expressly stated therein). Each
Obligor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (I) submits for itself and its
Property in any Proceeding relating to any Credit Document to which it is a
party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to
the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New
York sitting in New York County, the courts of the United States of America for
the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof; (II)
consents that any such Proceeding may be brought in any such court and waives
trial by jury and any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue
of any such Proceeding in any such court or that such Proceeding was brought in
an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; (III) agrees
that service of process in any such Proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy
thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of
mail), postage prepaid, to Borrower at its address set forth in Section 13.02 or
at such other address of which Administrative Agent shall have been notified
pursuant thereto; and (IV) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to
effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit
the right to sue in any other jurisdiction.

                  13.11. Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to keep
confidential information obtained by it pursuant hereto and the other Credit
Documents confidential in accordance with such Lender's customary practices for
treatment of its confidential information and agrees that it will only use such
information in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and not disclose any of such information other than (a) to such Lender's
Affiliates and its and its Affiliates' respective employees, representatives,
directors, attorneys, auditors, agents, professional advisors, trustees or
affiliates who are advised of the confidential nature of such information or to
any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements or such
contractual counterparty's professional advisor (so long as such contractual
counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to
be bound by the provision


                                     -113-
<PAGE>


of this Section 13.11), (b) to the extent such information presently is or
hereafter becomes available to such Lender on a non-confidential basis from any
source of such information that is in the public domain at the time of
disclosure, (c) to the extent disclosure is required by law (including
applicable securities laws), regulation, subpoena or judicial order or process
(provided that notice of such requirement or order shall be promptly furnished
to Borrower unless such notice is legally prohibited) or requested or required
by bank, securities, insurance or investment company regulations or auditors or
any administrative body or commission (including the Securities Valuation Office
of the NAIC) to whose jurisdiction such Lender may be subject, (d) to any rating
agency to the extent required in connection with any rating to be assigned to
such Lender, (e) to assignees or participants or prospective assignees or
participants who agree to be bound by the provisions of this Section 13.11, (f)
to the extent required in connection with any litigation between any Obligor and
any Lender with respect to the Loans or this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents or (g) with Borrower's prior written consent.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other express or implied
agreement or understanding to the contrary, any party to this Agreement (and
each Affiliate, director, officer, employee, agent or representative of the
foregoing or such Affiliate) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated herein and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating to such tax treatment or
tax structure (it being understood that this authorization is retroactively
effective to the commencement of the first discussions between or among any of
the parties hereto regarding the transactions contemplated herein). The
foregoing language is not intended to waive any confidentiality obligations
otherwise applicable under this Agreement except with respect to the information
and materials specifically referenced in the preceding sentence.
 This authorization does not extend to disclosure of any other information,
including (a) the identity of participants or potential participants in the
transactions contemplated herein, (b) the existence or status of any
negotiations, or (c) any financial, business, legal or personal information of
or regarding a party or its affiliates, or of or regarding any participants or
potential participants in the transactions contemplated herein (or any of their
respective affiliates), in each case to the extent such other information is not
related to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated
herein.

                  13.12. Independence of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants. The representations, warranties and covenants contained herein shall
be independent of each other and no exception to any representation, warranty or
covenant shall be deemed to be an exception to any other representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein unless expressly provided, nor shall any
such exception be deemed to permit any action or omission that would be in
contravention of applicable law.

                  13.13. Severability. Wherever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of
such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

                  13.14. Acknowledgments. The Obligors hereby acknowledge that:
(a) this Agreement and the other Credit Documents are the result of negotiation
and each of the Obligors has been advised by counsel in connection with the
negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents; (b) no Creditor has any fiduciary or similar relationship to any
Obligor and the relationship between the Creditors on the one hand, and the
Obligors, on the other hand, is solely that of debtor and creditor; and (c) no
joint venture exists among the Creditors or among the Obligors and the
Creditors.

                  13.15. Limitation on Interest. The Obligors, the Agents and
the Lenders intend to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury laws
from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof


                                     -114-
<PAGE>


such Persons stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained
in the Credit Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, for
the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest in excess of the maximum
amount of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law from time to time
in effect. No Obligor, endorser or other Person hereafter becoming liable for
payment of any Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest thereon or
shall ever be required to pay interest thereon in excess of the maximum amount
that may be lawfully contracted for, charged or received under applicable law
from time to time in effect, and the provisions of this section shall control
over all other provisions of the Credit Documents that may be in conflict or
apparent conflict herewith. The Agents and the Lenders expressly disavow any
intention to contract for, charge or collect excessive unearned interest or
finance charges in the event the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated. If
(a) the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated for any reason, (b) any
Obligation is prepaid and as a result any amounts held to constitute interest
are determined to be in excess of the legal maximum, or (c) an Agent or a Lender
shall otherwise collect moneys that are determined to constitute interest that
would otherwise increase the interest on any or all of the Obligations to an
amount in excess of that permitted to be charged by applicable law then in
effect, then all sums determined to constitute interest in excess of such legal
limit shall, without penalty, be promptly applied to reduce the then outstanding
principal of the related Obligations or, at the option of such Agent or such
Lender, as applicable, promptly returned to Borrower upon such determination. In
determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific
circumstance, exceeds the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, the
Agents and the Lenders and Borrower shall to the greatest extent permitted under
applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or
premium rather than as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the
effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread the total
amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of instruments
evidencing the Obligations in accordance with the amounts outstanding from time
to time thereunder and the maximum legal rate of interest from time to time in
effect under applicable law in order to lawfully contract for, charge, or
receive the maximum amount of interest permitted under applicable law. In the
event applicable law provides for an interest ceiling under Chapter 303 of the
Texas Finance Code, as amended, for that day, the ceiling shall be the "weekly
ceiling" as defined in Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended;
provided that if any applicable law permits greater interest, the law permitting
the greatest interest shall apply. As used in this section the term "applicable
law" means the laws of the State of Texas or the laws of the United States,
whichever allow the greater interest, as such laws now exist or may be changed
or amended or come into effect in the future.
