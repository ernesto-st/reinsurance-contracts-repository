I.       Article IX, REINSURANCE RESERVES, Sections 1 is hereby replaced as
         follows:

         1.       The Reinsurer will:

                  (a)      Set up Statutory Reserves and Liabilities not less
                           than the reduction taken by the Reinsured for the
                           reinsured contracts; and if greater,

                  (b)      Establish a liability ("Benefit Reserve"), for the
                           benefit of the Reinsured, not less than the excess of
                           the present value of expected future reinsured
                           benefits, less the present value of future expected
                           gross reinsurance premiums.

II.      Schedule B4, Benefit Reserve Formula and Assumptions, is hereby
         replaced as follows:

SCHEDULE B4, BENEFIT RESERVE FORMULA AND ASSUMPTIONS

BENEFIT RESERVE METHODOLOGY

The reserve calculation method is the net premium method with the reserve
calculated over a 20-year period, after which the business may be recaptured.
The terminal reserves are calculated using monthly curtate assumptions; premiums
are paid at the beginning of the month and death benefits are paid at the end of
the month. The formula for the terminal reserve is:

         tV(12) = PVt (expected future benefits) - k * PVt (expected future
         gross reinsurance premiums),

         where

         k = PVt (expected future benefits)/PVt (expected future gross
         reinsurance premiums) for t=0, and

         tV(12) is the terminal reserve at duration t.


<PAGE>

The final reserve calculation represents an exact linear interpolation between
two terminal reserves, giving the formula:

         t-1+sV(12) = t-1V(12) * (1-s) + tV(12) * s,

         where

         s is the portion of one year expired between the last policy
         anniversary and the valuation date.
