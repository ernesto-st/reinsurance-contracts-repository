(E)  Each Specified Voluntary Prepayment shall be made within five  (5)  Business Days of the Acceptance Date (or such later date as the Administrative Agent and the  Borrower shall  reasonably agree, given the time required to calculate the Applicable Discount and  determine the amount  and holders of Qualifying Loans), without premium or penalty (except as set  forth in Section 3.05),  upon irrevocable notice substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto (each  a &#8220;Specified Voluntary  Prepayment Notice&#8221;), delivered to the Administrative Agent no later than  12:00  p.m.,  Local  Time,   one  Business  Day  prior  to  the  date  of  such  Specified  Voluntary  Prepayment, which notice shall  specify the date and amount of the Specified Voluntary Prepayment  and  the  Discount  (if  any).  Upon   receipt  of  any  Specified  Voluntary  Prepayment  Notice  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly   notify  each  relevant  Lender  thereof.

For  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes,  the  parties  to this Agreement agree as follows:    (1)  The Term Loans are intended to be debt for U.S. federal   income tax purposes.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">      ARTICLE IV    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES    In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make each Loan to be made  thereby,   each  of  the  Borrower  and  Holdings  represents  and  warrants  to  each  Lender  that  each  of  the  following  statements is true and correct:    Section 4.01.  Organization and Qualification. Each of the Loan Parties is (a) duly organized  or  formed, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction  of  organization as identified on Schedule 4.01 and (b) is qualified to do business and is in good standing in  every   jurisdiction  where  its  assets  are  located  and  wherever  necessary  to  carry  out  its  business  and  operations,  except, in the case of this clause (b), in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in  good standing has  not had, and would not be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.    Section 4.02.  Due  Authorization.  The  execution,  delivery  and  performance  of  the  Loan   Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each Loan Party that is a party  thereto,  and on the part of the respective shareholders, members or other equity security holders of each  Loan Party, and each  Loan Party has all requisite power and authority to own and operate its properties, to  carry on its business as now  conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Loan Documents  to which it is a party and to carry  out the transactions contemplated thereby.    Section 4.03.  Equity Interests and Ownership; Status.    (a)  Schedule 4.03 correctly sets forth as of the Closing Date the ownership interest of    Holdings and the Subsidiaries in their respective Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.03 and as   evidenced by the Warrant Purchase Agreements, as of the Closing Date, there is no existing option, warrant,  call,   right,  commitment  or  other  agreement  to  which any  Loan Party  (other than  Holdings)  is  a  party  requiring, and  there is no membership interest or other Equity Interests of any Loan Party (other than  Holdings)  outstanding which upon conversion, exchange or exercise would require, the issuance by any  Loan Party of any  additional membership interests or other Equity Interests of any Loan Party (other than  Holdings) or other Securities  convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for or evidencing the right to  subscribe for or purchase, a membership  interest or other Equity Interests of any Loan Party (other than  Holdings), and no securities or obligations  evidencing any such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.    (b)  All the legal requirements of the Luxembourg law of 31 May 1999, as amended,   regarding the domiciliation companies have been complied with by the Borrower. The &#8220;centre of main   interests&#8221; (as that term is used in the Insolvency Regulation) of the Borrower is in the Grand Duchy of   Luxembourg, and the Borrower does not have any &#8220;establishment&#8221; (as that term is used in the Insolvency   Regulation) outside the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.    Section 4.04.  No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by the Loan Parties of the  Loan  Documents to which they are parties and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the  Loan Documents  do not and shall not (a) violate (i) any provision of any law, statute, ordinance, rule,  regulation, or code  applicable to any Loan Party, (ii) any of the Organizational Documents of any Loan  Party or (iii) any order,  judgment, injunction or decree of any court or other agency of government binding  on any Loan Party; (b)  conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or  both) a default under any  Contractual Obligation of any Loan Party except to the extent such conflict, breach  or default would not reasonably  be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (c) result in or require the  creation or imposition of any Lien upon  any of the properties or assets of any Loan Party (other than any  Liens created under any of the Loan Documents in  favor of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured  Parties); or (d) require any approval of stockholders, members  or partners or any approval or consent of    66      #96555161v28    </FONT></DIV>

Section 4.05.  Governmental Consents. The execution, delivery and performance by the Loan   Parties  of  the  Loan  Documents  to  which  they  are  parties  and  the  consummation  of  the  transactions   contemplated by the Loan Documents do not and shall not require any registration with, consent or approval  of, or  notice to, or other action to, with or by, any Governmental Authority (other than any filings or reports  required  under the securities laws) except as otherwise set forth in the Loan Documents and except for  filings and  recordings with respect to the Collateral to be made, or otherwise delivered to the Collateral  Agent for filing  and/or recordation. Holdings and each Subsidiary has all consents, permits, approvals and  licenses of each  Governmental Authority necessary in connection with the operation and performance of  its Core Business  Activities, except in each case as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material  Adverse Effect.    Section 4.06.  Binding Obligation. Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered  by  each Loan Party that is a party to such Loan Document and is the legally valid and binding obligation  of such  Loan Party, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its respective terms, except as  may  be   limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  or  similar  laws  of  general  applicability  relating to or limiting creditors&#8217; rights or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.    Section 4.07.  Financial  Statements.  The  Historical  Financial  Statements  delivered  to  the   Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger fairly present in all material respects on a Consolidated basis  the  assets, liabilities and financial position of Holdings (and its Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis) as at  such  dates, and the results of the operations and changes of financial position for the periods then ended  (other than  customary year-end adjustments for unaudited financial statements and the absence of footnotes).  All such  financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in  accordance   with  GAAP.  Such  financial  statements  show  all  Material  Indebtedness  and  other  material  liabilities, direct or  contingent, of Holdings (and its Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis) as of the date  thereof,  including  material   liabilities  for  taxes  and  material  commitments,  in  each  case,  to  the  extent    required to be disclosed under GAAP.    Section 4.08.  No Material Adverse Change. Since December 12, 2022, there has been no event    or circumstance, either individually or in the aggregate, that has had or would reasonably be expected to  have a  Material Adverse Effect.    Section 4.09.  Tax Returns and Payments.    (a)  Each of Holdings and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns    required by applicable Law to be filed, and has paid all Taxes, assessments and governmental charges or  levies  upon it or its property, income, profits and assets which are due and payable (including in its capacity  as a  withholding agent), whether or not shown on a Tax return, except for (i) those that are being diligently  contested  in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which Holdings or the relevant Subsidiary shall  have set aside  on its books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP or (ii) where the failure would not  reasonably be  expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Authorized Officer has knowledge of any  proposed Tax  assessment against Holdings or any Subsidiary that would, if made, have a Material Adverse  Effect.    (b)  Interest payments on the Loans will be treated entirely as &#8220;income from sources   without the United States&#8221; (within the meaning of section 862 of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S.   federal income tax purposes.    67      #96555161v28    </FONT></DIV>

Section 4.11.  Governmental Regulation. None of Holdings nor any Subsidiary is subject to   regulation under the Federal Power Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or under any other federal  or  state statute or regulation which may limit its ability to incur Indebtedness or which may otherwise render  all or  any portion of the Obligations unenforceable.

Upon  request  by  the  Administrative  Agent  at  any  time,  the  Required  Lenders  will  confirm  in  writing  the Administrative Agent&#8217;s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items  of property,  or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section  9.10. In each case as  specified in this Section 9.10, the Administrative Agent will, at the Borrower&#8217;s expense,  execute and deliver to the  applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request  to evidence the release of such  item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under  the Security Agreement and the other  Loan Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to  release such Subsidiary Guarantor from its  obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with  the terms of the Loan Documents and this  Section 9.10.

Without limiting the foregoing, no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon  any of  the Collateral or to enforce the Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and  remedies  under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Agents on behalf of the Secured Parties  in accordance  with the terms thereof. In the event of a foreclosure by the Collateral Agent on any of the  Collateral  pursuant  to   a  public  or  private  sale  or  other  disposition  (including  any  sale  or  disposition  conducted under a plan of  reorganization), any Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of such  Collateral at any such sale or other  disposition, and the Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of  the Secured Parties (but not any Lender  in its individual capacities) shall be entitled, at the direction of the  Required Lenders, for the purpose of bidding  and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for  all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such  sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit  on account of the purchase price for any Collateral  payable by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured  Parties at such sale or other disposition. Each Secured  Party, whether or not a party hereto, will be deemed,  by its acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral and of the  Guaranty provided under the Loan Documents,  to have agreed to the foregoing provisions. The provisions of this  paragraph are for the sole benefit of the  Secured Parties and shall not afford any right to, or constitute a defense  available to, any Loan Party.    Section 9.11.

In connection with any assignment of rights  and  obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless  and until, in  addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment  shall make such  additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient,  upon distribution  thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee  of participations or  subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the  consent of the Borrower  and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro-rata share of Loans  previously requested but not  funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable  assignee and assignor hereby  irrevocably consent), to pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities  then owed by such Defaulting Lender  to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and  interest accrued thereon). Notwithstanding the  foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights  and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder  shall become effective under applicable Law  without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph,  then the assignee of such interest shall  be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this  Agreement until such compliance  occurs.        112      #96555161v28    </FONT></DIV>

In case of an assignment, transfer or novation by  a  Lender of all or any part of its rights and obligations under any of the Loan Documents, such  Lender  and assignee Lender shall agree that, for the purposes of Article 1278 of the Luxembourg  Civil Code (to  the extent applicable), the security interest created under the Security Documents  securing the rights  assigned, transferred or novated thereby, will be preserved for the benefit of the  assignee Lender.    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c)  of  this Section 10.06, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the  assignee  thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such  Assignment and  Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the  assigning Lender  thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,  be released from its  obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance  covering all of the  assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease  to be a party hereto but  shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 10.04  with respect to facts and  circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment); provided    that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting   Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender&#8217;s  having  been a Defaulting Lender.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this  Agreement that does  not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a  sale by such Lender of a  participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of  this Section 10.06.    (c)  Register.    (i)  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the    Borrower (and such agency being solely for Tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative  Agent&#8217;s  Office a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof  in electronic  form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders,  and the  Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each  Lender  pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the &#8220;Register&#8221;). The entries in the Register  shall be  conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the  Lenders shall  treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof  as a Lender  hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for  inspection by the  Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon  reasonable prior notice. In  addition, at any time that a request for consent for a material or other  substantive change to the Loan  Documents is pending, any Lender may request and receive from  the Administrative Agent a copy of  the Register.

Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to,  the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a  Defaulting   Lender  or  the  Borrower  or  any  of  the  Borrower&#8217;s  Affiliates  or  Subsidiaries)  (each,  a  &#8220;Participant&#8221;)  in all or a portion of such Lender&#8217;s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including  all or a portion of its  Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender&#8217;s obligations  under this Agreement  shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other  parties hereto for the  performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and  the Lenders shall continue  to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender&#8217;s  rights and obligations under this  Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible  for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c)  without regard to the existence of any participation.    Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide  that such  Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to  approve any  amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any of the other  Loan Documents;  provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not,  without the consent of  the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in  subclauses (iii), (iv), (v), (ix)  and (x) of clause (y) of the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such  Participant and requires the consent  of each Lender directly affected thereby. The Borrower agrees that  each Participant shall be entitled to the  benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it  were a Lender and had acquired its interest by  assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 10.06  (it being understood that the documentation required  under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender  who sells the participation); provided that such  Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of  Sections 3.06 and 10.14 as if it were an assignee under  subsection (b) of this Section 10.06 and (B) shall  not  be  entitled  to  receive  any  greater  payment  under  Sections   3.01, 3.04  or 3.05,  with  respect  to  any  participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable  participation would have been entitled  to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater  payment results from a Change in Law  that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation  agrees, at the Borrower&#8217;s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to  cooperate with the Borrower to  effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the  extent permitted by law,  each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were  a Lender; provided  that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender. Each  Lender that sells  a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower,  maintain a  register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated   interest) of each Participant&#8217;s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the   &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of  the   Participant  Register  (including  the  identity  of  any  Participant  or  any  information  relating  to  a   Participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any  Person  except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or  other obligation  is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the  Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat  each Person whose  name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all  purposes of this Agreement  notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the  Administrative Agent (in its  capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining  a Participant Register.    (e)  Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest  in all or  any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations  of such  Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;  provided that  no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder  or substitute any  such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.      114      #96555161v28    </FONT></DIV>

Except as provided in Section 5.03, this  Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed  by the Administrative Agent and when the  Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof  that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each  of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed  counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile  or other electronic imaging means (e.g. &#8220;pdf&#8221;  or &#8220;tif&#8221;) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed  counterpart of this Agreement.

All representations and warranties  made  hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto  or in connection  herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.
