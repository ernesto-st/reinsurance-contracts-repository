any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC
Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a
proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to
no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of
the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. </P>

it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Guarantor hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the &#147;<U>specified currency</U>&#148;) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent&#146;s main New
York City office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-appealable</FONT> judgment is given. The obligations of the Guarantor in respect of any sum due hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in
a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by any holder of Obligations (including the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender), as the case may be, of any sum
adjudged to be so due in such other currency such holder of Obligations (including the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender), as the case may be, may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency
with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such holder of Obligations (including the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender), as the case may be, in the specified
currency, the Guarantor agrees to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such holder of Obligations (including the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender),
as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a)&nbsp;the sum originally due to any holder of Obligations (including the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender), as the case may be, in
the specified currency and (b)&nbsp;amounts shared with other holders of Obligations as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such other holder of Obligations under Section&nbsp;2.12 of the Credit Agreement, such
holder of Obligations (including the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender), as the case may be, agrees, by accepting the benefits hereof, to remit such excess to the Guarantor. </P>
