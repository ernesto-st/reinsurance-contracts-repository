<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this
Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties
as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term &#147;agent&#148; herein and
in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any
fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is
intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties.

Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each such L/C Issuer shall
have all of the benefits and immunities (i)&nbsp;provided to the Agents in this Article&nbsp;IX with
respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in connection with
Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and
agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the
term &#147;Agent&#148; as used in this Article&nbsp;IX and in the definition of &#147;Agent-Related Person&#148;
included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii)&nbsp;as additionally
provided herein with respect to such L/C Issuer.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Administrative Agent shall also act as the &#147;collateral agent&#148; under the Loan
Documents, and each of the Lenders (in its capacities as a Lender, Swing Line Lender (if
applicable), L/C Issuer (if applicable) and a potential Hedge Bank) hereby irrevocably
appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of (and to hold any
security interest created by the Collateral Documents for and on behalf of or on trust for)
such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on
Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations,
together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this
connection, the Administrative Agent, as &#147;collateral agent&#148; (and any co-agents, sub-agents
and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.02 for
purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof)

enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral
Documents or of exercising any rights and remedies thereunder) by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any agent or sub-agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct (as determined in the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction).

Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, or the perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest created or purported
to be created under the Collateral Documents, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any other
party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related
Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to
the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan
Party or any Affiliate thereof.

upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic
mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), independent
accountants and other experts selected by such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified
in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first
receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if
it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against
any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of
Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a

account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a
Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such

of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to any Event of
Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article&nbsp;VIII; provided that

review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including
whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender
represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and
other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all
applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made
its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower and the other
Loan Parties hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan
Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

any other Person. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share (determined at the time such indemnity is

Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default under Section&nbsp;8.01(f)

successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative

successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent
hereunder, the Person acting as such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
