<P ALIGN="CENTER">STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of November&nbsp;25, 2003, among Sierra Health Services, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&quot;<U>Sierra</U>&quot;), CII Financial, Inc., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sierra (the &quot;<U>Seller</U>&quot;) and Folksamerica Holding Company, Inc., a New York corporation (the &quot;<U>Purchaser</U>&quot;).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">W I T N E S S E T H:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of California Indemnity Insurance Company, a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller (the &quot;<U>Company</U>&quot;);</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company and the Subsidiaries are engaged in the business of workers' compensation insurance (the &quot;<U>Business</U>&quot;); and</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell and transfer to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to purchase from the Seller, 140,000 shares of the common stock, par value  $100 per share, of the Company (the &quot;<U>Shares</U>&quot;), constituting all of the shares of capital stock of the Company issued and outstanding on the Closing Date, all as more specifically provided herein.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and undertakings contained herein, and subject to and on the terms and conditions herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:</P>


<P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE I<BR>
<U>Purchase and Sale of the Shares</U></P>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Purchase and Sale of the Shares</U>.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and on the basis of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, undertakings and obligations contained herein, at the Closing the Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Seller, and the Seller agrees to sell to the Purchaser, the Shares free and clear of all Liens, which constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, for the consideration specified in Section 1.2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Purchase Price</U>.    (a)The purchase price (the &quot;<U>Purchase Price</U>&quot;) for the Shares shall consist of (i)&nbsp;$15,500,000 payable at the Closing, subject to adjustment as set forth in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 and to the proscription set forth in Section 1.2(b) (the &quot;<U>Cash Purchase Price</U>&quot;) <U>plus</U> (ii) the Contingent Purchase Price of $64,000,000 subject to adjustment as set forth in Sections 1.2(b), 1.3 and 1.4 and in the Contingent Purchase Price Note Agreement (such amount, as adjusted, the &quot;<U>Contingent Purchase Price</U>&quot;).  In addition, if the Fair Market Value of the Fixed Income and Preferred Securities, as determined pursuant to the immediately following sentence, exceeds the SAP value thereof shown on the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet then the Purchaser will pay 65% of such excess to the Seller at the Closing.  If the SAP value of the Fixed Income and Preferred Securities shown on the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet exceeds the Fair Market Value thereof as determined pursuant to the immediately following sentence then the Seller will pay 65% of such excess to the Purchaser.  For purposes of calculating the amount to be paid to the Seller or the Purchaser on the Closing Date, the Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, determine the Fair Market Value of the Fixed Income and Preferred Securities as of the close of the last Business Day of the calendar month immediately preceding the Closing Date, and a written statement thereof shall be delivered to the Purchaser on the Closing Date.  </P>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including Section 1.4, the Cash Purchase Price shall not be increased above $15,500,000 in respect of any adjustment to the reserves of the Company and the Subsidiaries on account of the Company's and/or any Subsidiary's recognition of any redundancy in respect of loss or loss adjustment expense reserves between the date hereof and the Closing Date.  Any upward adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price that would have been made in the absence of the immediately foregoing proscription (a &quot;<U>Proscribed Cash Purchase Price Increase</U>&quot;) shall instead increase the Contingent Purchase Price dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such Proscribed Cash Purchase Price Increase.</P>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Pre-Closing Adjustment of Cash Purchase Price</U>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Not later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Seller, at its expense, shall deliver to Purchaser a balance sheet (the &quot;<U>Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet</U>&quot;) of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the last day of the most recent calendar month preceding the Closing Date for which a balance sheet reasonably can be prepared, prepared in accordance with SAP consistent with the preparation of the Annual Statutory Statements and the Quarterly Statutory Statements, setting forth in reasonable detail the Seller's estimate of the Company's and the Subsidiaries' statutory surplus as of the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the Closing Date (the &quot;<U>Estimated Statutory Surplus</U>&quot;).  The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Estimated Statutory Surplus shall be prepared in good faith based on the Seller's review of the financial information then available to it and inquiries of personnel responsible for the preparation of financial information relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Estimated Statutory Surplus, as set forth on the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, is greater than $90,730,000, then the Contingent Purchase Price shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the Estimated Statutory Surplus is greater than $90,730,000.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Estimated Statutory Surplus, as set forth on the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, is less than $90,730,000 but greater than or equal to $88,730,000, then the Cash Purchase Price shall remain at $15,500,000 and the Contingent Purchase Price shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the Estimated Statutory Surplus is less than $90,730,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Estimated Statutory Surplus, as set forth on the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, is less than $88,730,000, then (x) the Contingent Purchase Price shall be reduced by $2,000,000 and (y) the Cash Purchase Price shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the Estimated Statutory Surplus is less than $88,730,000.  The Cash Purchase Price shall not be reduced below $0 as a result of this Section 1.3(b)(iii), but any adjustment that would otherwise bring the Cash Purchase Price below $0 shall result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the Contingent Purchase Price.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price</U>.  </P>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 75&nbsp;days after the Closing Date, the Seller, at its cost, shall deliver to the Purchaser a balance sheet (the &quot;<U>Closing Date Balance Sheet</U>&quot;) of the Company and the Subsidiaries, accompanied by an independent auditor's report prepared on a statutory basis of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP to the effect that such Closing Date Balance Sheet presents fairly in all material respects the statutory surplus of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the &quot;<U>Closing Date Statutory Surplus</U>&quot;) and was prepared in accordance with SAP consistent with the preparation of the Annual Statutory Statements and the Quarterly Statutory Statements.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 30 days after the date on which the Purchaser has received the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Purchaser, if the Purchaser disagrees with the Closing Date Balance Sheet, shall deliver to the Seller a notice setting forth in reasonable detail the items or amounts with which the Purchaser disagrees and the Purchaser's proposed corrections thereto.  If the Purchaser does not deliver such a notice within such 30-day period, the Purchaser shall be deemed to agree in all respects with the Closing Date Balance Sheet, except in the case of fraud.</p>

The Neutral Auditor shall deliver to the Purchaser and the Seller, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but no later than thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the Neutral Auditor is engaged, a written report setting forth its determinations with respect to the disputed items.  Upon such delivery, such report shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Seller.  The Purchaser and the Seller agree to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter.  The fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor arising from such engagement shall be paid by the parties pro rata based on where the Neutral Auditor's determination of Closing Date Statutory Surplus falls in comparison to Sierra's and the Purchaser's calculations; <U>provided</U> that, if the Closing Date Statutory Surplus as determined by the Neutral Auditor is greater than the amount determined by Sierra, the Purchaser shall bear all such fees and expenses, and if the Closing Date Statutory Surplus as determined by the Neutral Auditor is less than the amount determined by the Purchaser, Sierra shall bear all such fees and expenses.</p>

Sierra and the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser (and the Company and the Subsidiaries, after the Closing), on the other hand, will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers and all material records or other documents relating to Tax matters (&quot;<U>Tax Books and Records</U>&quot;) of the Company and the Subsidiaries for each taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of:  (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Books and Records relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified by the other party(ies) in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods or (ii)&nbsp;six (6) years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns; <U>provided</U>, that after such time, and before either Sierra or the Seller, on the one hand, or the Purchaser (and the Company and the Subsidiaries, after the Closing), on the other hand, shall dispose, or cause the disposal, of any of such Tax Books and Records, at least ninety (90) calendar days prior written notice to such effect shall be given by the party wishing to dispose of such Tax Books and Records to the other parties, and such other parties shall be given an opportunity, at their respective sole cost and expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such Tax Books and Records as any such party may select; <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that in no event shall any party be required to disclose any information relating to its operations other than the Company and the Subsidiaries.  Any information obtained under this Section 3.4(c) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting any Contest or as otherwise may be required by Applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Indemnification</U>.  </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)After the Closing Date, Sierra and the Seller agree, jointly and severally, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries from and against (A) any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary attributable to or apportioned (based on the principles set forth in this Section 3.4(d)) to any period or portion of a period ending on or before the Closing Date (the &quot;<U>Pre-Closing Period</U>&quot;) except to the extent such Taxes are accrued as a liability on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and taken into account in determining the Closing Date Statutory Surplus, (B)&nbsp;any Taxes imposed on the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of any breach of warranty or misrepresentation under Section&nbsp;2.1(r) or failure to perform under Section 3.4(a), (C)&nbsp;any Taxes imposed on any member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group with which any of the Company or any Subsidiary was a member prior to the Closing for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date for which the Company or any Subsidiary is liable pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, (D) any Taxes for which Seller is responsible under Section 3.4(g) and any other Taxes imposed on either Seller or its subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Company or any Subsidiary), and (E) any losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's, accountant's, consultant's and expert's fees and expenses) resulting from the foregoing, in each case reduced by the amount of any Tax benefit to the Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiaries resulting from the event or occurrence giving rise to the obligation to indemnify hereunder.  The Seller shall pay such amounts as they are obligated to pay the Purchaser under the preceding sentence within five (5) Business Days after payment of any applicable Tax liability by the Purchaser, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates from and against (A) any Taxes of the Company or a Subsidiary that are allocable to or apportioned (based on the principles set forth in this Section 3.4(d)) to a period or portion of a period beginning after the Closing Date (the &quot;<U>Post-Closing Period</U>&quot;) other than any such Taxes for which the Seller has an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Section 3.4(d), (B)&nbsp;any Taxes for which the Purchaser is responsible under Section 3.4(g) and any other all Taxes imposed on either the Purchaser or its subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Company or any Subsidiary), and (C) any losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's, accountant's, consultant's and expert's fees and expenses) resulting from the foregoing, in each case reduced by the amount of any Tax benefit to the Seller or its Affiliates resulting from the event or occurrence giving rise to the obligation to indemnify hereunder.  The Purchaser shall pay such amounts within five (5) Business Days after payment of any such Tax liability by the Seller or an Affiliate thereof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be:</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent provided under Section 3.4(g)), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the Tax year ended with the Closing Date; and</LI>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notification of Proceedings; Control; Refunds</U>.  </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)After the Closing, in the event that the Purchaser or the Company or any Subsidiary receives notice, whether orally or in writing, of any pending or threatened Tax audit, examinations, claims, adjustments, assessments, administrative or judicial proceeding or related matter with respect to Taxes (a &quot;<U>Contest</U>&quot;) for which the Seller is responsible under Section 3.4(d), or if a Seller receives such notice of such matters with respect to Taxes for which the Purchaser is responsible under Section 3.4(d), the party receiving notice shall notify in writing the potentially affected party within ten (10) days thereof; <U>provided</U> that a party that is not provided with such notice shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations hereunder only to the extent that such delay in notice resulted in actual harm to such party.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)Each of the Seller and the Purchaser (as applicable, the &quot;<U>Controlling Party</U>&quot;) shall have the sole right (except as otherwise specified in this Section 3.4(e)) to control any Contest, initiate any claim for refund, file any amended return, contest, resolve and defend against any assessment, notice of deficiency or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to or with respect to those Tax Returns that it is required to prepare and file pursuant to Section 3.4(b); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in the event that any such adjustment could have an adverse effect on the Taxes for which the other party (the &quot;<U>Affected Party</U>&quot;) is responsible under Section 3.4(d), the Controlling Party (A) shall give the Affected Party written notice of any such adjustment, (B) shall permit the Affected Party to participate in the proceeding to the extent the adjustment may affect the Taxes for which the Affected Party is responsible under Section 3.4(d) and (C) shall not settle or otherwise compromise such proceeding without the prior written consent of the Affected Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)The Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller an amount equal to any Tax refunds or credits (except to the extent such refund is the result of the carry back of a net operating or capital loss of the Company or any Subsidiary arising in a Post-Closing Period as a result of Applicable Law not permitting the election described in the last sentence of this Section 3.4(e)(iii)) attributable to any Pre-Closing Period received or credited to the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary, net of any direct costs attributable to receipt of such refund or credit, including Taxes payable with respect to such refund, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such refund or credit; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Seller shall only be entitled to Taxes refunded to the Purchaser to the extent that such refund is in excess of a specific accrual provided therefor on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and taken into account in the determination of Closing Date Statutory Surplus.  All refunds of Taxes of the Company and any Subsidiary attributable to any Post-Closing Period or Pre-Closing Period and not payable to the Seller pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be for the benefit of the Purchaser and if received or otherwise credited to the Seller or any Affiliate thereof (other than the Company or any Subsidiary), the Seller shall pay an amount equal to such refund or credit net of any direct costs attributable to receipt of such refund or credit to the Purchaser within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such refund or credit.  At the Seller's request, the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Seller in obtaining such refunds, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims as prepared by the Seller, at its own expense; and, at the Purchaser's request, Sierra and the Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser in obtaining such refunds, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims as prepared by the Purchaser, at its own expense.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Purchaser shall elect, or cause an election to be made, to waive the carry back of all net operating or capital losses of the Company or any Subsidiary that would otherwise be carried back to a Pre-Closing Period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Tax Effect of Payments</U>.  Sierra and the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to treat all payments made by either to or for the benefit of the other (including any payments to the Company or any Subsidiary) under this Section 3.4 and under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement, as adjustments to the Purchase Price or as capital contributions for Tax purposes and that such agreed treatment shall govern for Tax purposes hereof, except to the extent that the laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise, in which case such payments shall be made in an amount sufficient, taking into account Tax benefits and detriments, to indemnify the relevant party on an after-Tax basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Transfer Taxes</U>.  The Purchaser and the Seller will each be liable for one half of all sales, use, recording, transfer or similar taxes arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the foregoing, including, without limitation, allocating the Purchase Price to each asset subject to such Taxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>FIRPTA Certificate</U>.  The Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser on the Closing Date a FIRPTA Certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, certifying that Seller is not a &quot;foreign person&quot; for the purposes of Section 1445 of the Code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Conduct of Business on and following the Closing Date</U>.  Neither Sierra or the Seller, on the one hand, nor the Purchaser or any Affiliate, on the other hand, shall make or cause to be made any election or take or cause to be taken any action which would increase the other party's liability to pay Taxes pursuant to the terms of this Agreement unless such election or action is required by Applicable Law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Tax Rights and Obligations</U>.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, all rights and obligations with respect to Taxes shall be governed solely by Section 2.1(r), this Section 3.4 and Section 5.1 of this Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Miscellaneous</U>.  </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)Regardless of whether a Contest is commenced, if Sierra or the Seller becomes aware of the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding which is reasonably expected to result in any liability for which Sierra and the Seller have agreed to indemnify the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4(d), Sierra or the Seller shall promptly so inform the Purchaser in writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)All indemnities under this Section 3.4 shall be paid dollar-for-dollar, in accordance with their terms, without regard to any caps, floors, baskets or other similar limitations; <U>provided</U> that the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion and upon written notice to the Seller, elect to treat any indemnification to which it would be entitled under this Section 3.4 as an offset against the minimum Contingent Purchase Price under Section 2.1(d) of the Contingent Purchase Price Note Agreement.  </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Non-Admitted Assets</U>.  </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Sierra will be entitled to retain all fully depreciated and non-admitted assets excluded from the Closing Date Balance Sheet, which are set forth on <U>Schedule 2</U> hereto.  In furtherance thereof, Sierra shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to convey such non-admitted assets to Sierra on or prior to Closing.  Sierra shall cause an updated version of <U>Schedule 2</U> to be delivered to the Purchaser five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.  The Purchaser will, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sierra and its Affiliates with regard to collection and realization efforts in connection with any such assets, including any assets purchased pursuant to Section 3.5(b).  Sierra and the Seller jointly and severally agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries, dollar-for-dollar (without regard to any caps, floors, baskets or other similar limitations), for any Damages and other liabilities arising out of or relating to any attempt by Sierra and its Affiliates (including, without limitation, through any collection or recovery proceedings) in connection with any collection and realization efforts undertaken in connection with any such non-admitted assets or assets purchased pursuant to Section 3.5(b).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sierra and the Seller jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Purchaser for all reasonable expenses incurred by Purchaser in complying with the provisions of Sections 3.5(a) and (b), such reimbursement to be provided no later than two (2) Business Days following the delivery from time to time by the Purchaser to Sierra or the Seller of a statement setting forth such expenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Seller shall purchase from the Purchaser, for cash in immediately available funds, all uncollected premium receivables that (i) were included as admitted assets on the Closing Date Balance Sheet; (ii) became non-admitted assets within the one (1) year period following the Closing; and (iii)&nbsp;remain non-admitted assets on such date.  The purchase price for such premiums receivables shall be the amount attributed thereto as statutory surplus on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and as may be recorded by the Company and the Subsidiaries on their respective Statutory Statements following the Closing.  From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the Seller and its Affiliates with reasonable assistance in connection with the collection of any such funds which reasonable assistance shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Seller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Non-admitted DTA</U>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)Purchaser shall pay Seller, in the manner described in this Section 3.5(c), for the statutory non-admitted deferred income tax asset on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the &quot;<U>Non-admitted DTA</U>&quot;) resulting from non-deductible reserves of the Company and the Subsidiaries for losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses and unallocated loss adjustment expenses (such reserves are the &quot;<U>LLAE</U>&quot;), calculated in accordance with Section 846 of the Code using, as appropriate, Company experience elections in effect as of the Closing Date and the Tax Rate, as the benefit of this asset is includible by the Purchaser as a deduction in subsequent Federal income tax returns, regardless of whether such item of deduction results in a current reduction of Tax or a Tax refund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)At the time Seller delivers the Closing Date Balance Sheet to Purchaser, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a calculation of the Non-admitted DTA and, in accordance with GAAP, of the deferred income tax asset of the Company and the Subsidiaries (exclusive of any valuation adjustment) resulting from LLAE (the &quot;<U>Closing Date DTA</U>&quot;), accompanied by an independent auditor's report of Deloitte &amp; Touche to the effect that such calculation presents fairly the Closing Date DTA of the Company and the Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP and Non-admitted DTA in accordance with SAP, it being understood that for purposes of this Section 3.5(c), all of the Non-admitted DTA shall be deemed to be resulting from LLAE.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)Purchaser shall, with respect to each taxable year of the Company and the Subsidiaries ending after the Closing Date, calculate in accordance with GAAP the remaining portion (the &quot;<U>Remaining DTA</U>&quot;) of the Closing Date DTA as of the end of such year.  For the avoidance of doubt, adjustments to the Closing Date DTA of the Company and the Subsidiaries shall be made for these purposes as a result of actual payments relating to the LLAE and not as a result of any adjustments to the reserves after the Closing as a result of reserve strengthening.  The Purchaser shall pay the Seller an amount equal to the product of the Non-admitted DTA and a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the difference between the Remaining DTA as of the close of the immediately preceding taxable year (or, in the case of the first taxable year following the Closing Date, the Closing Date DTA) and the Remaining DTA at the close of such taxable year, and the denominator of which shall be the Closing Date DTA.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)The calculations of Remaining DTA will be based on tax returns filed by the Purchaser and any payments required to be made by the Purchaser hereunder shall be made within 180 days of the end of the taxable year to which such tax returns relate.  Purchaser shall not be required to make any calculations for any taxable year after the first taxable year in which the Remaining DTA equals zero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)In the event Purchaser or Seller disagrees with the calculations of Non-admitted DTA, Closing Date DTA or Remaining DTA, the Purchaser or Seller may dispute such calculations in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.4(c) hereof.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)The obligation of Purchaser to pay Seller for the Non-admitted DTA shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or the Contingent Purchase Price Note Agreement unless the Purchaser and the Seller agree that the Purchaser will pay any remaining amount to Seller on a net present value basis at June 30, 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)For purposes of this section, &quot;Tax Rate&quot; shall mean the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate for corporations in effect under Section 11 of the Code for the year as of which the Closing Date DTA or Remaining DTA, as the case may be, is being determined, which is 35% for 2003.  Any change in the Tax Rate shall be taken into account in recalculating the Closing Date DTA or Remaining DTA, which adjustments shall be made in accordance with GAAP, and any payments required under this Section 3.5(c) will be adjusted to reflect such recalculations.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Access Prior to Closing</U>.  Sierra and the Seller shall afford the Purchaser and its representatives (including, without limitation, its independent public accountants and counsel) reasonable access upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours from the date hereof until the Closing Date to any and all of the premises, properties and Records relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries (including access to Tillinghast Towers-Perrin, the Company's independent actuary, subject to the Purchaser's execution of customary access letters) for the purpose of enabling the Purchaser to confirm the</A> <A NAME="_Toc57552500">accuracy of Sierra and the Seller's representations and warranties, and its compliance with its covenants, contained in this Agreement and to keep itself apprised of the business, affairs, operations and financial results of the Company and the Subsidiaries, but not to permit the Purchaser to participate in the management of the business of the Seller, the Company or the Subsidiaries.  Sierra and the Seller shall cause the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries to provide reasonable assistance to the Purchaser in the Purchaser's investigation of matters relating to the purchase of the Shares; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Purchaser's investigation shall be conducted in a manner which does not interfere in any material respect with the Company's or the Subsidiary's normal operations, customers and employee relations.  No investigation or access to information pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall affect any representation or warranty made by Sierra or the Seller to the Purchaser hereunder or otherwise affect the rights and remedies available to the Purchaser hereunder.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Maintenance and Preservation of Records</U>.  Through the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to maintain the Records in all material respects in the same manner and with the same care that the Records have been maintained prior to the execution of this Agreement.  The Purchaser agrees that it shall preserve and keep the Records of the Company and the Subsidiaries delivered to it hereunder for a period not exceeding the greater of (x) seven (7) years from the Closing Date and (y) the maximum period required under Applicable Law, and shall make such Records available to Sierra or the Seller for inspection and copying at Sierra's own expense for any reasonable purpose, including in connection with the matters described in Sections 3.1, 3.4 and 3.15 and the agreements contemplated by the Contingent Purchase Price Note Agreement, at the Seller's expense.  In the event the Purchaser wishes to destroy such Records after that time, it shall first give thirty (30) days' prior written notice to each of Sierra and the Seller and each of Sierra and the Seller shall have the right at its option and at their expense, upon prior written notice given to the Purchaser within said 30-day period, to take possession of said records within sixty 60 days after the date of such notice to the Purchaser.  In addition, following the Closing Date, the Seller agrees that it will allow the Purchaser and its representatives (including, without limitation, its independent public accountants and counsel) reasonable access upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours, to Records which remain in the Seller's possession.  In the event the Seller wishes to destroy such Records, it shall first give thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall have the right at its option and at its expense upon written notice given to the Seller within said 30-day period, to take possession of said Records within sixty (60) days after the date of such notice to the Seller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Confidentiality and Announcements</U>.  </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of the letter agreement dated as of September&nbsp;16, 2002 (the &quot;<U>Confidentiality Agreement</U>&quot;) between Sierra and the Purchaser are herewith incorporated by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until Closing and if this Agreement is terminated shall remain in full force and effect after such termination; <U>provided</U> that, following the Closing Date, Sierra and the Seller jointly and severally covenant and agree to keep all non-public information relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries confidential on the same terms as set forth for the Purchaser in the Confidentiality Agreement.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;From and after the date hereof through the Closing Date, the Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of any non-public personal health and financial information of policyholders, or claimants under policies, of the Company or any Subsidiary in its possession in accordance with Applicable Law and will, with respect to such information, comply with all Applicable Laws pertaining to the confidentiality of such personal financial and personal health information including, without limitation, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 6801-6827 and any other applicable state or federal privacy rules or regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, each party hereto (and each employee, representative, or other agent of any party) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of any and all transaction(s) contemplated herein and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to any party (or to any employee, representative, or other agent of any party) relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that this authorization of disclosure shall not apply to restrictions reasonably necessary to comply with securities laws.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Sierra and the Seller jointly and severally hereby agree to indemnify, reimburse, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or representatives thereof (including, effective as of the Closing Date, the Company and the Subsidiaries), and their respective successors and assigns from and against any Damages asserted against, relating to, imposed upon or incurred or suffered by any of them based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of (i) any breach or violation of any agreement, covenant, undertaking, obligation, representation or warranty of Sierra or the Seller contained in this Agreement or in any of the Operative Documents including, without limitation, the covenants contained in Section 3.16, and (ii) any Damages that are related directly or primarily to the Seller's, Sierra's, the Company's or any Subsidiary's pre-closing bad faith acts with regard to claims payment procedures, for which Sierra and the Seller shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Purchaser dollar-for-dollar (without regard to any caps, floors, baskets or other similar limitations); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that this Section 5.2(a) shall not apply to any claims with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of Section 3.4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, reimburse, defend and hold harmless Sierra and the Seller and their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and representatives thereof, and their respective successors and assigns from and against any Damages asserted against, relating to, imposed upon or incurred or suffered by any of them based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any (i) breach or violation of any agreement, covenant, undertaking, obligation, representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any of the Operative Documents or (ii) any Damages that are related directly and primarily to the Purchaser's or any Affiliate's post-Closing bad faith acts with regard to claims payment procedures, other than with respect to claims made under Post-Closing Policies or policies written by a purchaser of renewal rights of the Company or the Subsidiaries, for which Purchaser shall indemnify Sierra and the Seller dollar-for-dollar, (without regard to any caps, floors, baskets or other similar limitations); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that this Section 5.2(b) shall not apply to any claims with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of Section 3.4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The party entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.2 (the &quot;<U>Indemnitee</U>&quot;) shall notify the party liable for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.2 (the &quot;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&quot;) promptly after becoming aware of, and shall provide to the Indemnitee as soon as practicable thereafter all information and documentation necessary to support and verify, any Damages that the Indemnitee shall have determined to have given or may give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party  shall be given access to all books and records in the possession or under the control of the Indemnitee which the Indemnifying Party reasonably determines to be related to such claim.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnitee, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it is prejudiced by the Indemnitee's failure to give such notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Action by a third party (a&nbsp;&quot;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&quot;) against it, such Indemnitee shall, if a claim is to be made against an Indemnifying Party under this Article V, give notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim promptly, but the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnitee, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such Third Party Claim is prejudiced by the Indemnitee's failure to give such notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Third Party Claim is brought against an Indemnitee and it gives proper notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim and, to the extent that it elects to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim and provides notice to the Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, as long as it legitimately conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnitee under this Article V for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation.  If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i)&nbsp;no compromise, discharge or settlement of, or admission of liability in connection with, such claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnitee's written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnitee, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; (ii) the Indemnitee shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its written consent; and (iii) the Indemnitee shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense, and shall have the right to participate, at the Indemnitee's sole expense, in such defense, with counsel selected by it.  If proper notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within ten (10) days after the Indemnifying Party's receipt thereof, give notice to the Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any good faith determination made in such Third Party Claim or any good faith compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnitee, and the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee, which shall be promptly reimbursed for any such fees and expenses, as and when incurred.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification relating to Tax matters (including indemnification for breach of the representations and warranties of Section 2.1(r)) shall be governed by Section 3.4.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Limits on Indemnification</U>.  </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than with respect to (x) fraud or willful misconduct or (y) any breach of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.1(a), 2.1(b), 2.1(c), sub-Section (ii) of Section&nbsp;2.1(h)(i), 2.1(n), 2.1(o), 2.1(p), 2.1(s), 2.1(t) and the second and third sentences of 2.1(u), Sierra and the Seller shall not have any liability under Section 5.2 for breaches of representations and warranties unless (i)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of losses relating thereto exceeds an amount equal to $250,000 (after insurance and other recoveries on an after-Tax basis<B>)</B>, and then only to the extent of such excess and (ii) the maximum aggregate liability of Sierra and the Seller for breaches of representations and warranties shall not exceed $40,000,000.  In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the indemnities provided in Sections 3.1(b), 3.4(k)(ii), 3.5(a), 3.15(c), 3.16(b), and 3.20 shall not be subject to any caps, floors, baskets or similar limitations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than with respect to fraud, willful misconduct or a breach of Section&nbsp;2.2(a), Section&nbsp;2.2(b) or Section 2.2(c), the Purchaser shall not have any liability under Section 5.2(b) for breaches of representations and warranties (i) unless the aggregate amount of losses relating thereto exceeds an amount equal to<B> </B>$250,000<B> </B>(after insurance and other recoveries on an after-Tax basis<B>) </B>and then only to the extent of such excess and (ii) the maximum aggregate liability of the Purchaser for breaches of representations and warranties shall not exceed $40,000,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Operative Document, Sierra and the Seller shall have no liability or obligation to the Purchaser for any Damages to the extent the same is reflected or reserved on the Closing Date Balance Sheet as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.4 (and such liabilities shall not be included for purposes of calculating the deductible or cap set forth in Section 5.3(b)).  For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that nothing contained in this Section 5.3(c) shall preclude the Purchaser's recovery of Damages to the extent the Purchaser suffers Damages in excess of the applicable amount reflected or reserved on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Method of Payment</U>.  In the event an action for indemnification under this Article V shall have been finally determined, such final determination shall be paid to the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be, within two (2) Business Days in immediately available funds in U.S. dollars, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, until the obligations of Sierra or the Seller pursuant to this Article 5 exceed the minimum Contingent Purchase Price set forth in Section 2.1(d) of the Contingent Purchase Price Note Agreement, Sierra or the Seller may, at their sole option, elect instead to satisfy any such obligations by reducing such minimum Contingent Purchase Price. An action, and the liability for and amount of Damages therefor, shall be deemed to be &quot;<U>finally determined</U>&quot; for purposes of this Article V when the parties to such action have so determined by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a final non-appealable Order shall have been entered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Reserve Matters</U>.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Operative Document, except as provided in the following sentence, the rights and obligations of the parties following the Closing Date with respect to the Company's and the Subsidiaries' liabilities for insurance losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, the financial statement entries reflecting the same and any other matters covered by the Contingent Purchase Price Note Agreement (collectively, &quot;<U>Reserve Matters</U>&quot;) shall be governed exclusively by the Contingent Purchase Price Note Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event any representation or warranty of the Seller or Sierra is determined to have been inaccurate as a result of any facts or circumstances pertaining to a Reserve Matter, the Purchaser's rights and Sierra and the Seller's obligations</A> <A NAME="_Toc57552533">following the Closing Date shall be as set forth in the Contingent Purchase Price Note Agreement and the Purchaser shall not have separate recourse under this Agreement other than with respect to any inaccuracy arising out of or related to fraud or the willful misconduct of Sierra, the Seller, or the Company or any Subsidiary, provided that in the case of the Company or any Subsidiary such fraud or willful misconduct shall have occurred prior to the Closing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Sole Remedy</U>.  Except as set forth in Sections 3.4 and 5.5, the parties agree that the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article V are the exclusive provisions with respect to the liability of the parties for breach of representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or in any Operative Document following the Closing Date, <U>provided</U>, that nothing herein shall preclude either party from seeking remedy based upon fraud or willful misconduct.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Remedies</U>.  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that, unless and until this Agreement is properly terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1 hereof, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.</p>

When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.  Any fact or item disclosed on any section of the Seller's Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser's Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed on all other sections of the Seller's Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser's Disclosure Schedule respectively, to which such fact or item may apply, but only to the extent the application of such fact or item to such other section is reasonably apparent.  Disclosure of any item in the Seller's Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser's Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material item, fact, exception of fact, event or circumstance, that such disclosure is required thereon or that occurrence or non-occurrence of any change or effect related to such item would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.  The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement, the Seller's Disclosure Schedule and the Purchaser's Disclosure Schedule are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  Whenever the words &quot;include&quot;, &quot;includes&quot; or &quot;including&quot; are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words &quot;without limitation&quot;.  Whenever the singular is used herein, the same shall include the plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the same shall include the singular, where appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Counterparts</U>.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  Each counterpart may be delivered by facsimile transmission, which transmission shall be deemed delivery of an originally executed document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Assignment</U>.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  No party hereto may assign this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any Affiliate of the Purchaser, including, without limitation, Folksamerica Reinsurance Company, without the consent of Seller or Sierra.  In the event that Purchaser assigns its rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.6, the Purchaser shall remain liable for the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder to the extent such duties and obligations are not performed by its assignee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.7&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Miscellaneous</U>.  </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement:  (i) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof, <U>provided</U> that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as provided herein; (ii) is not intended to confer upon any other Persons, including, but not limited to, employees of the Company or any Subsidiary, any rights or remedies hereunder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any Applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument signed by each of the parties. Waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement shall only be effective if in writing and shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.8&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Specific Performance</U>.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the transactions contemplated herein, including the conveyance of the Shares, afford unique benefits to the parties, that a failure by any party to complete such transactions due to a breach of this Agreement will cause irreparable injury to the other parties and that actual damages for any such failure may be difficult to obtain and may be inadequate.  Consequently, the parties agree that each shall be, at the sole election of the non-breaching party, entitled to specific performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies to which such party may otherwise be entitled.  The parties further agree that the sale of the Shares to a third party, or the entering into of a definitive agreement to sell the Shares to a third party, by Sierra or the Seller prior to the consummation or termination of this Agreement shall constitute a breach of this Agreement entitling the Purchaser to the remedies referred to in this Section 7.8.</p>
