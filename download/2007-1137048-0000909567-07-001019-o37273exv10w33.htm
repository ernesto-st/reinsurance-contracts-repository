    <TD>During the second quarter of 2004, OARC pledged and placed on deposit at Lloyd&#146;s of London
the equivalent of &#163;110&nbsp;million of U.S. treasury notes on behalf of Advent Capital (Holdings)
PLC (&#147;Advent&#148;). Advent is 44.46% owned by Fairfax and its affiliates, including 8.12% by the
Borrower (4.06% by OARC and 4.06% by Clearwater). OARC retains the right to withdraw the funds
at Lloyd&#146;s at any time upon 180&nbsp;days advance written notice. The placement of funds at Lloyd&#146;s
will automatically terminate effective December&nbsp;31, 2008 and any remaining funds at Lloyd&#146;s
will revert to OARC at that time. In 2006 and 2007, OARC received three returns of assets
from Advent, representing a permanent reduction and unconditional releases of such amounts.
Following these releases, OARC continues to have a par value of $102.7&nbsp;million, or
approximately &#163;52.3&nbsp;million equivalent, pledged to Lloyd&#146;s in support of Advent.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">1. Clearwater agreed to allow Ranger Insurance Company (&#147;Ranger&#148;), a subsidiary of Fairfax that is
now known as Fairmont Specialty Insurance Company, to attach an assumption of liability endorsement
of Clearwater to certain Ranger policies issued from July&nbsp;1, 1999 to April&nbsp;30, 2004, the effective
termination date of the agreement. Should Ranger fail to meet its obligations, Clearwater is
ultimately liable for any losses occurring prior to the effective date of the termination, pursuant
to the terms of the endorsements. This arrangement enabled Ranger to provide additional security to
its customers as a result of Clearwater&#146;s financial strength ratings and capital resources. The
agreement to provide the endorsements was provided by Clearwater while each company was 100% owned
by Fairfax. The potential exposure in connection with the endorsements is estimated at $4.7
million, based on the subject policies&#146; outstanding case loss reserves as of March&nbsp;31, 2007. Ranger
has met and continues to meet all of its obligations, including those subject to this agreement, in
the normal course of business, and Clearwater does not anticipate making any payments under this
guarantee. In addition, Fairfax has indemnified Clearwater for any obligations under this
agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2. As of July&nbsp;14, 2000, OARC agreed to guarantee the performance of all of the insurance and
reinsurance contract obligations, whether incurred before or after the agreement, of Compagnie
Transcontinental de Reassurance (&#147;CTR&#148;), a subsidiary of Fairfax, in the event CTR became insolvent
and CTR was not otherwise indemnified under its guarantee agreement with a Fairfax affiliate. The
OARC guarantee, which was entered into while OARC and CTR were each 100% owned by Fairfax, was
provided by OARC to facilitate the transfer of renewal rights to CTR&#146;s business, together with
certain CTR employees, to OARC in 2000 in order to further expand OARC&#146;s international reinsurance
business. The guarantee was terminated effective December&nbsp;31, 2001. There were no amounts received
from CTR under the guarantee, and OARC did not provide any direct consideration for the renewal
rights to the business of CTR. Under Fairfax&#146;s ownership, CTR was dissolved and its assets and
liabilities were assumed by other Fairfax affiliates which have the responsibility for the run-off
of its liabilities. In addition, Fairfax has agreed to indemnify OARC for all its obligations
under its guarantee. OARC does not expect to make any payments under this guarantee.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">3. OARC agreed, as of April&nbsp;1, 2002, to guarantee the prompt payment of all of the insurance
contract obligations, whether incurred before or after the agreement, of Falcon Insurance Company
(Hong Kong) Limited, a subsidiary of Fairfax Asia Limited (&#147;Fairfax Asia&#148;), in the event that
Falcon becomes insolvent. Fairfax Asia is 100% owned by Fairfax, which includes a 27.7% interest
owned by OARC. OARC&#146;s potential exposure in connection with this agreement is estimated to be
$54.0&nbsp;million, based on Falcon&#146;s loss reserves at March&nbsp;31, 2007. Additionally, Fairfax has
agreed to indemnify OARC for

that will require OARC to utilize the indemnification from Fairfax.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">4. In January&nbsp;2004, in conjunction with the purchase by its subsidiary (O.R.E Holdings) of a 45%
interest in Cheran Enterprises Private Limited (&#147;CEPL&#148;), an Indian limited liability company
engaged in the purchase, development and sale of commercial real estate properties, OARC agreed to
provide a guarantee on behalf of CEPL to facilitate CEPL&#146;s establishment of a credit facility in
the amount of up to $65&nbsp;million. The credit agreement was never established, and the requisite
conditions for any future provision of the guarantee no longer exist. ORE&#146;s joint venture partner
is claiming that the guarantee should be available and is pursuing legal actions against OARC.
OARC finds this claim without merit and is vigorously defending the legal actions.
