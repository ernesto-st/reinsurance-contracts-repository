applicable) for the actual days elapsed. All other fees, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual days elapsed. The
Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Parent Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the determination thereof. Any change in the
interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate shall become
effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change. </FONT></P>

determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the

is the intent of the Lenders and the Borrowers to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. All agreements
between the Lenders and the Borrowers are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether
written or oral. In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any Obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted
for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under applicable law. If, from any possible construction of any
of the Credit Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this
paragraph and such interest shall be automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted under applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document. If any
Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum nonusurious
amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the payment of
interest, or refunded to the Borrowers or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans. The right to
demand payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such
demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest
on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law. </FONT></P>

Each optional prepayment of the Loans shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.7(a) and each mandatory prepayment of the Loans shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.7(b). Prepayments made

other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate
during such extension. If any payment on a LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless

certification has become obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, together with such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a
continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section

(as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the Parent Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service
Forms that establish a complete exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrowers shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 2.18(a) hereof to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender
in respect of Taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to the Parent Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the Parent Borrower pursuant

withholding of such Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section 2.18, the Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay additional
amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in Section 2.16(a) or 2.18(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any

the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless (a) a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer
thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent and (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received the written agreement of such assignee to be bound hereby as fully and to the same

Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrowers and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrowers. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty or

a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for
cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds

<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such
purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrowers agree that each Lender so purchasing a portion of another
Lender's Loans may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion. </FONT></P>
