completed. The parties intend to establish one GMP which shall constitute a
maximum price for that portion of the Work consisting of the Shell/Site
Improvements ("Shell/Site GMP") and a second GMP which shall constitute a
maximum price for that portion of the Work consisting of the Tenant Improvements
("TI GMP"). Each GMP shall include the applicable portion of the Contractor's
Fee and General Conditions. It is further anticipated that the Owner may
authorize the Contractor to proceed incrementally with the Work based on the
Contractor's receipt of documents from the Architect, pricing, and trade bids
acceptable to the Owner. In such case, a Change Order shall be executed
consistent with the cost and scope of the incremental work.

5.2.1.2 After both parties have signed this Agreement, Owner shall cause
drawings and specifications ("Plans") for the Project to be prepared by the
Architect containing sufficient detail to allow the Project to be bid by
Contractor.

5.2.1.3 Within 30 days after receipt of the Plans, Contractor shall obtain bids
from subcontractors and provide Owner with a proposed construction schedule and
a preliminary cost breakdown of the proposed GMP, with reasonably detailed line
items, including the Construction Contingency, Contractor's Fee and Contractor's
General Conditions. The cost breakdown will be divided into line items for
information only; any guarantee applies only to the total amount of the GMP and
Contractor's General Conditions, not to individual line items, subtrade or other
specific element of the work or cost breakdown.

5.2.1.4 Within 15 days after receipt of the proposed GMP and construction
schedule, Owner shall either approve or disapprove of same, in which later case
Owner and Contractor shall meet and confer within 3 days after the contractor'
receipt of the notice of disapproval, Owner may require Contractor to re-bid
selected major subcontracts (i.e., subcontracts for which the total estimate
exceeds $50,000) with designated subcontractors reasonably acceptable to
Contractor, in which event Contractor shall provide Owner with a revised GMP and
construction schedule within 15 days after Owner's request.

5.2.1.5 If the GMP has not been agreed upon within 90 days after the Contractor
has submitted the proposed GMP to the Owner, and work has commenced at the
project site, the project shall continue on a Cost of the Work Plus a Fee basis.

5.2.1.5.1 At any time, with mutual consent of the Owner and Contractor, the
Contract may be converted, in part or in full, to a Fixed Lump Sum.

5.2.1.6 Upon mutual approval of the GMP, Owner and Contractor shall sign a
change order to this Agreement establishing the GMP, attaching the line item
cost breakdown (for information), and identifying the Plans and other Contract
Documents as referenced in Article 15.

5.2.1.7 The GMP will contain a "construction contingency" equal to two percent
(2%) of the estimated cost of the Work, supported by Subcontractor bids to the
extent possible, but not including any subsequent change orders. It is
understood and agreed to by the Contractor and the Owner that the "construction
contingency" has been included for sole use by Contractor to pay any costs (as
described in Article 7 "Costs to be Reimbursed") incurred to complete the scope
of work as defined by the contract documents which were used to establish the
GMP and not subsequent documents. Such "construction contingency" will be deemed

Contractor's use to cover costs intended to be included in the Work, but not
reasonably foreseeable by the Contractor at the time of bidding, including,
without limitations, Change Orders issued due to refinements of details of
design within the scope and standards of quality and quantities shown in Final
Drawings and Specifications for the Work (as opposed to changes in the scope of
the Work), Contractor shall not seek any increase in the GMP (a) on account of
any labor dispute within Contractor's control involving Contractor or
Subcontractors arising during the period the Work is to be performed, (b) by
reason of the breach, fault, neglect, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any failure of
performance not excused hereunder, by Contractor or any Subcontractor, (c) for
costs which are intended to be included in the "construction contingency" or (d)
as a result of the existence of any job site condition which should reasonably
have been discovered or foreseen by Contractor through the exercise of
reasonable diligence.

5.2.1.7.1 The Construction Contingency will be used to pay for added General
Conditions costs due to "normal" weather delays. However, any other costs due to
weather delays will require a change order. For purposes of the foregoing,
"normal" shall be defined as the average number of rainy days (rain exceeding
1/4" per day) during the last 50 years in the City of San Diego during the
period of time directly correlating to the delay period. By way of example, if
the project is delayed by rain for ten days during the month of May and the
average number of rainy days correlating to the period of delay is seven, the
Contractor shall be entitled to General Conditions compensation for three of the
ten days of delay.

5.2.1.8 The "Construction Contingency" shall not be used for changes and/or
additions to the scope of work, as outlined in the contract documents that were
used to establish the GMP, or to pay for costs of items specifically excluded
from the GMP. These items will be covered by separate change order and will
have no effect on the contingency.

5.2.1.9 If any subsequent document, which was not included in the Contract
Documents used to establish the GMP, is issued and contains clarifications
or evolutionary information which creates a cost impact in excess of $2,000
per occurrence shall be deemed to be a change in scope of work, and shall not be
covered or paid for by contingency funds, in whole or in part. The construction
contingency is not to be used to cover costs related to "evolution" of the
contract documents that were used to establish the GMP.

5.2.1.10 Construction contingency funds shall not be used to pay for costs
related to changes or clarifications of the work due to the architect's or
other's errors or omissions or changes and additions required by building
departments, fire departments or other governing agencies. Such costs will be
covered by separate change order.

5.2.1.11 The Guaranteed Maximum Price shall be calculated as the sum of the
following items:

(a) the General Conditions Amount (as adjusted in accordance with this
agreement);

(b) the sum of the fixed lump sum prices for all subcontracts approved by the
Owner;

(c) estimated amounts and/or allowance amounts for cost of work included in the
Contract Documents but not included in Subcontracts;

    by the Owner:
    (State the numbers or other identification of accepted alternates. If

    Price (GMP) is established, and incorporated by Change Order.

    5.2.4.1 Any allowances included in this Contract shall include the estimated
    cost of material, equipment, labor and any other costs required to complete
    the work for which the allowance was established. When the actual cost of
    any allowance item is determined the contract amount will be adjusted by
    Change Order for the difference in actual cost versus the allowance amount.

    5.2.4.2 The GMP shall include an allowance of .25% (.0025) times the total
    cost of the work for anticipated cost of warranty work, to the extent cost
    of same is not included in subcontracts, to be performed after final
    completion and before the end of the one year warranty period. This
    subsection 5.2.4.2 shall not limit Contractor's liability for warranty
    claims.

    5.2.5 Assumptions, if any, on which the Guaranteed Maximum Price is based
    are as follows: To be listed at the time the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP)
    is established, and incorporated by Change Order.

    require further development by the Architect, the Contractor may provide in
    the Guaranteed Maximum Price for such further development consistent with
    the Contract Documents and reasonably inferable therefrom. Such further
    development does not include such things as changes in scope, systems, kinds
    and quality of materials, finishes or equipment, all of which, if required,
    shall be incorporated by Change Order. Cost of such further development will
    be included in the GMP only if clearly and specifically identified and
    priced by Contractor in the Change Order that establishes the GMP.

    Specifications, the Owner will cause the Architect to prepare and deliver to

    revised drawings and specifications ("Supplemental Documents") which shall
    supplement, particularize, refine and detail the Schematic Information as
    necessary to furnish the Contractor with a set of Final Drawings and
    Specifications for the Work. The Contractor shall assist the Owner and the
    Architect in the development of Final Drawings and Specifications by
    reviewing such Supplemental Documents and providing estimates regarding the
    impact of such Supplemental Documents on the time of construction, the cost
    of construction and functional performance. The Contractor shall promptly

    of Supplemental Documents at such meetings, and specific recommendations
    shall be documented as part of the meeting minutes. As Supplemental
    Documents are reviewed and approved, the scope of the Work shall be modified

    scope of the Work set forth in the Schematic Design is not changed to either
    affect GMP or to delay Substantial Completion of the Work without the
    express consent of the Owner.

    5.2.8 Within three (3) weeks after the Final Drawings and Specifications
    have been approved and the building permit for the Work has been obtained,
    the Owner and Contractor shall determine the GMP and document such GMP in a

    5.2.9 No work shall be commenced by the Contractor or its Subcontractors
    without the Owner's written authorization.

ARTICLE 6 CHANGES IN THE WORK

    Articles 5,7 and 8 of this Agreement. Adjustments to subcontracts awarded
    with the Owner's prior consent on the basis of cost plus a fee shall be
    calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, unless the Owner
    has furnished the Contractor with prior written approval of the Form and
    substance of the subcontract, in which case such adjustments shall be
    calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions of that subcontract.

    personnel engaged in direct support of the project stationed at the site or
    off-site.
    (If it is intended that the wages or salaries of certain personnel stationed
    at the Contractor's principal or other offices shall be included in the Cost
    of the Work, identify in Article 14 the personnel to be included and whether

    shall obtain bids. The Contractor shall obtain bids from Subcontractors and

    independently bid any Work which the Contractor intends to "self perform"
    with the exception of work included in Contractor's Fixed General

    Contractor; (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work; and (3)
    has submitted a bid that conforms to the requirements of the Contract
    Documents without reservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that
    another bid be accepted, then the Contractor may require that a Change Order
    be issued to adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference between
    the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Contractor
    and the amount of the subcontract or other agreement actually signed with
    the person or entity designated by the Owner.

    10.3 Subcontracts or other agreements shall conform to the applicable
    payment provisions of this Agreement, and shall not be awarded on the
    basis of cost plus a fee without the prior consent of the Owner.

    10.4 To secure the performance of the Work under this Agreement, Contractor,
    hereby grants a security interest in each of the Subcontracts in favor of

    continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to all of the
    Subcontracts without the signature of Contractor where permitted by law.

    Subcontractors and Suppliers  to keep, full and detailed accounts and
    exercise such controls as may be necessary for proper financial management
    under this Contract, and the accounting and control systems shall be
    satisfactory to the Owner. The Owner and the Owner's accountants and Project
    Lender shall be afforded prompt access to, and shall be permitted to audit
    and copy, the Contractor's and time and materials basis Subcontractor's and
    Supplier records, books, correspondence, instructions, drawings, receipts,
    subcontracts, purchase orders, vouchers, memoranda and other data relating
    to this Contract, and the Contractor and time and materials basis
    Subcontractor's and Supplier shall preserve these for a period of three
    years after final payment, or for such longer period as may be required by
    law. The foregoing shall not apply to Contractor's General Conditions or
    other costs that have been included in the Contract on a fixed lump sum
    basis.

ARTICLE 12 PAYMENTS

    12.1 PROGRESS PAYMENTS

    12.1.1 Based upon Applications for Payment submitted to the Owner or
    Architect by the Contractor and Certificates for Payment issued by the
    Architect, the Owner shall make progress payments on account of the Contract

    values shall allocate the entire Guaranteed Maximum Price among the various
    portions of the Work, except that the Contractor's Fee shall be shown as a
    single separate item. The schedule of values shall be prepared in such form
    and supported by such data to substantiate its accuracy as the Owner or
    Architect may require. This schedule, unless objected to by the Owner or
    Architect, shall be used as a basis for reviewing the Contractor's
    Applications for Payment.

    12.1.6 Applications for Payment shall show the percentage of completion of
    each portion of the Work as of the end of the period covered by the
    Application for Payment. The percentage of completion shall be the lesser of
    (i) the percentage of that portion of the Work which has actually been
    completed; or (2) the percentage obtained by dividing (a) the expense that
    has actually been incurred by the Contractor on account of that portion of
    the Work for which the Contractor has made or intends to make actual payment
    prior to the next Application for Payment by (b) the share of the Guaranteed
    Maximum Price allocated to that portion of the Work in the schedule of
    values.

    12.1.7 Subject to other provisions of the Contract Documents, the amount of
    each progress payment shall be computed as follows:

        .1  take that portion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable
            to completed Work as determined by multiplying the percentage of
            completion of each portion of the Work by the share of the
            Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion of the Work in
            the schedule of values. Pending final determination of cost to the
            Owner of changes in the Work, amounts not in dispute shall be
            included as provided in Subparagraph 7.3.8 of AIA Document
            A201-1997;

        .2  add that portion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable
            to materials and equipment delivered and suitably stored at the site
            for subsequent incorporation in the Work, or if approved in advance
            by the Owner, suitably stored off the site at a location agreed upon
            in writing;

        .3  add the Contractor's Fee, less retainage of ten percent (10%).
            subject to provisions of 12.1.8. The Contractor's Fee shall be
            computed upon the Cost of the Work described in the two preceding
            Clauses at the rate stated in Subparagraph 5.1.2 or, if the
            Contractor's Fee is stated as a fixed sum in that Subparagraph,
            shall be an amount that bears the same ratio to that fixed-sum fee
            as the Cost of the Work in the two preceding Clauses bears to a
            reasonable estimate of the probable Cost of the Work upon its
            completion;

        .4  subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner;

        .5  During the course of construction, each Application for Payment
            shall be subject to a retention of ten percent (10%): however, after
            the Work is fifty percent (50%) complete, and for so long as the
            Contractor is not in default hereunder, no additional retention
            shall be required (after which time the retention shall be and
            remain approximately five percent (5%) of the total Contract sum.)
            In addition to the foregoing, in the event the Contractor retains
            more than ten percent (10%) from disbursements to be made to any
            Subcontractor, the application for payment from the Owner shall be
            subject to a retention in an equal amount.

Contractors of America.

    12.2.1.1 In addition to the actions required for final payment set forth in

    after the later of the actual Substantial Completion Date, execution of
    final Change Orders or Construction Change Directives, completion of punch
    list items, or settlement of any claims, disputes, or litigation, the
    Contractor shall submit a billing statement showing, in such form and detail
    as the Owner shall reasonably require, the aggregate of all reimbursable
    costs paid or then due on account of the Cost of the Work. If the aggregate
    amount is greater than the total previous payments, the Owner will pay the
    balance due within five (5) days of receiving the billing statement. If the
    aggregate amount is less than the total of previous payments, the amount due
    to the Owner will be remitted with the final statement. Additionally, the
    Contractor guarantees to deliver to Owner a "lien free" project evidenced by
    final unconditional releases from all subcontractors used on the project.

    12.2.2 The Owner's final payment to the Contractor shall be made no later
    than 30 days after The actual Substantial Completion Date or constructive
    occupancy, of both buildings whichever occurs first.

    12.2.3 The Owner's accountants will review and report in writing on the
    Contractors final accounting within 30 days after delivery of the final
    accounting to the Owner or Architect by the Contractor. Based upon such
    Cost of the Work as the Owner's accountants report to be substantiated by
    the Contractor's final accounting, and provided the other conditions of
    Subparagraph 12.2.1 have been met, the Owner will, within seven days after
    receipt of the written report of the Owner's accountants, either issue to
    the Contractor a final Payment or notify the Contractor in writing of the
    reasons for withholding payment as provided in Subparagraph 9.5.1 of the AIA
    Document A201-1997. The time periods stated in this Subparagraph 12.2.3
    supersede those stated in Subparagraph 9.4.1 of the AIA Document A201-1997.

    12.2.4 If the Owner's accountants report the Cost of the Work as
    substantiated by the Contractor's final accounting to be more or less than
    claimed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall be entitled to demand
    arbitration of the disputed amount without a further decision of the Owner
    or Architect. Such demand for arbitration shall be made by the Contractor
    within 30 days after the Contractor's receipt of a copy of the Owner's
    Accountants Reports Pending a final resolution by arbitration, the Owner

    12.2.5 If, subsequent to final payment and at the Owner's request, the
    Contractor incurs costs described in Article 7 and not excluded by Article 8
    to correct defective nonconforming, or warranty Work, the Owner shall
    reimburse the Contractor such costs and the Contractor's Fee applicable
    thereto on the same basis as if such costs had been incurred prior to final
    payment, but not in excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price. If the
    Contractor has participated in savings as provided in Paragraph 5.2, the
    amount of such savings shall be recalculated and appropriate credit given to
    the Owner in determining the net amount to be paid by the Owner to the
    Contractor.

    of the Work upon its completion; and

    purchase or rental at the election of the Owner, for any equipment owned by
    the Contractor that the Owner elects to retain and that is not otherwise

    orders (including rental agreements), the Contractor shall, as a condition
    of receiving the payments referred to in this Article 13, execute and
    deliver all such papers and take all such steps, including the legal
    assignment of such subcontracts and other contractual rights of the
    Contractor, as the Owner may require for the purpose of fully vesting in the

    14.6 Other provisions:

    14.6.1 If either party commences a proceeding or action against the other to
    enforce any of the terms of the Contract Documents or because of the breach
    by either party of any of the terms of the Contract Documents, the losing or
    defaulting party shall pay to the prevailing party the actual costs and
    expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution or defense of such
    proceeding or action and any appeals in connection therewith, including
    actual accountants' and attorney's fees. Any arbitration award or final
    judgment or order entered in any such proceedings or action shall contain a
    specific provision providing for the recovery of all costs and expenses of
    suit, including, without limitation, actual attorneys' fees and costs and
    expenses incurred in connection with: (i) enforcing, perfecting and
    executing such judgment; (ii) post-judgment motions; (iii) contempt
    proceedings; (iv) garnishment, levy, and debtor and third-party
    examinations; (v) discovery; and (vi) bankruptcy litigation. The foregoing
    shall be subject to the conditions and limitations stipulated in Paragraph
    14.6.1.1.

    14.6.1.1 Any party filing a complaint or cross complaint to enforce the
    terms or obligations under this Agreement shall be required, at the time of
    filing said complaint or cross-complaint, to serve on the other party of
    this Agreement a Demand for Payment, clearly stating, in a detailed and
    itemized format, all damages, exclusive of attorney and expert fees,
    including those sought under Paragraph 14.6.1 claimed under said complaint
    or cross-complaint, which if accepted by the other party, shall act as a
    full and compete settlement of the action brought by said party. Failure by
    any party to timely serve the Demand for Payment with its complaint or
    cross- complaint shall act as a complete and final waiver of its right to
    any attorney's fees and costs recoverable under Paragraph 14.6.1. If the
    Demand for Payment requirement has been timely met, then the amount of
    attorney's fees and costs recoverable under Paragraph 14.6.1 shall be equal
    to the percentage of damages awarded by the jury, or court, in relation to
    the amount stated in the Demand for Payment. By way of example, if the
    Demand for Payment is in the amount of $100.000.00 and the amount of damages
    awarded the verdict or decision is $50.000.00, then that prevailing party
    shall be entitled to a recovery of 50% of its reasonable attorney's fees and
    costs as post-trail costs under Paragraph 14.6.1.

    14.6.2 The Contractor shall provide to the Owner three (3) copies of a
    complete project closeout manual which shall describe all critical

    product for purposes other than in connection with construction,
    maintenance, and repair of the improvements and other facilities or other
    Work contemplated under this Agreement without the Contractor's knowledge
    and written approval, the Owner will release the Contractor from any

    (hereinafter the Agreement), Conditions of the Contract (General,
    Supplementary and other Conditions), Drawings, Specifications, Addenda
    issued prior to execution of the Contract, other documents listed in the
    Agreement and Modifications issued after execution of the Contract. A
    Modification is (i) a written amendment to the Contract signed by both
    parties, (2) a Change Order, (3) a Construction Change Directive or (4) a
    written order for a minor change in the Work issued by the Architect. Unless
    specifically enumerated in the Agreement, the Contract Documents do not

    invitation to bid, Instructions to Bidders, sample forms, the Contractor's
    bid or portions of Addenda relating to bidding requirements).

    1.1.2 THE CONTRACT

    The Contract Documents form the Contract for Construction. The Contract
    represents the entire and integrated agreement between the parties hereto
    and supersedes prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either
    written or oral. The Contract may be amended or modified only by a

    1.1.4 THE PROJECT

    The Project is the total construction of which the Work performed under the
    Contract Documents may be the whole or a part and which may include
    construction by the Owner or by separate contractors.

    1.1.5 THE DRAWINGS

    The Drawings are the graphic and pictorial portions of the Contract
    Documents showing the design, location and dimensions of the Work, generally
    including plans, elevations, sections, details, schedules and diagrams.

    1.1.6 THE SPECIFICATIONS

    The Specifications are that portion of the Contract Documents consisting of
    the written requirements for materials, equipment, systems, standards and
    workmanship for the Work, and performance of related services.

    1.1.7 THE PROJECT MANUAL

    The Project Manual is a volume assembled for the Work which may include the
    bidding requirements, sample forms, Conditions of the Contract and
    Specifications.

    1.2 CORRELATION AND INTENT OF THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS

    execution and completion of the Work by the Contractor. The Work shall
    consist of all items specifically included in the Contract Documents or
    reasonably inferable therefrom. Reasonably inferable shall not be

    binding as if required by all. All Work shall conform to the Contract
    Documents. No change therefrom shall be made without review and written
    acceptance by the Architect and Owner.

    1.2.2 Organization of the Specifications into divisions, sections and
    articles, and arrangement of Drawings shall not control the Contractor in
    dividing the Work among Subcontractors or in establishing the extent of Work
    to be performed by any trade.

    to affect the interpretation of either statement.

    1.5 EXECUTION OF CONTRACT DOCUMENTS

    1.5.1 The Contract Documents shall be signed by the Owner and Contractor.

    1.5.2 Execution of the Contract by the Contractor is a representation that
    the Contractor has visited the site, become generally familiar with local
    conditions under which the Work is to be performed and correlated personal
    observations with requirements of the Contract Documents. Execution of the
    Agreement by the Contractor is a representation that the preliminary design
    information prepared by the Architect and the preliminary estimate prepared
    by Contractor attached to the Agreement as Schedule are sufficient to have
    enabled the Contractor: (1) to estimate the cost of the Shell/Site
    Improvements and the cost of the Tenant Improvements described therein
    (which collectively comprise the Work): and (2) to enter into the Agreement
    with the understanding that the Schematic Design and the Schedule Estimate
    are sufficient to enable the Contractor to determine its ability to
    construct the Shell/Site Improvements for a Guaranteed Maximum price which
    does not exceed the range of costs specified in the Agreement on or before
    the Substantial Completion Deadline established in the Agreement, except to
    the extent that changes in the scope of the Shell/Site Improvements set
    forth on the Schematic Design and the Schematic Estimate result, in the
    aggregate, in increased costs. Promptly after the Contractor's receipt of
    supplemental design documents during the course of the preparation of the
    Final Drawings and Specifications, with respect to the Shell/Land
    Improvements and the Tenant Improvements, the Contractor shall provide
    prompt notice to the Owner and the Architect regarding the impact of such
    supplemental design documents on construction cost and construction time,
    and whether, in Contractor's opinion, such supplemental design documents
    modify the scope of the work. Owner may direct the Architect to make
    modifications to the design documents in order to meet or maintain the
    Project budget.

    Contractor from its duties under the Contract Documents. The Owner's
    investigations of subsurface characteristics or conditions of the areas
    where the Work is to be performed is provided for use by the Architect and
    the Contractor. However, the Owner does not warrant the sufficiency or
    accuracy of the investigations thus made, the records thereof, or of any
    interpretations set forth therein or made by the Owner or Architect in its
    use thereof, and the Owner makes no warranty or guaranty, either express or
    implied, that the conditions indicated by such investigations are accurate
    or representative of those existing on the Site or adjacent area, or that
    unforeseen developments may not occur, or that materials other than or in
    proportions different from those indicated may not be encountered.
    Contractor shall use its best professional efforts to perform the Work in
    such a manner so as to avoid damaging any and all utility lines, telephone
    company lines and cables, sewer lines, water pipes, gas lines, electrical
    lines, including, without limitation, all buried pipelines and buried
    telephone cables. In the event unanticipated subsurface site conditions are

    Article 7 of these General Conditions.

    2.2.4 Information or services required of the Owner by the Contract
    Documents shall be furnished by the Owner with reasonable promptness. Any

    with the requirements of the Contract Documents as required by Paragraph
    12.2 or persistently fails to carry out Work in accordance with the Contract
    Documents, or fails or refuses to provide a sufficient amount of properly
    supervised and coordinated labor, materials, or equipment so as to be able
    to complete the Work by the Substantial Completion Deadline or permits
    performance of the Work to stop for a period of fifteen (15) days for any
    reason other than force majeure events as set forth in Paragraph 4.2 of the
    Agreement or Owner-caused delay, or fails to remove and discharge (within
    ten (10) days any lien filed upon the Owner's property by anyone claiming
    by, through, or under the Contractor, or disregards the instructions of the
    Architect or Owner when based on the requirements of the Contract Documents,
    the Owner may issue a written order to the Contractor to stop the Work, or
    any portion thereof, until the cause for such order has been eliminated;
    however, the right of the Owner to stop the Work shall not give rise to a
    duty on the part of the Owner to exercise this right for the benefit of the
    Contractor or any other person or entity, except to the extent required by
    Subparagraph 6.1.3.

    2.4 OWNER'S RIGHT TO CARRY OUT THE WORK

    fails within such seven (7) day period to eliminate (or diligently commence
    to eliminate) the cause of any stop work order issued under Subparagraph

    period. If the Contractor within such three-day period after receipt of such
    second notice fails to commence and continue to correct any deficiencies,
    the Owner may, without prejudice to other remedies the Owner may have,

ARTICLE 3 CONTRACTOR

    3.1 GENERAL

    3.1.1 The Contractor is the person or entity identified as such in the
    Agreement and is referred to throughout the Contract Documents as if
    singular in number. The term "Contractor" means the Contractor or the
    Contractor's authorized representative.

    3.1.2 The Contractor shall perform the Work in accordance with the Contract
    Documents.

    3.1.3 The Contractor shall not be relieved of obligations to perform the
    Work in accordance with the Contract Documents either by activities or
    duties of the Architect or by tests, inspections or approvals required or
    performed by persons other than the Contractor.

    3.2 REVIEW OF CONTRACT DOCUMENTS AND FIELD CONDITIONS BY CONTRACTOR

    3.2.1 Since the Contract Documents are complementary, before starting each
    portion of the Work, the Contractor shall, using appropriate care, carefully
    study and compare the various Drawings and other Contract Documents relative
    to that portion of the Work, as well as the information furnished by the
    Owner pursuant to Subparagraph 2.2.3, shall take field measurements of any
    existing conditions related to that portion of the Work and shall observe
    any conditions at the site affecting it. These obligations are for the
    purpose of facilitating construction by the Contractor and are not for the
    purpose of discovering errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in the Contract
    Documents; however, any errors, inconsistencies or omissions discovered by
    the Contractor shall be reported promptly to the Architect and Owner as a
    request for information in such form as the Architect may require. Architect
    and Engineers are preparing all plans, specifications and drawings for the
    Work. As the various portions of the final plans, specifications and
    drawings are completed for the Work, and properly issued to Contractor, the
    same shall be considered a Contract Document. Contractor shall, unless
    otherwise specified, comply with manufacturer's latest printed instructions,
    if any, for materials, supply, storage and installation methods and shall
    notify Owner in writing of any conflict between these specifications and the
    manufacturer's instructions. Owner will designate which document is to be
    followed.

    3.2.2 Any design errors or omissions noted by the Contractor during this
    review shall be reported promptly to the Architect or Owner, but it is
    recognized that the Contractor's review is made in the Contractor's capacity
    as a contractor and not as a licensed design professional unless otherwise
    specifically provided in the Contract Documents. The Contractor is not
    required to ascertain that the Contract Documents are in accordance with
    applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, building codes, and rules and
    regulations, but any nonconformity discovered by or made known to the
    Contractor shall be reported promptly to the Architect and Owner.

    3.2.3 If the Contractor believes that additional cost or time is involved
    because of clarifications or instructions issued by the Architect or Owner
    in response to the Contractor's notices or requests for information pursuant
    to Subparagraphs 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, the Contractor shall make Claims as
    provided in Subparagraphs 4.3.6 and 4.3.7. If the Contractor fails to
    perform the obligations of Subparagraphs 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, the Contractor
    shall pay such costs and damages to the Owner as would have been avoided if
    the Contractor had performed such obligations. The Contractor shall not be
    liable to the Owner or Architect for damages resulting from errors,
    inconsistencies or omissions in the Contract Documents or for differences
    between field measurements or conditions and the Contract Documents unless
    the Contractor recognized such error, inconsistency, omission or difference
    and knowingly failed to report it to the Architect or Owner.

    3.3 SUPERVISION AND CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES

    3.3.1 The Contractor shall supervise and direct the Work, using the
    Contractor's best skill and attention. The Contractor shall be solely
    responsible for and have control over construction means, methods,
    techniques, sequences and procedures and for coordinating all portions of
    the Work under the Contract, unless the Contract Documents give other
    specific instructions concerning these matters. If the Contract Documents
    give specific instructions concerning construction means, methods,
    techniques, sequences or procedures, the Contractor shall evaluate the
    jobsite safety thereof and, except as stated below, shall be fully and
    solely responsible for the jobsite safety of such means, methods,
    techniques, sequences or procedures. If the Contractor determines that such
    means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures may not be safe, the
    Contractor shall give timely written notice to the Architect or Owner and
    shall not proceed with that portion of the Work without further written
    instructions from the Architect or Owner. If the Contractor is then
    instructed to proceed with the required means, methods, techniques,
    sequences or procedures without acceptance of changes proposed by the
    Contractor, the Owner shall be solely responsible for any resulting loss or
    damage. Contractor shall perform the Work in accordance with the Contract
    Documents, and shall cause the Work to be performed by duly qualified and
    licensed personnel of Contractor. Contractor hereby accepts the relationship
    of trust and confidence established by the Agreement and covenants with the
    Owner to cooperate with the architects, engineers, and consultants retained
    by Owner and utilize the Contractor's best skill, efforts and judgment in
    furthering the interests of the Owner; to furnish efficient business
    administration and supervision; to make best efforts to furnish at all times
    and adequate supply of workers and materials; and to perform the Work in the
    best way and most expeditious and economical manner consistent with the
    interests of the Owner. Except as expressly authorized herein, the
    Contractor has no right or authority of any kind to act as the
    representative of or agent of Owner. It is understood and agreed that the
    relationship of Contractor to Owner shall be that of an independent

    3.14 CUTTING AND PATCHING

    3.14.1 The Contractor shall be responsible for cutting, fitting or patching
    required to complete the Work or to make its parts fit together properly.

    3.14.2 The Contractor shall not damage or endanger a portion of the Work or
    fully or partially completed construction of the Owner or separate
    contractors by cutting, patching or otherwise altering such construction, or
    by excavation. The Contractor shall not cut or otherwise alter such
    construction by the Owner or a separate contractor except with written
    consent of the Owner and of such separate contractor; such consent shall not
    be unreasonably withheld. The Contractor shall not unreasonably withhold
    from the Owner or a separate contractor the Contractor's consent to cutting
    or otherwise altering the Work. Contractor shall establish the location and
    extent of service lines in the area of the Work, including calling local
    utilities prior to any digging and immediately notify Owner of Contractor's
    findings, confirming such findings in writing, before commencing Work,
    Contractor must take all precautions to ensure that there are no unknown
    service lines; where Work involves breaking into or connecting to existing
    services, carry out Work at times directed by Owner; and record locations,
    including elevations, of maintained rerouted and abandoned service lines.

    3.15 CLEANING UP

    3.15.1 The Contractor shall keep the premises and surrounding area free from
    accumulation of waste materials or rubbish caused by operations under the
    Contract. At completion of the Work, the Contractor shall remove from and
    about the Project waste materials, rubbish, the Contractor's tools,
    construction equipment, machinery and surplus materials.

    3.15.2 If the Contractor fails to clean up as provided in the Contract
    Documents, the Owner may do so and the cost thereof shall be charged to the
    Contractor.

    3.16 ACCESS TO WORK

    3.16.1 The Contractor shall provide the Owner and Architect access to the
    Work in preparation and progress wherever located.

    3.16.2 All materials and equipment furnished and Work performed must be

    also be subject to further inspection by Owner or its authorized
    representatives, which representatives shall be afforded full and free
    access to places of business of Contractor and its Subcontractors and
    suppliers for such further inspection. Contractor shall provide safe and
    adequate facilities, Drawings, documents and samples as requested, and
    provide assistance, access and cooperation, including stoppage of Work, to
    perform such examination as may be necessary to determine compliance with
    the requirements of the Contract Documents. Any Work covered prior to any
    inspection or test by Owner which was required to have been witnessed by
    Owner by either Contract Documents or by Owner's prior written notice, shall
    be uncovered and replaced at the expense of Contractor. Failure of Owner to
    make such further inspection to discover defective design, materials, or
    workmanship shall not relieve Contractor of its obligations to reject or
    require the correction of defective Work in accordance with the provisions
    of the Contract Documents.

    3.16.3 If any Work is determined by Owner to be defective or not in
    conformance with the Contract Documents. Contractor shall be notified in
    writing and shall, at Contractor's expense, immediately remove and replace
    or correct such defective Work. If Owner prefers to accept Work that is not

    replacement or correction, in which case the Contract sum shall be reduced
    as appropriate and equitable. Such adjustment shall be effected whether or
    not final payment has been made, and if so, Contractor shall immediately pay
    to Owner the amount of such adjustment.

    3.17 ROYALTIES, PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS

    3.17.1 The Contractor shall pay all royalties and license fees. The
    Contractor shall defend suits or claims for infringement of copyrights and
    patent rights and shall hold the Owner and Architect harmless from loss on
    account thereof, but shall not be responsible for such defense or loss when
    a particular design, process or product of a particular manufacturer or
    manufacturers is required by the Contract Documents or where the copyright
    violations are contained in Drawings, Specifications or other documents
    prepared by the Owner or Architect. However, if the Contractor has knowledge
    that the required design, process or product is an infringement of a
    copyright or a patent, the Contractor shall be responsible for such loss
    unless such information is promptly furnished to the Architect or Owner.

    3.18 INDEMNIFICATION

    3.18.1 To the fullest extent permitted by law the Contractor shall indemnify
    and hold harmless the Owner, Development Manager, Project Lender and their
    agents and employees of any of them from and against claims, damages, losses
    and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, arising out of
    or resulting from performance of the Work, provided that such claim,
    damage, loss or expense is attributable to bodily injury, sickness,
    disease or death, or to injury to or destruction of tangible property (other
    than the Work itself), but only to the extent caused by the negligent acts
    or omissions of the Contractor, a Subcontractor, anyone directly or
    indirectly employed by them or anyone for whose acts they may be liable,
    regardless of whether or not such claim, damage, loss or expense is caused
    in part by a party indemnified hereunder. Such obligation shall not be
    construed to negate, abridge, or reduce other rights or obligations of
    indemnity which would otherwise exist as to a party or person described in
    this Paragraph 3.18.

    3.18.2 In claims against any person or entity indemnified under this
    Paragraph 3.18 by an employee of the Contractor, a Subcontractor, anyone
    directly or indirectly employed by them or anyone for whose acts they may be
    liable, the indemnification obligation under Subparagraph 3.18.1 shall not
    be limited by a limitation on amount or type of damages, compensation or
    benefits payable by or for the Contractor or a Subcontractor under workers'
    compensation acts, disability benefit acts or other employee benefit acts.

    4.1.3 If the employment of the Architect is terminated, the Owner shall
    employ a new Architect against whom the Contractor has no reasonable
    objection and whose status under the Contract Documents shall be that of the
    former Architect.

    4.2 ARCHITECT'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE CONTRACT

    4.2.1 The Architect will provide assistance in the administration of the
    Contract as described in the Contract Documents. The Architect will have
    authority to act on behalf of the Owner only to the extent provided in the
    Contract Documents, unless otherwise modified in writing in accordance with
    other provisions of the Contract.

    4.2.2 The Architect, as a representative of the Owner, will visit the site
    at intervals appropriate to the stage of the Contractor's operations (1) to
    become generally familiar with and to keep the Owner informed about the
    progress and quality of the portion of the Work completed, (2) to endeavor
    to guard the Owner against defects and deficiencies in the Work, and (3) to
    determine in general if the Work is being performed in a manner indicating
    that the Work, when fully completed, will be in accordance with the Contract
    Documents. However, the Architect will not be required to make exhaustive or
    continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or quantity of the Work.
    The Architect will neither have control over or charge of, nor be
    responsible for, the construction means, methods, techniques, sequences or
    procedures, or for the safety precautions and programs in connection with
    the Work, since these are solely the Contractor's rights and
    responsibilities under the Contract Documents, except as provided in
    Subparagraph 3.3.1.

    4.2.3 The Architect will not be responsible for the Contractor's failure to
    perform the Work in accordance with the requirements of the Contract
    Documents. The Architect will not have control over or charge of and will
    not be responsible for acts or omissions of the Contractor, Subcontractors,
    or their agents or employees, or any other persons or entities performing
    portions of the Work.

    4.2.4 Communications Facilitating Contract Administration. Except as
    otherwise provided in the Contract Documents or when direct communications
    have been specially authorized, the Owner and Contractor shall endeavor to
    communicate with each other through the Architect about matters arising out
    of or relating to the Contract. Communications by and with the Architect's
    consultants shall be through the Architect. Communications by and with
    Subcontractors and material suppliers shall be through the Contractor.
    Communications by and with separate contractors shall be through the Owner.

    4.2.5 Based on the Architect's evaluations of the Contractor's Applications
    for Payment, the Architect will review and certify the amounts due the
    Contractor and will issue Certificates for Payment in such amounts.

    4.2.6 The Architect will have authority to recommend that the Owner reject
    Work that does not conform in the Architect's opinion to the Contract
    Documents. Whenever the Architect considers it necessary or advisable, the
    Architect will have authority to recommend inspection or testing of the Work
    in accordance with Subparagraphs 13.5.2 and 13.5.3, whether or not such Work
    is fabricated, installed or completed. However, neither this authority of
    the Architect nor a decision made in good faith either to exercise or not to
    exercise such authority shall give rise to a duty or responsibility of the
    Architect to the Contractor, Subcontractors, material and equipment
    suppliers, their agents or employees, or other persons or entities
    performing portions of the Work.

    4.2.7 The Architect will review and approve or take other appropriate action
    upon the Contractor's submittals such as Shop Drawings, Product Data and
    Samples, but only for the limited purpose of checking for conformance with
    information given and the design concept expressed in the Contract
    Documents. The Architect's action will be taken with such reasonable
    promptness as to cause no delay in the Work or in the activities of the
    Owner, Contractor or separate contractors, while allowing sufficient time in
    the Architect's professional judgment to permit adequate review. Review of
    such submittals is not conducted for the purpose of determining the accuracy
    and completeness of other details such as dimensions and quantities, or for
    substantiating instructions for installation or performance of equipment or
    systems, all of which remain the responsibility of the Contractor as
    required by the Contract Documents. The Architect's review of the
    Contractor's submittals shall not relieve the Contractor of the obligations
    under Paragraphs 3.3, 3.5 and 3.12. The Architect's review shall not
    constitute approval of safety precautions or, unless otherwise specifically
    stated by the Architect, of any construction means, methods, techniques,
    sequences or procedures. The Architect's approval of a specific item shall
    not indicate approval of an assembly of which the item is a component.

    4.2.8 The Architect or Owner will prepare Change Orders and Construction
    Change Directives, and may authorize minor changes in the Work as provided
    in Paragraph 7.4. All Change Orders, Construction Directives, and field
    directives shall require the approval of the Owner in writing to be binding
    on the Owner.

    4.2.9 The Architect or Owner will conduct inspections to determine the date
    or dates of Substantial Completion and the date of final completion, will
    receive and forward to the Owner, for the Owner's review and records,
    written warranties and related documents required by the Contract and
    assembled by the Contractor, and will issue a final Certificate for Payment
    upon compliance with the requirements of the Contract Documents.

    4.2.10 If the Owner and Architect agree, the Architect will provide one or
    more project representatives to assist in carrying out the Architect's
    responsibilities at the site. The duties, responsibilities and limitations
    of authority of such project representatives shall be as set forth in an
    exhibit to be incorporated in the Contract Documents.

    4.2.11 The Architect will review and make recommendations regarding matters
    concerning performance under and requirements of, the Contract Documents on
    written request of either the Owner or Contractor. The Architect's response
    to such requests will be made in writing within any time limits agreed upon
    or otherwise with reasonable promptness. If no agreement or request is made
    concerning the time within which interpretations required of the Architect
    shall be furnished in compliance with this Paragraph 4.2, then delay shall
    not be recognized on account of failure by the Architect to furnish such
    interpretations until 15 days after written request is made for them.

    4.2.12 Interpretations and decisions of the Architect will be consistent
    with the intent of and reasonably inferable from the Contract Documents and
    will be in writing or in the form of drawings. When making such
    interpretations and initial decisions, the Architect will endeavor to secure
    faithful performance by both Owner and Contractor, will not show partiality
    to either and will not be liable for results of interpretations or decisions
    so rendered in good faith.

    4.2.13

    In reviewing the quality and progress of the Work and submittals received
    from the Contractor, the Architect is acting solely for the convenience of
    the Owner. Neither the Owner nor Architect has any responsibility to assist
    the Contractor in the supervision or performance of the Work. Unless
    otherwise expressly agreed in

    writing by the Owner in each instance, no approval as to any matter by the
    Owner or Architect shall in any way relieve the Contractor from its
    responsibility for the performance of the Work in strict accordance with the
    Contract Documents, except to the extent such approval is incorporated into
    a Change Order approved by Owner.

    4.3 CLAIMS AND DISPUTES

    4.3.1 Definition. A Claim is a demand or assertion by one of the parties
    seeking, as a matter of right, adjustment or interpretation of Contract
    terms, payment of money, extension of time or other relief with respect to
    the terms of the Contract. The term "Claim" also includes other disputes and
    matters in question between the Owner and Contractor arising out of or
    relating to the Contract. Claims must be initiated by written notice. The
    responsibility to substantiate Claims shall rest with the party making the
    Claim.

    4.3.2 Time Limits on Claims. Claims by either party must be initiated within
    21 days after occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claim or within 21
    days after the claimant first recognizes the condition giving rise to the
    Claim, whichever is later. Claims must be initiated by written notice to the
    Architect or Owner and the other party. For clarification of the foregoing,
    constructive notification by the claimant of the possibility of a claim to
    the other party, shall constitute initiation of the claim in satisfaction of
    the 21 day time limitation.

    4.3.3 Continuing Contract Performance. Pending final resolution of a Claim
    except as otherwise agreed in writing or as provided in Subparagraph 9.7.1
    and Article 14, the Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of
    the Contract and the Owner shall continue to make payments in accordance
    with the Contract Documents.

    4.3.4 Claims for Concealed or Unknown Conditions. If conditions are
    encountered at the site which are (1) subsurface or otherwise concealed
    physical conditions which differ materially from those indicated in the
    Contract Documents or (2) unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature,
    which differ materially from those ordinarily found to exist and generally
    recognized as inherent in construction activities of the character provided
    for in the Contract Documents, then notice by the observing party shall be
    given to the other party promptly before conditions are disturbed and in no
    event later than 21 days after first observance of the conditions. The
    Architect or Owner as determined by the Owner will promptly investigate such
    conditions and, if they differ materially and cause an increase or decrease
    in the Contractor's cost of, or time required for, performance of any part
    of the Work, will recommend an equitable adjustment in the Contract Sum or
    Contract Time, or both. If the Architect or Owner determines that the
    conditions at the site are not materially different from those indicated in
    the Contract Documents and that no change in the terms of the Contract is
    justified, the Architect or Owner shall so notify the Contractor in writing,
    stating the reasons. Claims by either party in opposition to such
    determination must be made within 21 days after the Architect or Owner has
    given notice of the decision. If the conditions encountered are materially
    different, the Contract Sum and Contract Time shall be equitably adjusted,
    but if the Owner and Contractor cannot agree on an adjustment in the
    Contract Sum or Contract Time, the adjustment shall be referred to the
    Architect for initial review, subject to further proceedings pursuant to
    Paragraph 4.4. No adjustment in the Contract Time or Contract Sum shall be
    permitted, however, in connection with a concealed or unknown condition that
    does not differ materially from those conditions disclosed or that
    reasonably should have been disclosed by the Contractor's (i) prior
    inspections, reviews, and preconstruction services for the Project, or (ii)
    inspections, tests, reviews, and preconstruction services that the
    Contractor bad the opportunity to make or should have performed in
    connection with the Project.

Contractors of America.

    4.3.5 Claims for Additional Cost. If the Contractor wishes to make Claim for
    an increase in the Contract Sum, written notice as provided herein shall be
    given before proceeding to execute the Work. Prior notice is not required
    for Claims relating to an emergency endangering life or property arising
    under Paragraph 10.6. The Claim Notice shall itemize all claims and shall
    contain sufficient detail and substantiating data to permit evaluation of
    same by the Owner and Architect. No such claim shall be valid unless so
    made. Any change in the Contract Sum resulting from such claim shall be
    authorized by Change Order or Construction Change Directive, as the case may
    be.

    4.3.6 If the Contractor believes additional cost is involved for reasons
    including but not limited to (1) a written interpretation from the
    Architect, (2) an order by the Owner to stop the Work where the Contractor
    was not at fault, (3) a written order for a minor change in the Work issued
    by the Architect, (4) failure of payment by the Owner, (5) termination of
    the Contract by the Owner, (6) Owner's suspension or (7) other reasonable
    grounds, Claim shall be filed in accordance with this Paragraph 4.3.

    4.3.7 Claims for Additional Time

    4.3.7.1 If the Contractor wishes to make Claim for an increase in the
    Contract Time, written notice as provided herein shall be given. The
    Contractor's Claim may include an estimate of cost and of probable effect of
    delay on progress of the Work. In the case of a continuing delay only one
    Claim is necessary.

    4.3.7.2 If adverse weather conditions are the basis for a Claim for
    additional time, such Claim shall be documented by data substantiating that
    weather conditions had an adverse effect on the scheduled construction.

    4.3.8 Injury or Damage to Person or Property. If either party to the
    Contract suffers injury or damage to person or property because of an act or
    omission of the other party, or of others for whose acts such party is
    legally responsible, written notice of such injury or damage, whether or not
    insured, shall be given to the other party within a reasonable time not
    exceeding 21 days after discovery. The notice shall provide sufficient
    detail to enable the other party to investigate the matter.

    4.3.9 If unit prices are stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently
    agreed upon, and if quantities originally contemplated are materially
    changed in a proposed Change Order or Construction Change Directive so that
    application of such unit prices to quantities of Work proposed will cause
    substantial inequity to the Owner or Contractor, the applicable unit prices
    shall be equitably adjusted.

    4.3.10 Claims for Consequential Damages. The Contractor and Owner waive
    Claims against each other for consequential damages arising out of or
    relating to this Contract. This mutual waiver includes:

        .1  damages incurred by the Owner for rental expenses, for losses of
            use, income, profit, financing, business and reputation, and for
            loss of management or employee productivity or of the services of
            such persons; and

        .2  damages incurred by the Contractor for principal office expenses
            including the compensation of personnel stationed there, for losses
            of financing, business and reputation, and for loss of profit except
            anticipated profit arising directly from the Work.

    damages due to either party's termination in accordance with Article 14.

    shall be deemed to preclude an award of liquidated direct damages, when
    applicable, in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents.

    In no event shall either party be liable to the other for special, indirect
    or consequential damages, including damages for economic loss, such as
    business interruption or loss of profits, however the same may be caused,
    including, without limitation, the fault, breach of contract, tort
    (including the concurrent or sole and exclusive negligence), strict
    liability or otherwise of the other party.

    4.4 RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS AND DISPUTES

    4.4.1 Decision of Architect or Owner. Claims, including those alleging an
    error or omission by the Architect shall be referred initially to the
    Architect or Owner for decision. An initial decision by the Architect, or
    Owner shall be required as a condition precedent to mediation, arbitration
    or litigation of all Claims between the Contractor and Owner arising prior
    to the date final payment is due, unless 30 days have passed after the Claim
    has been referred to the Architect or Owner with no decision having been
    rendered by the Owner or Architect. The Architect will not decide disputes
    between the Contractor and persons or entities or the Owner.

    4.4.2 The Architect or Owner will review Claims and within ten days of the
    receipt of the Claim take one or more of the following actions: (1) request
    additional supporting data from the claimant or a response with supporting
    data from the other party, (2) reject the Claim in whole or in part, (3)
    approve the Claim, (4) suggest a compromise, or (5) advise the parties that
    the Architect or Owner is unable to resolve the Claim if the Architect or
    Owner lacks sufficient information to evaluate the merits of the Claim or if
    the Architect or Owner concludes that, in the Architect's or Owner's sole
    discretion, it would be inappropriate for the Owner or Architect to resolve
    the Claim.

    4.4.2.1 The Owner or Architect shall provide the Contractor with written
    response and explanation in support of their selected action to each claim.

    4.4.3 In evaluating Claims, the Architect or Owner may, but shall not be
    obligated to, consult with or seek information from either party or from
    persons with special knowledge or expertise who may assist the Architect or
    Owner in rendering a decision. The Architect may request the Owner to
    authorize retention of such persons at the Owner's expense.

    4.4.4 If the Architect or Owner requests a party to provide a response to a
    Claim or to furnish additional supporting data, such party shall respond,
    within ten days after receipt of such request, and shall either provide a
    response on the requested supporting data, advise the Architect or Owner
    when the response or supporting data will be furnished or advise the
    Architect or Owner that no supporting data will be furnished. Upon receipt
    of the response or supporting data, if any, the Architect or Owner will
    either reject or approve the Claim in whole or in part.

    4.4.5 The Architect or Owner will approve or reject Claims by written
    decision, which shall state the reasons therefor and which shall notify the
    parties of any change in the Contract Sum or Contract Time or both. The
    approval or rejection of a Claim by the Architect or Owner shall be final
    and binding on the parties but subject to litigation.

    4.4.6 When a written decision of the Architect or Owner states that (1) the
    decision is final but subject to litigation and (2) a demand for arbitration
    of a Claim covered by such decision must be made within 30 days after the
    date on which the party making the demand receives the final written
    decision, then failure to

    Architect's or Owner's decision becoming final and binding upon the Owner
    and Contractor. If the Architect or Owner renders a decision after
    litigation has commenced, such decision may be entered as evidence, but
    shall not supersede arbitration proceedings unless the decision is
    acceptable to all parties concerned.

    4.4.7 Upon receipt of a Claim against the Contractor or at any time
    thereafter, the Architect or the Owner may, but is not obligated to, notify
    the surety, if any, of the nature and amount of the Claim. If the Claim
    relates to a possibility of a Contractor's default, the Architect or the
    Owner may, but is not obligated to, notify the surety and request the
    surety's assistance in resolving the controversy.

    4.4.8 If a Claim relates to or is the subject of a mechanic's lien, the
    party asserting such Claim may proceed in accordance with applicable law to
    comply with the lien notice or filing deadlines prior to resolution of the
    Claim by the Architect or Owner, by mediation or by arbitration.

ARTICLE 5 SUBCONTRACTORS

    5.1 DEFINITIONS

    5.1.1 A Subcontractor is a person or entity who has a direct contract with
    the Contractor to perform a portion of the Work at the site. The term
    "Subcontractor" is referred to throughout the Contract Documents as if
    singular in number and means a Subcontractor or an authorized representative
    of the Subcontractor. The term "Subcontractor" does not include a separate
    contractor or subcontractors of a separate contractor.

    5.1.2 A Sub-subcontractor is a person or entity who has a direct or indirect
    contract with a Subcontractor to perform a portion of the Work at the site.
    The term "Sub-subcontractor" is referred to throughout the Contract
    Documents as if singular in number and means a Sub subcontractor or an
    authorized representative of the Sub-subcontractor.

    5.2 AWARD OF SUBCONTRACTS AND OTHER CONTRACTS FOR PORTIONS OF THE WORK

    5.2.1 Unless otherwise stated in the Contract Documents or the bidding
    requirements, the Contractor, as soon as practicable after award of the
    Contract, shall furnish in writing to the Owner through the Architect or
    Owner the names of persons or entities (including those who are to furnish
    materials or equipment fabricated to a special design) proposed for each
    principal portion of the Work. The Architect will promptly reply to the
    Contractor in writing stating whether or not the Owner or the Architect,
    after due investigation, has reasonable objection to any such proposed
    person or entity. Failure of the Owner or Architect to reply promptly shall
    constitute notice of no reasonable objection.

Contractors of America.

    5.2.2 The Contractor shall not contract with a proposed person or entity to
    whom the Owner or Architect has made reasonable and timely objection. The
    Contractor shall not be required to contract with anyone to whom the
    Contractor has made reasonable objection.

    5.2.3 If the Owner or Architect has reasonable objection to a person or
    entity proposed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall propose another to
    whom the Owner or Architect has no reasonable objection. If the proposed but
    rejected Subcontractor was reasonably capable of performing the Work, the
    Contract Sum and Contract Time shall be increased or decreased by the
    difference, if any, occasioned by such change, and an appropriate Change
    Order shall be issued before commencement of the substitute Subcontractor's
    Work. However, no increase in the Contract Sum or Contract Time shall be
    allowed for such change unless the Contractor has acted promptly and
    responsively in submitting names as required.

    5.2.4 The Contractor shall not change a Subcontractor, person or entity
    previously selected if the Owner or Architect makes reasonable objection to
    such substitute.

    5.3 SUBCONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

    5.3.1 By appropriate written agreement the Contractor shall require each
    Subcontractor, to the extent of the Work to be performed by the
    Subcontractor, to be bound to the Contractor by terms of the Contract
    Documents, and to assume toward the Contractor all the obligations and
    responsibilities, for including the responsibility for safety of the
    Subcontractor's Work, which the Contractor, by these Documents, assumes
    toward the Owner and Architect. Each subcontract agreement shall preserve
    and protect the rights of the Owner and Architect under the Contract
    Documents with respect to the Work to be performed by the Subcontractor so
    that subcontracting thereof will not prejudice such rights, and shall allow
    to the Subcontractor, unless specifically provided otherwise in the
    subcontract agreement, the benefit of all rights, remedies and redress
    against the Contractor that the Contractor, by the Contract Documents, has
    against the Owner. Where appropriate, the Contractor shall require each
    Subcontractor to enter into similar agreements with Sub-subcontractors. The
    Contractor shall make available to each proposed Subcontractor, prior to the
    execution of the subcontract agreement, copies of the Contract Documents to
    which the Subcontractor will be bound, and, upon written request of the
    Subcontractor, identify to the Subcontractor terms and conditions of the
    proposed subcontract agreement which may be at variance with the Contract
    Documents. Subcontractors will similarly make copies of applicable portions
    of such documents available to their respective proposed Sub-
    subcontractors.

    5.4 CONTINGENT ASSIGNMENT OF SUBCONTRACTS

    5.4.1 Each subcontract agreement for a portion of the Work is assigned by
    the Contractor to the Owner provided that:

            .1  assignment is effective only after termination of the Contract
                by the Owner for cause pursuant to Paragraph 14.2 and only for
                those subcontract agreements which the Owner accepts by
                notifying the Subcontractor and Contractor in writing; and

            .2  assignment is subject to the prior rights of the surety, if any,
                obligated under bond relating to the Contract.

            .3  All subcontract agreements and purchase orders shall provide
                that they are freely assignable by the Contractor to Owner and
                any Lender, and every subcontract shall be written to provide
                that Owner shall be a third- part beneficiary of the guarantee
                of materials and workmanship, and free assignability thereof by
                Owner. It is further agreed and understood that such right of
                assignment is part of the consideration to the Owner for

ARTICLE 6 CONSTRUCTION BY OWNER OR BY SEPARATE CONTRACTORS

    6.1 OWNER'S RIGHT TO PERFORM CONSTRUCTION AND TO AWARD SEPARATE CONTRACTS

    6.1.1 The Owner reserves the right to perform construction or operations
    related to the Project with the Owner's own forces, and to award separate
    contracts in connection with other portions of the Project or other
    construction or operations on the site under Conditions of the Contract
    identical or substantially similar to these including those portions related
    to insurance and waiver of subrogation, and to schedule its work, and to
    cause Contractor to schedule the Work, in such a manner as will minimize the
    interference between Owner's Work and Contractor's Work, and Contractor
    shall cooperate with the persons performing such concurrent activities at
    the site. If the Contractor claims that delay or additional cost is involved
    because of such action by the Owner, the Contractor shall make such Claim as
    provided in Paragraph 4.3.

    6.1.2 When separate contracts are awarded for different portions of the
    Project or other construction or operations on the site, the term
    "Contractor" in the Contract Documents in each case shall mean the
    Contractor who executes each separate Owner-Contractor Agreement.

    6.1.3 The Owner shall provide for coordination of the activities of the
    Owner's own forces and of each separate contractor with the Work of the
    Contractor, who shall cooperate with them. The Contractor shall participate
    with other separate contractors and the Owner in reviewing their
    construction schedules when directed to do so. The Contractor shall make any
    revisions to the construction schedule deemed necessary after a joint review
    and mutual agreement. The construction schedules shall then constitute the
    schedules to be used by the Contractor, separate contractors and the Other
    until subsequently revised.

    6.1.4 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, when the Owner
    performs construction or operations related to the Project with the Owner's
    own forces, the Owner shall be deemed to be subject to the same obligations
    and to have the same rights which apply to the Contractor under the
    Conditions of the Contract, including, without excluding others, those
    stated in Article 3, this Article 6 and Articles 10,11 and 12.

    6.2 MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY

    6.2.1 The Contractor shall afford the Owner and separate contractors
    reasonable opportunity for introduction and storage of their materials and
    equipment and performance of their activities, and shall connect and
    coordinate the Contractor's construction and operations with theirs as
    required by the Contract Documents.

    6.2.2 If part of the Contractor's Work depends for proper execution or
    results upon construction or operations by the Owner or a separate
    contractor, the Contractor shall, prior to proceeding with that portion of
    the Work, promptly report to the Owner or Architect apparent discrepancies
    or defects in such other construction that would render it unsuitable for
    such proper execution and results. Failure of the Contractor so to report
    shall constitute an acknowledgment that the Owner's or separate contractor's
    completed or partially completed construction is fit and proper to receive
    the Contractor's Work, except as to defects not then reasonably
    discoverable.

    7.3.1 A Construction Change Directive is a written order prepared by the
    Architect or Owner and signed by the Owner, directing a change in the Work
    prior to agreement on adjustment, if any, in the Contract Sum or Contract
    Time, or both. The Owner may by Construction Change Directive, without
    invalidating the Contract, order changes in the Work within the general
    scope of the Contract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions,
    the Contract Sum and Contract Time being adjusted accordingly. Except as
    permitted in Paragraph 7.3 and Subparagraph 9.7.2, a change in the Contract
    Sum or the Contract Time shall be accomplished only by Change Order.
    Accordingly, no course of conduct or dealings between the parties, nor
    express or implied acceptance of alterations or additions to the Work, and
    no claim that Owner has been unjustly enriched by any alteration of or
    addition to the Work, whether or not there is, in fact, an unjust enrichment
    to the Work, shall be the basis of any claim to an increase in any amounts
    due under the Contract Documents or a change in any time period provided for
    in the Contract Documents.

    7.3.2 A Construction Change Directive shall be used in the absence of total
    agreement on the terms of a Change Order.

    7.3.3 If the Construction Change Directive provides for an adjustment to the
    Contract Sum, the adjustment shall be based on one of the following methods:

            .1  mutual acceptance of a lump sum properly itemized and supported
                by sufficient substantiating data to permit evaluation;

            .2  unit prices stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently
                agreed upon;

            .3  cost to be determined in a manner agreed upon by the parties and
                a mutually acceptable fixed or percentage fee; or

            .4  as provided in Subparagraph 7.3.6.

    7.3.4 Upon receipt of a Construction Change Directive, the Contractor shall
    promptly proceed with the change in the Work involved and advise the owner
    of the Contractor's agreement or disagreement with the method, if any,
    provided in the Construction Change Directive for determining the proposed
    adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time.

    7.3.5 A Construction Change Directive signed by the Contractor indicates the
    agreement of the Contractor therewith, including adjustment in Contract Sum
    and Contract Time or the method for determining them. Such agreement shall
    be effective immediately and shall be recorded as a Change Order.

    7.3.6 If the Contractor does not respond promptly or disagrees with the
    method for adjustment in the Contract Sum, the method and the adjustment
    shall be determined by the Architect or Owner on the basis of reasonable
    expenditures and savings of those performing the Work attributable to the
    change, including, in case of an increase in the Contract Sum, Contractor's
    Fee in the amount set forth in Section 5.1.2.1 of this Agreement. In such
    case, and also under Clause 7.3.3.3, the Contractor shall keep and present,
    in such form as the Architect or Owner may prescribe, an itemized accounting
    together with appropriate supporting data. Unless otherwise provided in the
    Contract Documents, costs for the purposes of this Subparagraph 7.3.6 shall
    be limited to the following:

            .1  costs of labor to the extent directly attributable to the
                change, including ' social security, old age and unemployment
                insurance, fringe benefits required by agreement or custom, and
                workers' compensation insurance;

            .2  costs of materials, supplies and equipment, including cost of
                transportation, whether incorporated or consumed;

    7.3.7 The amount of credit to be allowed by the Contractor to the Owner for
    a deletion or change which results in a net decrease in the Contract Sum

    Directive to the Owner, amounts not in dispute for such changes in the Work
    shall be included in Applications for Payment accompanied by a Change Order
    indicating the parties' agreement with part or all of such costs. For any
    portion of such cost that remains in dispute, the Owner or Architect will
    make an interim determination for purposes of monthly certification for
    payment for those costs. That determination of cost shall adjust the
    Contract Sum on the same basis as a Change Order, subject to the right of
    either party to disagree and assert a claim in accordance with Article 4.

    7.3.9 When the Owner and Contractor agree with the recommendations made by
    the Architect concerning the adjustments in the Contract Sum and Contract
    Time, or otherwise reach agreement upon the adjustments, such agreement
    shall be effective < immediately and shall be recorded by preparation and
    execution of an appropriate Change Order.

    not involving adjustment in the Contract Sum or extension of the Contract
    Time and not inconsistent with the intent of the Contract Documents. Such
    changes shall be effected by written order and shall be binding on the Owner
    and Contractor. The Contractor shall carry out such written orders promptly.

    7.4.2. The Owner will have authority to order minor changes in the Work not
    involving adjustment in the Contract sum or extension of the Substantial
    Completion Deadline and not inconsistent with the intent of the Contract
    Documents. Such changes shall be administered in accordance with the
    procedures set forth in Paragraph 7.3 hereof, except that a Construction
    Change Directive issued to the Contractor pursuant to this Subparagraph
    7.4.2 may or may not be signed by the Architect.

     calendar day unless otherwise specifically defined.

     8.2          PROGRESS AND COMPLETION

     instruction of the Owner in writing, prematurely commence operations on the
     site or elsewhere prior to the effective date of insurance required by

     commencement of the Work shall not be changed by the effective date of such
     insurance. Unless the date of commencement is established by the Contract
     Documents or a notice to proceed given by the Owner, the Contractor shall
     notify the Owner in writing not less than five days or other agreed period
     before commencing the Work to permit the timely filing of mortgages,

     attributable to any error, omission, neglect or delay of Contractor or
     Subcontractor, including, but not limited to, any act, neglect, delay or
     default of the Owner or Architect, or any employee or representative of
     either of them, or by any separate contractor employed by the Owner, or by
     any act of the City or other governmental authority not attributable to any
     error, omission, neglect or delay by the Contractor or any Subcontractor,
     or by any changes or additions to the Work, or by injunction or by
     government restrictions or regulations, or by any delay caused by common
     carrier on land or water not reasonably foreseeable by the Contractor, or
     by shortages of labor or materials not reasonably foreseeable by the
     Contractor, or by damage or delay which may arise through or by fire,
     explosion, lightning, earthquake, cyclone, inclement weather, flood,
     insurrection or war, or by the abandonment of the Work by strikes,
     boycotts, or by lockouts engaged thereon through no fault of the Contractor
     or any Subcontractor, or any other causes beyond the Contractor's control,
     then the Contractor shall not be held responsible or accountable for such
     delay and the Contractor shall have the right to submit a claim for
     additional time or additional direct costs, including General Condition
     Costs, or both, in accordance with the applicable provisions of General
     Conditions paragraph 4.3.

     8.3.2        Claims relating to time shall be made in accordance with

     Documents shall be the Contractor's sole remedy for delay (except for the

     Contractor's notice to the Owner of such interference. The Owner's exercise
     of any of its rights under the Agreement, including, without limitation,

     Orders, regardless of the extent or number Of such Changes, or the Owner's
     exercise of any of its remedies of suspension of the Work, or requirement
     of correction or re-execution of any defective Work, shall not under any
     circumstances be construed as intentional interference with the
     Contractor's performance of the Work.

ARTICLE 9 PAYMENTS AND COMPLETION

     9.1          CONTRACT SUM

     9.1.1        The Contract Sum is stated in the Agreement and, including
     authorized adjustments, is the total amount payable by the Owner to the
     Contractor for performance of the Work under the Contract Documents.

     9.2          SCHEDULE OF VALUES

     9.2.1        Before the first Application for Payment, the Contractor shall
     submit to the Owner or Architect a schedule of values allocated to various
     portions of the Work, prepared in such form and supported by such data to
     substantiate its accuracy This schedule, unless objected to, shall be used
     as a basis for reviewing the Contractor's Applications for Payment.

     9.3          APPLICATIONS FOR PAYMENT

     9.3.1        At least ten days before the date established for each
     progress payment, the Contractor shall submit to the Owner an itemized
     Application for Payment for operations completed in accordance with the
     schedule of values.

     9.3.1.1      As provided in Subparagraph 7.3.8, such applications may
     include requests for payment on account of changes in the Work which have
     been properly authorized by Construction Change Directives, or by interim
     determinations of the Architect, but not yet included in Change Orders.

     9.3.1.2      Such applications may not include requests for payment for
     portions of the Work for which the Contractor does not intend to pay to a
     Subcontractor or material supplier, unless such Work has been performed by
     others whom the Contractor intends to pay.

     9.3.2        Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, payments
     shall be made on account of materials and equipment delivered and suitably
     stored at the site for subsequent incorporation in the Work. If approved
     in advance by the Owner, payment may similarly be made for materials and
     equipment suitably stored off the site at a location agreed upon in
     writing. Payment for materials and equipment stored on or off the site
     shall be conditioned upon compliance by the Contractor with procedures
     satisfactory to the Owner to establish the Owner's title to such
     materials and equipment or otherwise protect the Owner's interest, and

     shall include the costs of applicable insurance, storage and transportation
     to the site for such materials and equipment stored off the site.

     9.3.2.1      Reference Attachment B - Stored Materials

     9.3.3        The Contractor warrants that title to all Work covered by an
     Application for Payment will pass to the Owner no later than the time of
     payment. The Contractor further warrants that upon submittal of an
     Application for Payment all Work for which Certificates for Payment have
     been previously issued and payments received from the Owner shall, to the
     best of the Contractor's knowledge, information and belief, be free and
     clear of liens, claims, security interests or encumbrances in favor of the
     Contractor, Subcontractors, material suppliers, or other persons or
     entities making a claim by reason of having provided labor, materials and
     equipment relating to the Work.

     9.4          CERTIFICATES FOR PAYMENT

     9.4.1        The Architect will, within seven days after receipt of the
     Contractor's Application for Payment, either issue to the Owner a
     Certificate for Payment, with a copy to the Contractor, for such amount as
     the Architect determines is properly due, or notify the Contractor and
     Owner in writing of the Architect's reasons for withholding certification
     in whole or in part as provided in Subparagraph 9.5.1.

     9.4.2        The issuance of a Certificate for Payment will constitute a
     representation by the Architect to the Owner, based on the Architect's
     evaluation of the Work and the data comprising the Application for Payment,
     that the Work has progressed to the point indicated and that, to the best
     of the Architect's knowledge, information and belief, the quality of the
     Work is in accordance with the Contract Documents. The foregoing
     representations are subject to an evaluation of the Work for conformance
     with the Contract Documents upon Substantial Completion, to results of
     subsequent tests and inspections, to correction of minor deviations from
     the Contract Documents prior to completion and to specific qualifications
     expressed by the Architect. The issuance of a Certificate for Payment will
     further constitute a representation that the Contractor is entitled to
     payment in the amount certified. However, the issuance of a Certificate for
     Payment will not be a representation that the Architect has (1) made
     exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or
     quantity of the Work, (2) reviewed construction means, methods, techniques,
     sequences or procedures, (3) reviewed copies of requisitions received from
     Subcontractors and material suppliers and other data requested by the Owner
     to substantiate the Contractor's right to payment, or (4) made examination
     to ascertain how or for what purpose the Contractor has used money
     previously paid on account of the Contract Sum.

     9.5          DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD CERTIFICATION

     9.5.1        The Architect may withhold a Certificate for Payment in whole
     or in part, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the
     Owner, if in the Architect's opinion the representations to the Owner
     required by Subparagraph 9.4.2 cannot be made. If the Architect is unable
     to certify payment in the amount of the Application, the Architect will
     notify the Contractor and Owner as provided in Subparagraph 9.4.1. If the
     Contractor and Architect cannot agree on a revised amount, the Architect
     will promptly issue a Certificate for Payment for the amount for which the
     Architect is able to make such representations to the Owner. The Architect
     may also withhold a Certificate for Payment or, because of subsequently
     discovered evidence, may nullify the whole or a part of a Certificate for
     Payment previously issued, to such extent as may be necessary in the
     Architect's or Owner's opinion to protect the Owner from loss for which the
     Contractor is responsible, including loss resulting from acts and omissions
     described in Subparagraph 3.3.2, because of:

                 .1   defective Work not remedied;

                 .2    third party claims filed or reasonable evidence
                       indicating probable filing of such claims unless security
                       acceptable to the Owner is provided by the Contractor;

                 .3    failure of the Contractor to make payments properly to
                       Subcontractors or for labor, materials or equipment;

                       the unpaid balance of the Contract Sum;

                  5.   damage to the Owner or another contractor;

                  6.   reasonable evidence that the Work will not be completed
                       within the Contract Time, and that the unpaid balance
                       would not be adequate to cover actual or liquidated
                       damages for the anticipated delay; or

                  7.   persistent failure to carry out the Work in accordance
                       with the Contract Documents.

     9.5.2        When the above reasons for withholding certification are
     removed, certification will be made for amounts previously withheld.

     9.6          PROGRESS PAYMENTS

     9.6.1        After the Architect has issued a Certificate for Payment, the
     Owner shall make payment in the manner and within the time provided in the
     Contract Documents, and shall so notify the Architect. If any condition of
     default under the Contract Documents (including, but not limited to, those
     defaults set forth in Clauses 9.5.1.1 through 9.5.1.7) remains uncured as
     of the date of any Certificate of Payment, the Owner may withhold from the
     payment on that Certificate of Payment the amount the Owner reasonably
     believes is appropriate to protect the Owner from risk that arrises from
     such default until the default condition is cured. The Owner shall not be
     deemed in default of the Contract by reason of withholding payment while
     any of such defaults remain uncured.

     9.6.2        The Contractor shall promptly pay each Subcontractor, upon
     receipt of payment from the Owner, out of the amount paid to the Contractor
     on account of such Subcontractor's portion of the Work, the amount to which
     said Subcontractor is entitled, reflecting percentages actually retained
     from payments to the Contractor on account of such Subcontractor's portion
     of the Work. The Contractor shall, by appropriate agreement with each
     Subcontractor, require each Subcontractor to make payments to
     Sub-subcontractors in a similar manner.

     9.6.3

     9.6.4        Neither the Owner nor Architect shall have an obligation to
     pay or to see to the payment of money to a Subcontractor except as may
     otherwise be required by law.

     9.6.5        Payment to material suppliers shall be treated in a manner
     similar to that provided in Subparagraphs 9.6.2, 9.6.3 and 9.6.4.

     9.6.6        A Certificate for Payment, a progress payment, or partial or
     entire use or occupancy of the Project by the Owner shall not constitute
     acceptance of Work not in accordance with the Contract Documents.

     9.6.7        Unless the Contractor provides the Owner with a payment bond
     in the full penal sum of the Contract Sum, payments received by the
     Contractor for Work properly performed by Subcontractors and suppliers
     shall be held by the Contractor for those Subcontractors or suppliers who
     performed Work or furnished materials, or both, under contract with the
     Contractor for which payment was made by the Owner. Nothing contained
     herein shall require money to be placed in a separate account and not
     commingled with money of the Contractor, shall create any fiduciary
     liability or tort liability on the part of the Contractor for breach of

     trust or shall entitle any person or entity to an award of punitive damages
     against the Contractor for breach of the requirements of this provision.

     9.7          FAILURE OF PAYMENT

     9.7.1        If the Architect does not issue a Certificate for Payment,
     through no fault of the Contractor, within seven days after receipt of the
     Contractor's Application for Payment, or if the Owner does not for reasons
     other than a default on the Contract, including, but not limited to those
     defaults set forth in Clauses 9.5.1.1 through 9.5.1.7, pay the Contractor
     within seven days after the date established in the Contract Documents the
     amount certified by the Architect or awarded by arbitration, then the
     Contractor may, upon seven additional days' written notice to the Owner,
     stop the Work until payment of the amount owing has been received. The
     Contract Time shall be extended appropriately and the Contract Sum shall be
     increased by the amount of the Contractor's reasonable costs of shut-down,
     delay and start-up, plus interest as provided for in the Contract
     Documents.

     9.8          SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

     9.8.1        The work shall be considered "substantial complete" at such
     time as:

                 .1    It may be occupied by Owner and used for its intended
                       purpose, without any material impairment or interference
                       in Owner's use thereof for its designated purposes
                       resulting from the portions of the Work which are not
                       fully completed or from Contractor's performance of such
                       work as is necessary to complete the Work;

                 .2    A Certificate of Occupancy (or its equivalent under
                       applicable laws) and all other necessary governmental
                       approvals have been issued by the appropriate
                       governmental authority for the occupancy and use of the
                       completed work for its intended purposes;

                 .3    Mechanical completion has been attained and the Work may
                       be occupied by Owner and used for its intended purpose,
                       including the start-up and commissioning of all equipment
                       and mechanical, electrical and process systems; and

                 .4    A comprehensive list of items to be completed or
                       corrected (the "Punch List") has been prepared by Owner
                       or Architect and submitted, to Contractor; provided,
                       however, that Owner's preparation of any such Punch List
                       shall not prevent it from adding additional items to the
                       Punch List or modifying existing Punch List items as
                       Owner further inspects, tests, or attempts to operate its
                       business at the Site. The "Punch List" shall be completed
                       within ten days after request for same by Contractor.

     9.8.2        When the Contractor considers that the Work, or a portion
     thereof which the Owner agrees to accept separately, is substantially
     complete, the Contractor shall prepare and submit to the Owner and
     Architect a comprehensive list of items to be completed or corrected prior
     to final payment. Failure to include an item on such list does not alter
     the responsibility of the Contractor to complete all Work IN accordance
     with the Contract Documents.

     9.8.3        Upon receipt of the Contractor's list, the Architect will make
     an inspection to determine whether the Work or designated portion thereof
     is substantially complete. If the Architect's inspection discloses any
     item, whether or not included on the Contractor's list, which is not
     sufficiently complete in accordance with the Contract Documents so that the
     Owner can occupy or utilize the Work or designated portion thereof for its
     intended use, the Contractor shall, before issuance of the Certificate of
     Substantial Completion, complete or

     correct such item upon notification by the Owner or Architect. In such
     case, the Contractor shall then submit a request for another inspection by
     the Owner or Architect to determine Substantial Completion.

     9.8.4        When the Work or designated portion thereof is substantially
     complete, the Owner or Architect will prepare a Certificate of Substantial
     Completion which shall establish the date of Substantial Completion, shall
     establish responsibilities of the Owner and Contractor for security,
     maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the Work and insurance, and shall
     fix the time within which the Contractor shall finish all items on the list
     accompanying the Certificate. Warranties required by the Contract Documents
     shall commence on the date of Substantial Completion of the Work or
     designated portion thereof unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
     Substantial Completion.

     9.8.5        The Certificate of Substantial Completion shall be submitted
     to the Owner and Contractor for their written acceptance of
     responsibilities assigned to them in such Certificate. Upon such acceptance
     and consent of surety, if any, the Owner shall make payment of retainage
     applying to such Work or designated portion thereof. Such payment shall be
     adjusted for Work that is incomplete or not in accordance with the
     requirements of the Contract Documents.

     9.9          PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OR USE

     9.9.1        The Owner may occupy or use any completed or partially
     completed portion of the Work at any stage when such portion is designated
     by separate agreement with the Contractor, provided such occupancy or use
     is consented to by the insurer as required under Clause 11.4.1.5 and
     authorized by public authorities having jurisdiction over the Work. Such
     partial occupancy or use may commence whether or not the portion is
     substantially complete, provided the Owner and Contractor have accepted in
     writing the responsibilities assigned to each of them for payments,
     retainage, if any, security, maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the
     Work and insurance, and have agreed in writing concerning the period for
     correction of the Work and commencement of warranties required by the
     Contract Documents. When the Contractor considers a portion substantially
     complete, the Contractor shall prepare and submit a list to the_ Owner or
     Architect as provided under Subparagraph 9.8.2. Consent of the Contractor
     to partial occupancy or use shall not be unreasonably withheld. The stage
     of the progress of the Work shall be determined by written agreement
     between the Owner and Contractor or, if no agreement is reached, by
     decision of the Architect.

     9.9.2        Immediately prior to such partial occupancy or use, the Owner,
     Contractor and Architect shall jointly inspect the area to be occupied or
     portion of the Work to be used in order to determine and record the
     condition of the Work.

     9.9.3        Unless otherwise agreed upon, partial occupancy or use of a
     portion or portions of the Work shall not constitute acceptance of Work not
     complying with the requirements of the Contract Documents.

     9.10         FINAL COMPLETION AND FINAL PAYMENT

     9.10.1       Contractor shall notify Owner in writing when Contractor
     considers all Work, including, but not limited to, the Punch List, to be
     complete and ready for Owner's acceptance. Owner (and, if it so elects, its
     consultants, architects, and engineers) shall conduct such final
     inspections and tests as necessary to satisfy Owner that the ' Work
     conforms to all of the requirements of the Contract Documents. If, in
     Owner's opinion, the Work, or any part thereof, fails to conform to the
     requirements of the Contract Documents. Owner shall notify Contractor in
     writing, adding any such non - conforming Work to the Punch List.
     Immediately upon notification, Contractor must

    take such corrective action necessary to bring the Work, or any part
    thereof, into conformance with the Contract Documents. Failure by Contractor
    to do so shall give Owner the right to terminate this Agreement for default
    under the provisions of this Agreement.

    9.10.2. The Work will be considered to have achieved "Final Completion" at
    such time as:

    .1 All items on the Punch List have been completed to the satisfaction of
    Owner and Contractor is in possession of Owner's written notice of
    acceptance of the Work, which written notice shall be deemed to have been
    given if Owner fails to respond to Contractor's written notification that
    all Punch List items have been completed within ten (10) days of Owner's
    receipt of such notification;"

    .2 The Work has been completed to such an extent that a proper "Notice of
    Completion" (or any similar document under applicable law, custom, and
    practice sufficient to establish an outside date for the filing of any
    mechanic's or materialmen's liens against the Site) may be filed with the
    appropriate governmental authority:

    .3 All "as-built" Drawings, warranties, guarantees, training, operations,
    maintenance and repair manuals, spare parts lists and suppliers, "as-built"
    material lists, spare materials and any other submissions required by the
    Contract Documents have been received and approved by Owner:

    .4 All quality assurance documentation with respect to commissioning and
    testing of the completed Work has been provided to and reviewed by Owner,
    and the quality assurance issues have been resolved to the satisfaction of
    Owner:

    .5 This Agreement has been fully performed by Contractor, except for
    Contractor's responsibility to correct defective or nonconforming Work of
    which Owner has not yet notified Contractor of Contractor's obligation to
    correct the same. All equipment and facilities necessary for the full, safe
    and continuously reliable operation of the completed Work have been properly
    constructed, installed, insulated and protected where required for such
    operation and correctly adjusted: and

    .6 A final progress payment request and a final accounting for the Contract
    Sum and all required supporting documentation have been submitted by
    Contractor and reviewed by Owner's accountants, and all other conditions to
    final payment set forth in the Contract Documents have been satisfied.

    9.10.3 Upon receipt of written notice that the Work is ready for final
    inspection and acceptance and upon receipt of a final Application for
    Payment, the Owner or Architect will promptly make such inspection and,
    when the Architect finds the Work acceptable under the Contract Documents
    and the Contract fully performed, the Architect will promptly issue a final
    Certificate for Payment stating that to the best of the Architect's
    knowledge, information and belief, and on the basis of the Architect's
    on-site visits and inspections, the Work has been completed in accordance
    with terms and conditions of the Contract Documents and that the entire
    balance found to be due the Contractor and noted in the final Certificate is
    due and payable. The Architect's final Certificate for Payment will
    constitute a further representation that conditions listed in Subparagraph
    9.10.2 as precedent to the Contractor's being entitled to final payment have
    been fulfilled.

    9.10.4 Neither final payment nor any remaining retained percentage shall
    become due until the Contractor submits to the Owner (1) an affidavit that
    payrolls, bills for materials and equipment, and other indebtedness
    connected with the Work for which the Owner or the Owner's property might be
    responsible or encumbered (less amounts withheld by Owner) have been paid or
    otherwise satisfied, (2) a certificate evidencing that insurance required by
    the Contract Documents to remain in force after final payment is currently
    in effect and will not be canceled or allowed to expire until at least 30
    days' prior written notice has been given to the Owner, (3) a written
    statement that the Contractor knows of no substantial reason that the
    insurance will not be renewable to cover the period required by the Contract
    Documents, (4) consent of surety, if any, to final payment and (5), if
    required by the Owner, other data establishing payment or satisfaction of
    obligations, such as receipts, releases and waivers of liens, claims,
    security interests or encumbrances arising out of the Contract, to the
    extent and in such form as may be designated by the Owner. If a
    Subcontractor refuses to furnish a release or waiver required by Owner, and
    has not recorded a claim of mechanic's lien against the Project. Contractor
    may furnish a bond satisfactory to Owner to indemnify Owner against such
    unrecorded claim of Subcontractor. If a Subcontractor has recorded a claim
    of mechanic's lien against the project and refuses to furnish a release or
    wavier required by Owner, Contractor may furnish a bond under the provisions
    of California Code 3143 to release the Project from the effect of such lien.
    In either event, once Contractor furnishes the bond no payments shall be
    withheld from Contractor as a result of the Subcontractor's claim or lien.

    9.10.5 If, after Substantial Completion of the Work, final completion
    thereof is materially delayed through no fault of the Contractor or by
    issuance of Change Orders affecting final completion, the Owner shall, upon
    application by the Contractor and without terminating the Contract, make
    payment of the balance due for that portion of the Work fully completed and
    accepted. If the remaining balance for Work not fully completed or corrected
    is less than retainage stipulated in the Contract Documents, and if bonds
    have been furnished, the written consent of surety to payment of the balance
    due for that portion of the Work fully completed and accepted shall be
    submitted by the Contractor to the Owner or Architect prior to certification
    of such payment. Such payment shall be made under terms and conditions
    governing final payment, except that it shall not constitute a waiver of
    claims.

    9.10.6

    9.10.7 Acceptance of final payment by the Contractor, a Subcontractor or
    material supplier shall constitute a waiver of claims by that payee except
    those previously made in writing and identified by that payee as unsettled
    at the time of final Application for Payment.

    10.3   HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

    10.3.1 If reasonable precautions will be inadequate to prevent foreseeable
    bodily injury or death to persons resulting from a material or substance,
    including but not limited to asbestos or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB),
    encountered on the site by the Contractor, the Contractor shall, upon
    recognizing the condition, immediately stop Work in the affected area and
    report the condition to the Owner and Architect in writing.

    10.3.2 The Owner shall obtain the services of a licensed laboratory to
    verify the presence or absence of the material or substance encountered on
    the Site and reasonably reported to Owner by the Contractor and, in the
    event such material or substance is found to be present, to verify that it
    has been rendered harmless. Unless otherwise required by the Contract
    Documents, the Owner shall furnish in writing to the Contractor and
    Architect the names and qualifications of persons or entities who are to
    perform tests verifying the presence or absence of such material or
    substance or who are to perform the task of removal or safe containment of
    such material or substance. The Contractor and the Architect will promptly
    reply to the Owner in writing stating whether or not either has reasonable
    objection to the persons or entities proposed by the Owner. If either the
    Contractor or Architect has an objection to a person or entity proposed by
    the Owner, the Owner shall propose another to whom the Contractor and the
    Architect have no reasonable objection. When the material or substance has
    been rendered harmless, Work in the affected area shall resume upon written
    agreement of the Owner and Contractor. The Contract Time shall be extended
    appropriately and the Contract Sum shall be increased in the amount of the
    Contractor's reasonable additional costs of shut-down, delay and start-up,
    which adjustments shall be accomplished as provided in Article 7.

    10.3.3 To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Owner shall indemnify and
    hold harmless the Contractor, Subcontractors, Architect, Architect's
    consultants and agents and employees of any of them from and against claims,
    damages, losses and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees,
    arising out of or resulting from performance of the Work in the affected
    area if in fact the material or substance presents the risk of bodily injury
    or death as described in Subparagraph 10.3.1 and has not been rendered
    harmless, provided that such claim, damage, loss or expense is attributable
    to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury to or destruction
    of tangible property (other than the Work itself) and provided that such
    damage, loss or expense is not due to the sole negligence of a party seeking
    indemnity.

    10.4   The Owner shall not be responsible under Paragraph 10.3 for materials
    and substances brought to the site by the Contractor unless such materials
    or substances were required by the Contract Documents.

10.5 If, without negligence on the part of the Contractor, the Contractor is
held liable for the cost of remediation of a hazardous material or substance
solely by reason of performing Work as required by the Contract Documents, the
Owner shall indemnify the Contractor for all cost and expense thereby reasonably
incurred by Contractor.

    10.6   EMERGENCIES

    10.6.1 In an emergency affecting safety of persons or properly, the
    Contractor shall act, at the Contractor's discretion, to prevent threatened
    damage, injury or loss. Additional compensation or extension of time claimed
    by the Contractor on account of an emergency shall be determined as provided
    in Paragraph 4.3 and Article 7.

    form and shall include, without limitation, insurance against the perils of
    fire (with extended coverage) and physical loss or damage including, without
    duplication of coverage, theft, vandalism, malicious mischief, collapse,

    buildings and debris removal including demolition occasioned by enforcement
    of any applicable legal requirements, and shall cover reasonable
    compensation for Architect's and Contractor's services and expenses required
    as a result of such insured loss.

    11.4.1.2 If the Owner does not intend to purchase such property insurance
    required by the Contract and with all of the coverages in the amount
    described above, the Owner shall so inform the Contractor in writing prior
    to commencement of the Work. The Contractor may then effect insurance which
    will protect the interests of the Contractor, Subcontractors and
    Sub-subcontractors in the Work, and by appropriate Change Order the cost
    thereof shall be charged to the Owner. If the Contractor is damaged by the
    failure or neglect of the Owner to purchase or maintain insurance as
    described above, without so notifying the Contractor in writing, then the
    Owner shall bear all reasonable costs properly attributable thereto.

    costs not covered because of such deductibles.

    mutual written consent, take no action with respect to partial occupancy or
    use that would cause cancellation, lapse or reduction of insurance.

    boiler and machinery insurance required by the Contract Documents or by law,
    which shall specifically cover such insured objects during installation and

    and the Owner and Contractor shall be named insureds.

    11.4.3 Loss of Use Insurance. The Owner, at the Owner's option, may purchase
    and maintain such insurance as will insure the Owner against loss of use of
    the Owner's property due to fire or other hazards, however caused. The Owner
    waives all rights of action against the Contractor for loss of use of the
    Owner's property, including consequential losses due to fire or other
    hazards however caused.

    11.4.4 If the Contractor requests in writing that insurance for risks other
    than those described herein or other special causes of loss be included in
    the property insurance policy, the Owner shall, if possible, include such
    insurance, and the cost thereof shall be charged to the Contractor by
    appropriate Change Order.

    11.4.5 If during the Project construction period the Owner insures
    properties, real or personal or both, at or adjacent to the site by property
    insurance under policies separate from those insuring the Project, or if
    after final payment property insurance is to be provided on the completed
    Project through a policy or policies other than those insuring the Project
    during the construction period, the Owner shall waive all rights in
    accordance with the terms of Subparagraph 11.4.7 for damages caused by fire
    or other causes of loss covered by this separate property insurance. All
    separate policies shall provide this waiver of subrogation by endorsement or
    otherwise.

    Contractor a copy of each policy that includes insurance coverages required
    by this Paragraph 11.4. Each policy shall contain all generally applicable
    conditions, definitions, exclusions and endorsements related to this
    Project. Each policy shall contain a provision that the policy will not be
    canceled or allowed to expire, and that its limits will not be reduced,
    until at least 30 days' prior written notice has been given to the
    Contractor.

    11.4.7 Waivers of Subrogation. The Owner and Contractor waive all rights
    against (i) each other and any of their subcontractors, sub-subcontractors,
    agents and employees, each of the other, and (2) the Architect, Architect's
    consultants, separate contractors described in Article 6, if any, and any of
    their subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, agents and employees, for damages
    caused by fire or other causes of loss to the extent covered by property
    insurance obtained pursuant to this Paragraph 11.4 or other properly
    insurance applicable to the Work, except such rights as they have to
    proceeds of such insurance held by the Owner as fiduciary. The Owner or
    Contractor, as appropriate, shall require of the Architect, Architect's
    consultants, separate contractors described in Article 6, if any, and the
    subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, agents and employees of any of them, by
    appropriate agreements, written where legally required for validity, similar
    waivers each in favor of other parties enumerated herein. The policies shall
    provide such waivers of subrogation by endorsement or otherwise. A waiver of
    subrogation shall be effective as to a person or entity even though that
    person or entity would otherwise have a duty of indemnification, contractual

    property damaged.

    the Owner as fiduciary and made payable to the Owner as fiduciary for the
    insureds, as their interests may appear, subject to requirements of any
    applicable mortgagee clause and of Subparagraph 11.4.10. The Contractor
    shall pay Subcontractors their just shares of insurance proceeds received by
    the Contractor, and by appropriate agreements, written where legally
    required for validity, shall require Subcontractors to make payments to
    their Sub-subcontractors in similar manner.

    11.4.9 If required in writing by a party in interest, the Owner as fiduciary
    shall, upon occurrence of an insured loss, give bond for proper performance
    of the Owner's duties. The cost of required bonds shall be charged against
    proceeds received as fiduciary. The Owner shall deposit in a separate
    account proceeds so received, which the Owner shall distribute in accordance
    with such agreement as the parties in interest may reach, or in accordance
    with an arbitration award in which case the procedure shall be as provided

ARTICLE 12 UNCOVERING AND CORRECTION OF WORK

    12.1 UNCOVERING OF WORK

    12.1.1 If a portion of the Work is covered contrary to the Owner or
    Architect's request or to requirements specifically expressed in the
    Contract Documents, it must, if required in writing by the Owner or
    Architect, be uncovered for the Owner or Architect's examination and be
    replaced at the Contractor's expense without change in the Contract Time.

    12.1.2 If a portion of the Work has been covered which neither the Owner nor
    Architect has not specifically requested to examine prior to its being
    covered, the Owner or Architect may request to see such Work and it shall be
    uncovered by the Contractor. If such Work is in accordance with the Contract
    Documents, costs of uncovering and replacement shall, by appropriate Change
    Order, be at the Owner's expense. If such Work is not in accordance with the
    Contract Documents, correction shall be at the Contractor's expense unless
    the condition was caused by the Owner or a separate contractor in which
    event the Owner shall be responsible for payment of such costs.

    12.2 CORRECTION OF WORK

    12.2.1 BEFORE OR AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

    12.2.1.1 The Contractor shall promptly correct Work or failing to conform to
    the requirements of the Contract Documents, whether discovered before or
    after Substantial Completion and whether or not fabricated, installed or
    completed. Costs of correcting such rejected Work, including additional
    testing and inspections and compensation for the Architect's services and
    expenses made necessary thereby, shall be at the Contractor's expense.

    12.2.2 AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

    12.2.2.1 In addition to the Contractor's obligations under Paragraph 3.5,
    if, within-one year after the dale of Substantial Completion of the Work or
    designated portion thereof or after the date for commencement of warranties
    established under Subparagraph 9.9.1, or by terms of an applicable special
    warranty required by the Contract Documents, any of the Work is found to be
    not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents (including
    the warranty set forth in Section 3.5.3, the Contractor shall correct it
    promptly after receipt of written notice from the Owner to do so unless the
    Owner has previously given the Contractor a written acceptance of such
    condition. The Owner shall give such notice promptly after discovery of the
    condition. During the one-year period for correction of Work, if the Owner
    fails to notify the Contractor and give the Contractor an opportunity to
    make the correction, the Owner waives the rights to require correction by
    the Contractor and to make a claim for breach of warranty. If the Contractor
    fails to correct nonconforming Work within a reasonable time during that
    period after receipt of notice from the Owner or Architect, the Owner may
    correct it in accordance with Paragraph 2.4.

   12.2.2.2 The one-year period for correction of Work shall be extended with
   respect to portions of Work first performed after Substantial Completion by
   the period of time between Substantial Completion and the actual performance
   of the Work.

   12.2.2.3 The one-year period for correction of Work shall not be extended by
   corrective Work performed by the Contractor pursuant to this Paragraph 12.2.

    12.2.3 The Contractor shall remove from the site portions of the Work which
    are not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents and
    are neither corrected by the Contractor nor accepted by the Owner.

    12.2.4 The Contractor shall bear the cost of correcting destroyed or damaged
    construction, whether completed or partially completed, of the Owner or
    separate contractors caused by the Contractor's correction or removal of
    Work which is not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract
    Documents.

    12.2.5 Nothing contained in this Paragraph 12.2 shall be construed to
    establish a period of limitation with respect to other obligations which the
    Contractor might have under the Contract Documents. Establishment of the
    one-year period for correction of Work as described in Subparagraph 12.2.2
    relates only to the specific obligation of the Contractor to correct the
    Work, and has no relationship to the time within which the obligation to
    comply with the Contract Documents may be sought to be enforced, nor to the
    time within which proceedings may be commenced to establish the Contractor's
    liability with respect to the Contractor's obligations other than
    specifically to correct the Work.

    12.3 ACCEPTANCE OF NONCONFORMING WORK

    12.3.1 If the Owner prefers to accept Work which is not in accordance with
    the requirements of the Contract Documents, the Owner may do so instead of
    requiring its removal and correction, in which case the Contract Sum will be
    reduced as appropriate and equitable. Such adjustment shall be effected
    whether or not final payment has been made.

ARTICLE 13 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

    13.1 GOVERNING LAW

    13.1.1 The Contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the
    Project is located.

    13.2 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

    13.2.1 The Owner and Contractor respectively bind themselves, their
    partners, successors, assigns and legal representatives to the other party
    hereto and to partners, successors, assigns and legal representatives of
    such other party in respect to covenants, agreements and obligations
    contained in the Contract Documents. Except as provided in Subparagraph
    13.2.2, neither party to the Contract shall assign the Contract as a whole
    without written consent of the other. If either party attempts to make such
    an assignment without such consent, that party shall nevertheless remain
    legally responsible for all obligations under the Contract. Owner has
    specifically contracted for the services of Contractor and, therefore,
    Contractor may not assign or delegate Contractor's obligations under this
    Agreement, either in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of
    Owner, which may be granted or withheld in the sole and absolute discretion
    of Owner. Any attempt by Contractor to assign or delegate this Agreement, in
    whole or in part, without Owner's prior written consent, shall be voidable
    at the option of Owner. Owner may assign this Agreement at any time without
    the prior consent of Contractor. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
    this Section, Contractor hereby agrees to promptly execute any and all
    documents which may be reasonably requested by any lender respecting the
    assignment of this Agreement or Owner's rights and obligations thereunder,
    in whole or in part, and Contractor shall be bound thereby.

    13.2.2 The Owner may, with consent of the Contractor collaterally, assign
    the Contract to an institutional lender providing construction financing
    for the Project. In such event, the lender shall assume the Owner's rights
    and obligations under the Contract Documents only if the lender forecloses
    on its collateral assignment or surety interests. The Contractor shall
    execute all consents reasonably required to facilitate such assignment.

    writing.

    13.5 TESTS AND INSPECTIONS

    13.5.1 Tests, inspections and approvals of portions of the Work required by

    testing, inspection or approval by an entity acceptable to the Owner, and

    Architect may be present for such procedures. Such costs, except as provided

    Subparagraphs 13.5.1 and 13.5.2 reveal failure of the portions of the Work
    to comply with requirements established by the Contract Documents, all costs
    made necessary by such failure including those of repeated procedures and
    compensation for the Architect's services and expenses shall be at the
    Contractor's expense.

    unless otherwise required by the Contract Documents, be secured by the
    Contractor and promptly delivered to the Owner or Architect.

ARTICLE 14 TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE CONTRACT

    14.1   TERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTOR

    14.1.1 The Contractor may terminate the Contract if the Work is stopped for
    a period of 30 consecutive days through no act or fault of the Contractor or
    a Subcontractor, Sub- subcontractor or their agents or employees or any
    other persons or entities performing portions of the Work under direct or
    indirect contract with the Contractor, for any of the following reasons:

        .1  issuance of an order of a court or other public authority having
            jurisdiction which requires all Work to be stopped;

        .2  an act of government, such as a declaration of national emergency
            which requires all Work to be stopped;

        .3  because the Architect has not issued a Certificate for Payment and
            has not notified the Contractor of the reason for withholding
            certification as provided in Subparagraph 9.4.1, or because the
            Owner has not made payment on a Certificate ' for Payment within the
            time stated in the Contract Documents; or

        .4  the Owner has failed to furnish to the Contractor promptly, upon the
            Contractor's request, reasonable evidence as required by
            Subparagraph 2.2.1.

    14.1.2 The Contractor may terminate the Contract if, through no act or fault
    of the Contractor or a Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or their agents or
    employees or any other persons or entities performing portions of the Work
    under direct or indirect contract with the Contractor, repeated suspensions,
    delays or interruptions of the entire Work by the Owner as described in
    Paragraph 14.3 constitute in the aggregate more than 100 percent of the
    total number of days scheduled for completion, or 120 days in any 365-day
    period, whichever is less.

    14.1.3 If one of the reasons described in Subparagraph 14.1.1 or 14.1.2
    exists, the Contractor may, upon seven days' written notice to the Owner and
    Architect, terminate the Contract and recover from the Owner payment for
    Work executed and for proven loss with respect to materials, equipment,
    tools, and construction equipment and machinery, including reasonable
    overhead, profit and damages.

    14.1.4 If the Work is stopped for a period of 60 consecutive days through no
    act or fault of the Contractor or a Subcontractor or their agents or
    employees or any other persons performing portions of the Work under
    contract with the Contractor because the Owner has persistently failed to
    fulfill the Owner's obligations under the Contract Documents with respect to
    matters important to the progress of the Work, the Contractor may, upon
    seven additional days' written notice to the Owner and the Architect,
    terminate the Contract and recover from the Owner as provided in
    Subparagraph 14.1.3.

    14.2   TERMINATION BY THE OWNER FOR CAUSE

         unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of this Section, "Stored

         above in this Section, Lender will not approve disbursements for Stored
         Materials until Borrower supplies to Lender: (a) evidence satisfactory
         to Lender that the Stored Materials are or shall be included in the
         coverage of the insurance policies required by the Loan Documents; (b)
         evidence satisfactory to Lender from the seller of fabricator of the
         Stored Materials certifying that upon payment, ownership thereof will
         vest in Borrower free of any liens or claims of third parties; and (c)
         (i) evidence satisfactory to Lender that the Stored Materials are or
         shall be satisfactory stored on the Project to protect against theft or
         damage, or (ii) if the Stored Materials are not stored or shall not be
         stored on the project, then (A) evidence satisfactory to Lender that
         the Stored Materials are or shall be stored in a bonded warehouse or
         storage yard approved by Lender, and that the warehouse yard has been
         notified that Lender has a security interest in the subject Stored
         Materials, and (B) Lender shall have or will have received from
         Borrower the original warehouse receipt. With Lender's prior written
         approval, Stored Materials for which funds have been disbursed by
         Lender hereunder may be stored in the yard or warehouse of the seller
         or fabricator, subject to satisfaction of conditions (a) and (b) in
         this Paragraph, and provided further that Lender receives satisfactory
         evidence that the Stored Materials are protected against theft and
         damage, have been suitably identified as belonging to Borrower for use
         in the Project and that such seller has been notified of the security
         interest of Lender therein."
