The resulting value, after application of the  relevant haircut, will be the Adjusted Market Value of the Collateral Fund Interest. All  determinations in respect of haircuts shall be made by the Calculation Agent.    Subject to agreement by Issuing Lender, which is not to be unreasonably withheld, and  subject to a limit of one (1) time per calendar quarter, no haircut shall apply in respect of a  cured condition if Borrower can demonstrate to Issuing Lender that the condition on the  reporting date leading to a haircut no longer exists at the time of delivery of the report.    Volatility    If the Collateral Fund has a Volatility Percentage greater than or equal to 17%, the  Adjusted Market Value (before any such adjustment) shall be multiplied by a factor equal  to (i) 17% divided by (ii) the Volatility Percentage, to give a new Adjusted Market Value.    &#8220;Volatility Percentage&#8221; means the annualized standard deviation of the Collateral Fund  calculated using the 12 most recent monthly returns.    Liquidity    Applying a Liquidation Period of one (1) day, if the Collateral Fund has Liquidity less than  or equal to 50%, the Adjusted Market Value (before any such adjustment) shall be  multiplied by a factor equal to (i) Liquidity divided by (ii) 50%, to give a new Adjusted  Market Value. Subject to agreement by Issuing Lender, which is not to be unreasonably  withheld, no haircut shall apply if Borrower can demonstrate to Issuing Lender that a  market holiday causes the measurement of Liquidity to be in error and subsequent  measurements of Liquidity unaffected by market holidays would not lead to such an error.    Applying a Liquidation Period of three (3) days, if the Collateral Fund has Liquidity less  than or equal to 80%, the Adjusted Market Value (before any such adjustment) shall be  multiplied by a factor equal to (i) Liquidity divided by (ii) 80%, to give a new Adjusted  Market Value. Subject to agreement by Issuing Lender, which is not to be unreasonably  withheld, no haircut shall apply if Borrower can demonstrate to Issuing Lender that a  market holiday causes the measurement of Liquidity to be in error and subsequent  measurements of Liquidity unaffected by market holidays would not lead to such an error.    &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; means the percentage of assets of the Collateral Fund (determined on a look- through basis to the Strategy Funds) that can be liquidated within a specified number of  days (the &#8220;Liquidation Period&#8221;), which is calculated as the estimated reduction in the  Collateral Fund&#8217;s gross market value (for this purpose, calculated as the sum of (x) the  market value of all long positions and (y) the absolute value of the sum of the market value  of all short positions, in each case, held directly or indirectly by the Collateral Fund (the  &#8220;Liquidity GMV&#8221;)) over that number of days divided by the Liquidity GMV as of the  reporting date.

The estimated  reduction in Liquidity GMV is calculated by assuming that, for each day in the Liquidation  Period, up to 15% of the average daily volume over the past 20 days of a particular position  can be traded. There is no observable market volume for FX, FX Options, and other OTC  derivatives; therefore internally estimated daily volumes provided by the Borrower (acting  in good faith) shall be used to compute the average daily volume over the prior 20 days.  Cash equivalents held at Two Sigma Hamilton Fund, LLC shall be excluded from the  liquidation calculation.    Leverage    In the event the STV GMV-to-Capital Ratio is greater than (x) at any time during the  Transition Period, 12 or (y) at any other time, 11, the Adjusted Market Value (before any  such adjustment) of the STV Strategy Allocation shall be multiplied by a factor equal to (i)  12 or 11, as applicable, divided by (ii) the STV GMV-to-Capital Ratio, in determining the  Adjusted Market Value. &#8220;STV GMV-to-Capital Ratio&#8221; means the STV GMV divided by  the STV Strategy Allocation.    In the event the ESTV GMV-to-Capital Ratio is greater than (x) at any time during the  Transition Period, 12 or (y) at any other time, 11, the Adjusted Market Value (before any  such adjustment) of the ESTV Strategy Allocation shall be multiplied by a factor equal to  (i) 12 or 11, as applicable, divided by (ii) the ESTV GMV-to-Capital Ratio, in determining  the Adjusted Market Value. &#8220;ESTV GMV-to-Capital Ratio&#8221; means the ESTV GMV  divided by the ESTV Strategy Allocation.    In the event the FTV Margin-to-Equity Ratio is greater than 50%, the Adjusted Market  Value (before any such adjustment) of the FTV Strategy Allocation shall be multiplied by a  factor equal to (i) 50% divided by (ii) the FTV Margin-to-Equity Ratio, in determining the  Adjusted Market Value. &#8220;FTV Margin-to-Equity Ratio&#8221; means (i) that portion of margin  required to be posted by FTV allocated to the FTV Strategy Allocation divided by (ii) the  FTV Strategy Allocation.    In the event the STV Strategy Allocation has a NMV-to-Capital Ratio of more than 75%,  the Adjusted Market Value (before such adjustment) of the STV Strategy Allocation shall  be multiplied by a factor equal to (i) 75% divided by (ii) the NMV-to-Capital Ratio, to give  a new Adjusted Market Value.    In the event the ESTV Strategy Allocation has a NMV-to-Capital Ratio of more than 75%,  the Adjusted Market Value (before such adjustment) of the ESTV Strategy Allocation shall  be multiplied by a factor equal to (i) 75% divided by (ii) the NMV-to-Capital Ratio, to give  a new Adjusted Market Value.    &#8220;NMV-to-Capital Ratio&#8221; means the NMV of the Collateral Fund&#8217;s allocation to STV or  ESTV, as applicable, divided by the capital allocated to the STV Strategy Allocation or the  ESTV Strategy Allocation, as applicable.  </FONT></DIV>

Unencumbered Cash    In the event the Collateral Fund has Unencumbered Cash of less than 15% of the Collateral  Fund&#8217;s net asset value, the Adjusted Market Value (before any such adjustment) shall be  multiplied by a factor equal to (i) the percentage of Unencumbered Cash held by the  Collateral Fund divided by (ii) 15%, to give a new Adjusted Market Value.    &#8220;Unencumbered Cash&#8221; means cash held by the Collateral Fund that is free and clear of any  encumbrances such as creditor claims or Liens, other than Liens in favor of the custodian  or bank that maintains the account in which such assets are held, such Liens to be only in  respect of costs, fees, intraday advances to facilitate the settlement of cash equivalent  securities and indemnities, in each case related to the maintenance of such account and the  assets held therein.
