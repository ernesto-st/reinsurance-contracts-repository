          LOAN AGREEMENT dated as of October 6, 1995 between INNKEEPERS
FINANCING PARTNERSHIP II, L.P., a limited partnership duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Virginia (the "Borrower") and NOMURA
ASSET CAPITAL CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of the State
of Delaware (together with its successors and assigns, the "Lender").

                                    RECITALS

          WHEREAS, Borrower desires to obtain a loan (the "Loan") from Lender in
the aggregate principal amount of $30,000,000 (the "Loan Amount");

          WHEREAS, Lender is unwilling to make the Loan unless Borrower joins in
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Note and the other Basic
Documents (all of the foregoing capitalized terms as hereinafter defined) which
shall establish the terms and conditions of the Loan; and

          WHEREAS, Borrower and Lender contemplate that Lender's interest in and
to the Loan may be assigned by Lender to Trustee for the benefit of
certificateholders in connection with the Securitization (all of the foregoing
capitalized terms as hereinafter defined).

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the making of the Loan by Lender
and the covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement, the parties hereby covenant, agree, represent and warrant as follows:

          SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS AND ACCOUNTING MATTER.

          Section 1.01 Certain Defined Terms. As used herein, the following
terms shall have the following meanings (all terms defined in this Section 1.01
or in other provisions of this Agreement in the singular to have the same
meanings when used in the plural and viceversa):

          "Accounts" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Cash
Collateral Agreement.

          "Accrued Interest" shall have the meaning provided in Section 2.05(c).

          "Additional Costs" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Section 5.01 hereof.

          "Additional Interest" shall have the meaning provided in Section
2.05(c).

<PAGE>

          "Administrative Agent" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
the Cash Collateral Agreement.

          "Affiliate" shall mean, as to any Person, any other Person which
directly or indirectly controls, or is under common control with, or is
controlled by, such Person and, if such Person is an individual, any member of
the immediate family (including parents, spouse and children) of such individual
and any trust whose principal beneficiary is such individual or one or more
members of such immediate family and any Person who is controlled by any such
member or trust. As used in this definition, "control" (including, with its
correlative meanings, "controlled by" and "under common control with") shall
mean possession, directly or indirectly, of power to direct or cause the
direction of management or policies (whether through ownership of securities or
partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise), provided
that, in any event, any Person which owns directly or indirectly 5% or more of
the securities having ordinary voting power for the election of directors or
other governing body of a corporation or 5% or more of the partnership or other
ownership interests of any other Person (other than as a limited partner of such
other Person) will be deemed to control such corporation or other Person.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no individual shall be deemed to be an Affiliate
of a corporation solely by reason of his or her being an officer or director of
such corporation.

          "Allocated Loan Amount" means the portion of the Loan Amount allocated
to each Collateral Property, as set forth on Schedule A hereto, as such amounts
shall be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter set forth. Upon each
adjustment in the amount of Principal Indebtedness due to a regular monthly
payment of principal pursuant to Section 2.05(c) or a prepayment or defeasance
of part of the Loan other than in connection with a release of the Liens of the
Security Documents with respect to a Collateral Property, each Allocated Loan
Amount shall be decreased by an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of
such principal payment or defeasance and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the applicable Allocated Loan Amount (prior to the adjustment in question)
and the denominator of which is the total of all Allocated Loan Amounts prior to
the adjustment to the Principal Indebtedness resulting in the recalculation of
the Allocated Loan Amount. Allocated Loan Amounts shall in no event include any
portion of the Loan which has been defeased. When the Principal Indebtedness is
reduced as a result of Lender's receipt of Net Proceeds with respect to an Event
of Loss affecting 100% of a Collateral Property, the Allocated Loan Amount for
the Collateral Property with respect to which the Net Proceeds were received
shall be reduced to zero (such Allocated Loan Amount being referred to as the
"Withdrawn Allocated Amount"), and if the Withdrawn Allocated Amount exceeds the
Net Proceeds (such excess being referred to as the "Proceeds Deficiency"), each
other Allocated Loan Amount shall be increased by an amount equal to the product
of (1) the Proceeds Deficiency and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
applicable Allocated Loan Amount (prior to the adjustment in question) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate of all of the Allocated Loan Amounts other
than the Withdrawn Allocated Amount. When the Principal Indebtedness is reduced
or defeased in connection with the release of the Liens of the Security
Documents with respect to a Collateral Property, the Allocated Loan Amount for
each

                                       2

<PAGE>

remaining Collateral Property shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
product of (1) the excess of the Release Price over the Allocated Loan Amount
for the Collateral Property which is the subject of such Transfer (the "Excess
Amount") and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the applicable Allocated
Loan Amount (prior to the adjustment in question) and the denominator of which
is the aggregate of all of the Allocated Loan Amounts of the remaining
Collateral Properties.

          "Assignments" shall mean, collectively, each Assignment of Leases and
Rents relating to a Collateral Property.

          "Basic Documents" shall mean, collectively, this Agreement, the Pledge

office of the Trustee is located.

          "Capital Expenditures" shall mean, for any period as to any Person,

during such period, computed in accordance with GAAP.

          "Capital Lease Obligations" shall mean, as to any Person, the

(including Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board) and, for purposes of this Agreement, the amount of
such obligations shall be the capitalized amount thereof, determined in
accordance with GAAP (including such Statement No.13).

          "Cash Collateral Agreement" shall mean the Cash Collateral Account,
Pledge and Security Agreement dated as of the date hereof among the Borrower,
the Lender and the Administrative Agent, as modified and supplemented and in

Indebtedness will bear interest at the Default Rate from the date such Event of
Default occurred until such Event of Default is cured. In addition, a late
payment premium of five percent of any principal or interest payment not paid on
the Payment Date therefor shall be due with any such late payment

          (e) From and after the Prepayment Date, or upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Borrower shall prepay the

the matters in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, all in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Lender and accompanied by an Officer's Certificate
stating that such statements, calculations and information are true, correct and
complete in all material respects; and (v) upon the date of the consummation of
any such Transfer (which, if the Transfer occurs prior to the Prepayment Date,
must be the Defeasance Date), Borrower shall defease (or, in the case of a
Transfer occurring from and after the Prepayment Date, prepay) a principal
portion of the Loan in an amount equal to the Release Price, which defeasance
shall be accomplished pursuant to Section 2.09.

          (b) If Borrower is required by Lender under the provisions of a

Event of Loss with respect to a Collateral Property, Borrower shall defease (or,
in the case of an Event of Loss the Net Proceeds of which become available on or
after the Prepayment Date, prepay) a portion of the Loan such that the principal
amount defeased (or prepaid) together with (x) interest thereon to the
immediately succeeding Payment Date or (y) accrued interest thereon, if such
payment is made on a Payment Date, exhausts the Net Proceeds available for such
defeasance (or prepayment), which defeasance shall be accomplished pursuant to
Section 2.09.

          (c) Upon defeasance or prepayment of the Loan in full, Borrower shall
pay to Lender, in addition to the amounts specified in Section 2.06 or this
Section 2.07, as applicable, any other amounts then due and payable to Lender

prepayment with respect to a Transfer of any Collateral Property as described in

                                       20

<PAGE>

               (v) the payment to Lender of the Defeasance Deposit on the

               satisfactory to Lender, creating a first priority lien on the
               U.S. Treasuries purchased by Lender on behalf of Borrower with
               the Defeasance Deposit in accordance with this Section 2.09 (the
               "Security Agreement");

                    (B) with respect to defeasance of the Loan in whole pursuant
               to Section 2.06(b), releases for each of the Collateral
               Properties from the Liens of the Security Documents (for
               execution by Lender) in forms appropriate for the jurisdiction in
               which each Collateral Property is located;

                    (C) with respect to defeasance of the Loan in part in

               and the other note having a principal balance equal to the
               undefeased portion of the Note (the "Undefeased Note"). The
               Defeased Note and Undefeased Note shall have identical terms as
               the Note except for the principal balance. A Defeased Note cannot
               be the subject of any further defeasance;

               effect immediately prior to such defeasance for the certificates
               issued in connection with the Securitization which are then
               outstanding. If required by the applicable Rating Agencies, the
               Borrower shall also deliver or cause to be delivered a
               non-consolidation opinion with respect to the successor borrower
               referred to in Section 2.09(d) in form and substance satisfactory
               to Lender and the applicable Rating Agencies;

                                       21

<PAGE>

                    (F) an Officer's Certificate certifying that the
               requirements set forth in this Section 2.09 have been satisfied;

                    (G) an opinion of counsel for Borrower in form satisfactory
               to Lender stating, among other things, that Lender has a
               perfected first priority security interest in the U.S. Treasuries
               purchased by Lender on behalf of Borrower; and

                    (H) such other certificates, opinions, documents or
               instruments as Lender may reasonably request, including, without
               limitation, those reasonably required in connection with a
               Securitization.

          In connection with the conditions set forth above, Borrower hereby
     appoints Lender as its agent and attorney-in-fact for the purpose of using
     the Defeasance Deposit to purchase U.S. Treasuries which provide the
     Scheduled Defeasance Payments, and Lender shall upon receipt of the
     Defeasance Deposit purchase such U.S. Treasuries on behalf of Borrower.
     Borrower, pursuant to the Security Agreement or other appropriate document,
     shall authorize and direct that the payments received from the U.S.
     Treasuries shall be made directly to the Administrative Agent and applied
     to satisfy the obligations of Borrower (or the successor borrower referred
     to in Section 2.09(d)) under the Note or the Defeased Note, as applicable
     and the other Basic Documents.

          (b) With respect to defeasance of the Loan in whole pursuant to
     Section 2.06(b), upon compliance with the requirements of this Section
     2.09, (i) the Collateral Properties shall be released from the Liens of the
     Security Documents and (ii) the pledged U.S. Treasuries shall be the sole
     source of Collateral securing the Note. With respect to a defeasance of the
     Loan in part pursuant to Section 2.07, upon compliance with the
     requirements of this Section 2.09 the applicable Collateral Property or
     Properties shall be released pursuant to Section 2.08(a).

          (c) Any portion of the Defeasance Deposit in excess of the amount
     necessary to purchase the U.S. Treasuries required by this Section 2.09 or
     to satisfy the other requirements of this Section 2.09 shall be remitted to
     Borrower.

          (d) Borrower shall have the right to assign to Lender (or, at Lender's
     option, to Lender's designee or nominee), and Lender (or such designee or
     nominee) shall have the obligation to assume, the obligations under the
     Basic Documents relating to the principal amount so defeased. The
     obligation of Lender to establish or designate a successor borrower shall
     be retained by Nomura Asset Capital Corporation notwithstanding the sale or
     transfer of this Agreement and the Note unless such obligation is
     specifically assumed by the transferee. Such successor borrower shall
     assume the obligations under the Note or the Defeased Note, as applicable,
     and the Security Documents and Borrower shall be

                                       22

<PAGE>

     relieved of its obligations under such documents with respect thereto. The
     Borrower shall pay $1,000 to any such successor borrower as consideration
     for assuming the obligations under the Note or the Defeased Note, as
     applicable, and the Security Documents. Notwithstanding anything in this
     Agreement to the contrary, no other assumption fee shall be payable upon a
     transfer of the Note in accordance with this Section 2.09(d), but Borrower
     shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by Lender, including Lender's
     attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred in connection therewith.

          Section 2.10 Appraisals. Prior to the occurrence of a Default, the
Lender shall be entitled to request an appraisal to be performed by an appraiser
satisfactory to the Lender and/or a market study to be performed by an MAI
satisfactory to the Lender with respect to any Collateral Property or all the
Collateral Properties if, in the reasonable opinion of the Lender, an event
shall have occurred which has caused a Material Adverse Effect. After the
occurrence of a Default, the Lender shall be entitled at any time to request an
appraisal to be performed by an appraiser satisfactory to the Lender and/or a
market study to be performed by an MAI satisfactory to the Lender with respect
to any Collateral Property or all the Collateral Properties. The Borrower shall
pay all reasonable fees for any appraisals and market studies performed pursuant
to this Section 2.10.

          SECTION 3. [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]

          SECTION 4. PAYMENTS; COMPUTATIONS; ETC.

          Section 4.01 Payments. (a) Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein, all payments of principal, interest and other amounts to be made by the
Borrower under this Agreement and the Note shall be made in Dollars, in
immediately available funds, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender at the account of the Lender
maintained with the Administrative Agent, not later than 2:00 p.m. New York time
on the date on which such payment shall become due (each such payment made after
such time on such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding
Business Day).

          (b) All proceeds (including any Net Proceeds) of any repayment,
including prepayments, of the Loan shall be applied to pay: first, any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Lender; second, any interest
accruing at the Interest Rate then payable with respect to the Loan or the
portion thereof being repaid; third, the outstanding principal amount of the
Loan or the portion thereof being repaid; fourth, any interest accruing at a
rate in excess of the Interest Rate with respect to the Loan (including at the
Default Rate); fifth the Accrued Interest; and sixth, any other amounts due and
owing under the Basic Documents.

                                       23

<PAGE>

          (c) If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or the Note
would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day.

          (d) All payments made by Borrower under this Agreement shall be made
free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of,
any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied,
collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority (other than taxes
imposed on the income of Lender).

          Section 4.02 Setoff. The Borrower agrees that, in addition to (and
without limitation of) any right of set-off or counterclaim the Lender may
otherwise have, the Lender shall be entitled, at its option, to offset balances
held by it or any of its Affiliates for account of the Borrower or any Pledgor
(or amounts due from it to the Borrower or any Pledgor) at any of its offices,
in Dollars or in any other currency, against any principal of or interest on the
Loan, or any other amount payable to the Lender hereunder, which is not paid
when due (regardless of whether such balances are then due to the Borrower), in
which case it shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof, provided that the
Lender's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof.

          Section 5. YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY.

          Section 5.01 Additional Costs.

          (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Lender from time to time such
amounts as the Lender may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate it
for any increase in costs which the Lender reasonably determines are
attributable to its making or maintaining the Loan or any reduction in any
amount receivable by the Lender hereunder in respect of the Loan or such
obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being
herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

               (i) imposes or modifies any reserve or similar requirement
     relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of the Lender; or

               (ii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or the
     Note (or any of such extensions of credit).

          (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.01 (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay directly to the
Lender from time to time on request such amounts as the Lender may reasonably
determine to be necessary to compensate the Lender for any costs which it
determines are attributable to the maintenance by the Lender, pursuant to any
law or regulation or any interpretation, directive or request (whether or not

                                       24

<PAGE>

having the force of law) of any court or governmental or monetary authority, or
pursuant to any risk-based capital guideline or other requirement (whether or
not having force of law and whether or not the failure to comply therewith would
be unlawful) heretofore or hereafter issued by any government or governmental or
supervisory authority, of capital in respect to the Loan (such compensation to
be in an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of return on assets or equity
of the Lender to a level below that which the Lender could have achieved but for
such law, regulation, interpretation, directive or request).

          (c) The Lender will notify the Borrower of any event occurring after
the date of this Agreement that will entitle the Lender to compensation under
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5.01 as promptly as practicable, but in any
event within 45 days, after the Lender obtains actual knowledge thereof;
provided, however, that if the Lender fails to give such notice within 45 days
after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event, the Lender shall, with
respect to compensation payable pursuant to this Section 5.01 in respect of any
costs resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section
5.01 for costs incurred from and after the date 45 days prior to the date that
the Lender does give such notice. The Lender will furnish to the Borrower a
certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by the Lender for
compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5.01. Determinations and
allocations by the Lender for purposes of this Section 5.01 of the effect of any
Regulatory Change pursuant to Section 5.01 (a) hereof, on its costs or rate of
return of maintaining the Loan, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of the
Loan, and of the amounts required to compensate the Lender under this Section
5.01, shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations and allocations are
made on a reasonable basis.

          Section 5.02 Securitization. Borrower hereby acknowledges that Lender,
any of its Affiliates, its successors or assigns, may securitize the Loan
through the issuance of the Certificates, which will be rated by the Rating
Agencies. Borrower agrees that it will cooperate fully with Lender and the
Rating Agencies in connection with the Securitization, including, but not
limited to, by (a) entering into nonmaterial amendments to the Basic Documents
to the extent required by the Rating Agencies or otherwise in connection with
the Securitization; (b) assisting in the preparation of offering documents
describing the Loan and the Securitization in a manner that satisfies the
requirements of applicable federal and state securities laws, by (without
limitation) (i) providing such information as may be requested in connection
therewith and (ii) acting reasonably and promptly in connection with its review
and approval of the relevant portions of the offering documents; (c) causing to
be rendered such customary opinion letters (including, without limitation, with
respect to substantive nonconsolidation) as shall be requested by the Rating
Agencies, and an opinion letter from each real estate counsel to Borrower
stating that the assignment of the Loan and the Basic Documents to Trustee is
enforceable; (d) representing that as of the Securitization Closing Date (i) the
Tax Fair Market Value of each Collateral Property is equal to or greater than
the Allocated Loan Amount for such Collateral Property and (ii) the aggregate
Tax Fair Market Value of the Collateral Properties is equal to or exceeds the
Principal Indebtedness, and providing Lender with any supporting materials

                                       25

<PAGE>

reasonably requested by Lender; (e) re-making the representations and warranties
contained in the Basic Documents as of the Securitization Closing Date; and (f)
obtaining a comfort letter from a nationally recognized accounting firm in
connection with financial information relating to Borrower or the Collateral
Properties which is presented in the offering documents. Borrower agrees that
Lender shall have the right in its sole discretion in connection with the
Securitization to replace the Administrative Agent with the Servicer (or any
entity which acts as a sub-servicer) under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Borrower agrees to pay its pro rata share of third party fees and expenses in
connection with the Securitization, including, but not limited to, legal fees
and disbursements, accounting fees, third-party due diligence expenses, Rating
Agency fees and expenses, the costs of providing appraisals, environmental
reports and engineering reports as required by the Rating Agencies, Lender's
out-of-pocket costs and any servicing, Trustee or special servicing fees and
expenses. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay to Lender the sum of $100,000,
which shall be held by Lender and applied to the first $100,000 of Borrower's
pro rata share of the costs described above; and if the aggregate amount of the
costs are less than $100,000, then any excess shall be returned to Borrower. In
connection with the Securitization, Lender intends to use the engineering and
environmental reports provided for in Section 6.01, updated as necessary due to
the age of such reports, to the extent permitted by the Rating Agencies. Lender
shall provide Borrower with an itemized bill of the expenses for which it seeks
reimbursement from Borrower. On or prior to the Securitization Closing Date,
Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender an instrument (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender and Borrower) indemnifying and
holding Lender and its controlling Persons and Affiliates harmless against all
costs, expenses and damages incurred by Lender and its controlling Persons and
Affiliates (including, without limitation, all liabilities under all applicable
federal and state securities laws) as a direct result of any untrue statement of
a material fact contained in such offering documents based on information
provided by, or on behalf of, Borrower which describes Borrower, the General
Partner, the Lessee, the REIT, the Collateral Properties (and the management
thereof) or any aspect of this Loan, or as a result of any untrue statement of
material fact in any of the financial statements of Borrower, the General
Partner, the Lessee or the REIT incorporated into the offering documents or the
failure to include in such financial statements or in such offering documents
any material fact relating to Borrower, the General Partner, the Lessee, the
REIT, the Collateral Properties (and the management thereof) and any aspect of
the Loan necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however,
that Borrower shall have had an opportunity to review and shall have approved
the relevant portions of the offering documents. Borrower shall not indemnify
Lender for any liability, loss, cost or expense incurred as a result of the
inclusion of any erroneous or misleading information in the offering documents,
or the omission of material information from the offering documents, pertaining
to Borrower, the General Partner, the Lessee, the REIT, the Collateral
Properties (and the management thereof) or any aspect of this Loan, if Borrower
or its counsel shall have previously indicated in writing to Lender or its
counsel the erroneous or misleading nature of such information or the omission
of material information, as the case may be. Borrower shall not indemnify Lender
for any liability, loss, cost or expense incurred as a result of the inclusion
of

                                       26

<PAGE>

any erroneous or misleading information in the offering documents, or the
omission of material information from the offering documents, unrelated to
Borrower, the General Partner, the REIT, the Lessee, the Collateral Properties
(and the management thereof) or any aspect of the Loan.

partners and Affiliates, (H) except as expressly permitted by this Agreement,
has conducted all transactions and dealings between it and its Affiliates on an
arm's length basis and otherwise as set forth in Section 8.11 hereof. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Borrower has maintained in place, and has caused
each of its Subsidiaries to maintain in place, all policies and procedures and
has taken and will continue to take all actions to ensure that (1) creditors
deal with the Borrower as separate economic units (and not as a single economic
unit with any of its partners or any other Affiliate of the Borrower) and (2)

each other Affiliate of the Borrower (and not entangled with the affairs of any
of its partners or any other Affiliate of the Borrower). The corporate charter

General Partner (including the affirmative vote of the Independent Director) is
necessary (i) for any dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation, or to

Liens created by the Security Documents. The Borrower is able to pay its debts
as they become due, including contingent obligations reasonably likely to become
due.

          Section 7.20 Delinquent Property Liens. Except for claims which are
not material in amount or which are expressly permitted to exist under this
Agreement or which otherwise constitute Permitted Liens, there is no delinquent
tax, sewer rent, water charge, assessment or other outstanding charge against
any of the Collateral Properties; and, except as shown in the title policies,
there are no mechanics' or similar Liens or, to the Borrower's knowledge, claims

Lender, or (y) the admission or replacement of any limited partner without the
prior written consent of the Lender (except for any transfers of limited
partnership interests between and among family members of a limited partner
and/or trusts for the benefit of such family member, as to which no consent will

limited partner is of a character or reputation not approved by the Lender or is
otherwise incompatible with the Lender; provided that, after the Securitization
Closing Date, transfer of limited partnership interests shall be permitted
without consent; provided, further, that transfers aggregating more than 49% of

limited partnership. The Borrower shall not permit any partner in the Borrower

          (f) Liens arising or permitted to exist under the Basic Documents and
     Liens set forth in any title policies covering the Collateral Properties;
     and

          (g) any extension, renewal or replacement of the foregoing, provided,

activity other than the business permitted under Section 7.16 hereof. The
Borrower shall not purchase any real properties other than the Collateral

the public, act under its own partnership name and as a separate and distinct
entity, and will not identify itself as being a division or a part of the REIT

with the offices of its partners and Affiliates, and (viii) except as expressly
permitted under this Agreement, will conduct all transactions and dealings
between it and its Affiliates on an arm's length basis and otherwise as set
forth in Section 8.11 hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, the Borrower will
maintain in place all policies and procedures and take and continue to take all
actions to ensure that (A) creditors deal with the Borrower as a separate
economic unit (and not as a single economic unit with any of its partners or any
other Affiliate of the Borrower) and (B) the affairs of the Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries are kept separate from those of its partners and each other
Affiliate of the Borrower (and not entangled with the affairs of any of its

any Affiliate who is an individual may serve as a director, officer or employee
of the Borrower and receive reasonable compensation for his or her services in
such capacity and (z) the Borrower may enter into transactions (other than
extensions of credit by the Borrower to an Affiliate) providing for the leasing
of property, the rendering or receipt of services or the purchase or sale of
inventory and other assets in the ordinary course of business if the monetary or
business consideration arising therefrom would be substantially as advantageous
to the Borrower as the monetary or business consideration which would obtain in
a comparable transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

          Section 8.12 Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will use the proceeds of
the Loan solely to purchase the Collateral Properties and associated costs
permitted hereunder; provided that the Lender shall not have any responsibility

          Section 8.15 [Intentionally Deleted]

          Section 8.16 Operation of the Collateral Properties. The Borrower
shall cause each of the Collateral Properties to be leased to the Lessee
pursuant to the Operating Lease approved as to form and substance by and in all
respects acceptable to the Lender for the operation of a hotel offering services
approved by the Lender in its sole discretion at the time of acquisition of such
Collateral Property; provided, however, that the Lessee shall be permitted to
contract with TMH Hotels, Inc. for the management of the Collateral Properties
located in Windsor, Connecticut, Richmond, Virginia, San Jose, California,
Mountain View, California and Fremont, California pursuant to management
agreements approved as to form and substance by and in all respects acceptable
to the Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (A) there shall
have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default or (B) the Debt Service
Ratio of the Borrower shall at any time become less than 1.30 to 1.00 or (C) an
Event of Default shall have occurred under the Operating Lease, the Lender may
instruct the Borrower to (i) terminate the Operating Lease with respect to any
or all of the Collateral Properties and/or (ii) cause the Lessee to terminate
the management agreement with respect to any or all of the Collateral
Properties, and may designate either a replacement lessee or a property manager,
as the case may be, acceptable to the Lender and willing to operate the
Collateral Properties pursuant to terms and conditions and pursuant to an
Operating Lease or property management agreement approved by Lender, and the
Borrower shall so terminate the Operating Lease(s) and/or cause the Lessee to
terminate the management agreement(s) and appoint or cause the appointment of
such replacement lessee or property manager. The Borrower shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Lender, enter into any Operating Lease or property
management agreement in respect of any Collateral Property without the Lender's
prior written consent and unless any such agreement contains a provision
permitting such agreement to be terminated as contemplated above and unless such
replacement operator executes an agreement substantially similar (and otherwise
in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender) to the Lessee Subordination
Agreement.

          Section 8.17 Environmental Matters.

          (a) The Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, comply in all
material respects with and shall cause the Lessee of each Collateral Property to
comply in all material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to the
Collateral Properties and shall ensure that all operations, businesses and
activities conducted thereon are in material compliance with all Environmental
Laws.

                                       50

<PAGE>

          (b) The Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, comply in all
material respects with and shall cause the Lessee of each Collateral Property to
comply in all material respects with all Environmental Laws relating to asbestos
or asbestos-containing materials.

          (c) If the Borrower shall receive any notice or other communication
relating to any Collateral Property from any governmental authority concerning
any actual, alleged, suspected or threatened violation of or liability under any
Environmental Laws or any Environmental Condition, or that any representation or
warranty herein relating to Hazardous Materials is not or is no longer accurate
in any material respect, including any notice or other communication from any
governmental authority concerning any actual or threatened Environmental Claim,
then the Borrower shall deliver to the Lender, within ten (10) days after
receipt of such notice or communication, a written description of such
violation, liability, or actual or threatened event or condition. Receipt of
such notice shall not be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the
Lender to defend or otherwise respond to such notification. The Borrower shall
promptly take all actions necessary to defend such notification of Environmental
Claim or clean up or remedy such Environmental Condition in compliance with all
Environmental Laws.

          (d) Upon the Lender's reasonable request, the Borrower shall, at its
sole cost and expense, take all actions or cause the Lessee to take all actions
necessary to ensure that there is no Hazardous Material at, on or under the
Collateral Properties in quantities or concentrations other than those permitted
by applicable Environmental Laws. The Borrower shall reasonably promptly provide
to the Lender copies of all environmental site assessments or environmental
audit reports, or updates of such assessments or reports that are generated in
connection with the above activities. The Borrower's obligations hereunder shall
arise upon the reasonable request of the Lender, taking into account all of the
circumstances, including the conducting of tests in the past and with due regard
to the likelihood of finding Hazardous Materials on the Collateral Properties
regardless of whether any governmental authority has taken or threatened any
action with respect to the presence of any Hazardous Materials at, on or under
the applicable Collateral Property. If the Borrower fails to discharge any of
its obligations hereunder, the Lender shall have the right, but not the
obligation, in its reasonable discretion, at the Borrower's sole cost and
expense, to take such reasonable actions that the Lender reasonably deems
necessary or advisable, including the removal or cleanup of any Hazardous
Materials at, on or under the Collateral Properties. The Borrower grants the
Lender and its employees, contractors and agents an irrevocable and
non-exclusive license, upon reasonable prior notice, to enter upon the
Collateral Properties to conduct such activities in accordance with the
preceding sentence. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lender
under this subsection shall be due and payable by the Borrower on demand.

          (e) Following and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Borrower shall permit Lender to enter upon the Collateral Properties at any
reasonable time to conduct, at Borrower's sole cost and expense, an inspection
of such Collateral Properties, to determine

                                       51

<PAGE>

compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and to take any and all other
actions that the Lender deems reasonably necessary or advisable, including the
removal or cleanup of any Hazardous Materials in quantities or concentrations
which violate applicable Environmental Laws at, on or under the applicable
Collateral Property. Following and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Borrower grants the Lender and its employees, contractors and
agents an irrevocable and nonexclusive license to enter upon the Collateral
Properties and to perform such tests on the Collateral Properties necessary to
conduct such reviews and investigations in accordance with the preceding
sentence. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lender under this
subsection shall be due and payable by the Borrower on demand.

          (f) The Borrower shall not cause, nor permit or suffer the existence
or the commission by the Borrower, its agents, employees, contractors, invitees,
the Lessee or any other Person, of any material violation of any applicable
Environmental Laws at, on or under any of the Collateral Properties.

          SECTION 9. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. If one or more of the following events
(herein called "Events of Default") shall occur and be continuing:

     principal of or interest on the Loan (including upon the maturity of the
     Loan); or (2) the Borrower shall default in the payment when due of any
     other amount payable by it hereunder or under the other Basic Documents and

     hereof; or (2) the Borrower shall default in the performance of any of its
     obligations under any Mortgage (other than its obligation to pay any
     amounts payable under any Mortgage as to which Section 9(a)(2) shall be

examination of the financial condition of the Lender by such governmental
agency) or (y) pursuant to legal process; and provided finally that in no event
shall the Lender be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by
the Borrower. The Borrower agrees (on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates, officers, agents, employees and representatives) that it will not,
and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, issue any press release or make
