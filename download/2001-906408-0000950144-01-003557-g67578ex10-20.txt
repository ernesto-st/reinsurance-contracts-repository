         of them; (iii) a Person controlling or under common control with any

                  (xvii)   It shall not cause or permit the board of directors

be  discharged  and satisfied or assigned (to Borrower or to any other Person at
Borrower's direction and without  representation or warranty by, or recourse to,
Lender),  at Borrower's  option,  without  warranty (except that Lender shall be
deemed to have represented that such release and termination or reassignment has
been duly  authorized  and that it has not assigned or  encumbered  the Security

statements)  prepared by Borrower and as may reasonably be requested by Borrower
to evidence and to assure the effectiveness of such release and satisfaction, or
assignment,  and any such  instrument,  when duly  executed  by Lender  and,  if
appropriate,  duly  recorded  by  Borrower  in the  places  where  the  Security
Instrument and each other Loan Document is recorded, shall conclusively evidence
the release and  satisfaction  or assignment of the Security  Instrument and the
other Loan Documents.

such substitution shall be subject, in each case, to the satisfaction of the
following conditions precedent:

         free and clear of any lien or other encumbrance except for Permitted
         Encumbrances, Leases and easements, restrictive covenants and other
         title exceptions which do not have a material adverse effect on the
         utility or value of such property for its current use.

                  (ii)     Lender and Rating Agencies shall have received (A) a

         an arms' length transaction or (y) to the REIT or the Operating
         Partnership and (B) a letter from Borrower countersigned by a title
         insurance company acknowledging receipt of such deed and agreeing to
         record such deed in the real estate records for the county in which
         the Substituted Property is located. In the event the Substituted
         Property is to be conveyed to the REIT or the Operating Partnership,
         Lender shall also have received (a) a copy of a fully executed
         contract of sale between the REIT or the Operating Partnership, as
         applicable, and an entity other than Borrower or a Borrower Party for
         the sale of the Substituted Property in an arms' length transaction,
         which contract of sale (i) at the time of substitution, is not subject

                  (iii)    Lender and the applicable Rating Agencies shall have
         received an MAI appraisal of the Substitute Property dated no more
         than forty-five (45) days prior to the substitution by an appraiser
         acceptable to such Rating Agencies, indicating an appraised value of
         the Substitute Property that is at least equal to the greater of the
         appraised value of the Substituted Property determined by Lender as of
         the date hereof or determined by an Independent Appraiser as of the
         date immediately preceding the encumbrance of the Substitute Property
         by the related Security Instrument.

                  (iv)     The Debt Service Coverage Ratio Premises for the
         Substitute Property shall be a minimum of 2.3x, as determined by
         Lender in its sole and absolute discretion.

         Substitute Property has been substantially renovated




                                     -25-
<PAGE>   31

         within such three (3) year period, the Net Operating Income Premises

         than twelve (12) months.

                  (vi)     The Net Operating Income Leases for the Substitute
         Property either (A) does not show a successive decrease over the three
         (3) years immediately prior to the date of substitution, or (B) if the
         Substitute Property has been substantially renovated within such three
         (3) year period, the Net Operating Income Leases shall not show a
         successive decrease for such lesser period of no less than twelve (12)
         months

                  (vii)    The Net Operating Income Premises for the twelve
         (12) month period immediately preceding the substitution for the
         Substitute Property is at least one hundred five percent (105%) the
         Net Operating Income Premises for the twelve (12) month period
         immediately preceding the substitution for the Substituted Property.

                  (viii)   The Net Operating Income Leases for the twelve (12)
         month period immediately preceding the substitution for the Substitute
         Property is at least one hundred five percent (105%) the Net Operating
         Income Leases for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding
         the substitution for the Substituted Property.

                  (ix)     The Debt Service Coverage Ratio Premises after any
         proposed substitution, based on the remaining collateral properties,
         including the Substitute Property shall be at least equal to the
         greater of (i) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio Premises on the date
         hereof; or (ii) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio Premises immediately

         hereof; or (ii) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio Leases immediately
         prior to such substitution.

                  (xi)     The Person transferring the Substitute Property is
         solvent and the Substitute Property was transferred to Borrower in an
         arm's length transaction.

                  (xii)    If the Loan is part of a Securitization, Lender
         shall have received evidence in writing from the Rating Agencies to
         the effect that such substitution will not result in a withdrawal,
         qualification or downgrade of the respective ratings in effect
         immediately prior to such substitution for the Securities issued in
         connection with the Securitization that are then outstanding.

                  (xiii)   No Event of Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing. Lender and the Rating Agencies shall have received a
         certificate from Borrower confirming the foregoing.

         letter from Borrower countersigned by a title




                                     -26-
<PAGE>   32

         insurance company acknowledging receipt of such Security Instrument
         and UCC-1 Financing Statements and agreeing to record or file, as
         applicable, such Security Instrument and one of the UCC-1 Financing
         Statements in the real estate records for the county in which the
         Substitute Property is located and to file one of the UCC-1 Financing
         Statement in the office of the Secretary of State of the state in
         which the Substitute Property is located, so as to effectively create
         upon such recording and filing valid and enforceable liens upon the
         Substitute Property, of the requisite priority, in favor of Lender (or
         such other trustee as may be desired under local law), subject only to
         the Permitted Encumbrances and such other liens as are permitted
         pursuant to the Loan Documents, (B) an Hazardous Materials Indemnity
         Agreement with respect to the Substitute Property, (C) a
         Nondisturbance Agreement for the Substitute Property and (D) written
         confirmation from each Indemnitor and all Borrower Principals
         regarding such substitution. The Security Instrument, UCC-1 Financing
         Statements and Hazardous Materials Indemnity Agreement shall be the
         same in form and substance as the counterparts of such documents
         executed and delivered with respect to the related Substituted
         Property subject to modifications reflecting the Substitute Property
         as the Individual Property that is the subject of such documents and
         such modifications reflecting the laws of the state in which the
         Substitute Property is located as shall be recommended by the counsel
         admitted to practice in such state and delivering the opinion as to
         the enforceability of such documents required pursuant to clause (xiv)
         below. The Security Instrument encumbering the Substitute Property
         shall secure all amounts evidenced by the Note, provided that in the
         event that the jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is
         located imposes a mortgage recording, intangibles or similar tax and
         does not permit the allocation of indebtedness for the purpose of
         determining the amount of such tax payable, the principal amount
         secured by such Security Instrument shall be equal to one hundred
         twenty-five percent (125%) of the amount of the Loan allocated to the
         Substitute Property. The amount of the Loan allocated to the
         Substitute Property (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the
         "Substitute Release Amount") shall equal the Adjusted Release Amount
         of the related Substituted Property.

                  (xv)     Lender shall have received (A) any "tie-in" or
         similar endorsement to each Title Insurance Policy insuring the lien
         of an existing Security Instrument as of the date of the substitution
         available with respect to the Title Insurance Policy insuring the lien
         of the Security Instrument with respect to the Substitute Property and
         (B) a Title Insurance Policy (or a marked, signed and redated
         commitment to issue such Title Insurance Policy) insuring the lien of
         the Security Instrument encumbering the Substitute Property, issued by
         the title company that issued the Title Insurance Policies insuring
         the lien of the existing Security Instrument and dated as of the date
         of the substitution, with reinsurance and direct access agreements
         that replace such agreements issued in connection with the Title
         Insurance Policy insuring the lien of the Security Instrument
         encumbering the Substituted Property, to the extent such agreements
         are available in the jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is
         located. The Title Insurance Policy issued with respect to the
         Substitute Property shall (1) provide coverage in the amount of the
         Allocated Loan Amount if the "tie-in" or similar endorsement described
         above is available or, if such endorsement is not available, in an
         amount equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the
         Allocated Loan Amount, (2) insure Lender that the relevant




                                     -27-
<PAGE>   33

         Security Instrument creates a valid first lien on the Substitute
         Property encumbered thereby, free and clear of all exceptions from
         coverage other than Permitted Encumbrances and standard exceptions and
         exclusions from coverage (as modified by the terms of any
         endorsements), (3) contain such endorsements and affirmative coverages
         as are contained in the Title Insurance Policies insuring the liens of
         the existing Security Instrument, to the extent available in the
         jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is located and (4) name
         Lender as the insured. Lender also shall have received copies of paid
         receipts showing that all premiums in respect of such endorsements and
         Title Insurance Policies have been paid.

                  (xvi)    Lender shall have received a current title survey
         for each Substitute Property, certified to the title company and
         Lender and their successors and assigns, in the same form and having
         the same content as the certification of the Survey of the Substituted
         Property prepared by a professional land surveyor licensed in the
         state in which the Substitute Property is located and acceptable to

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  To induce the Lender to enter into this Agreement and to make
the Loan, the Borrower hereby represents and warrants and, where specifically
indicated, each Borrower Principal hereby represents and warrants (but only for
purposes of each Borrower Principal's obligations under the recourse provisions
of Section 8 of the Note), to the Lender (for itself, but not otherwise) on the
Closing Date as follows:

                  Section 4.1       Existence; Compliance with Law.

                  The Borrower and each Borrower Principal (when not an
individual) (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and
authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the
property it operates as lessor and to conduct the business in which it is
currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified to do business in and is in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where an Individual Property is
located and where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law.

                  Section 4.2       Equity Interests.

                  The owners (beneficial and otherwise) of all of the Equity
Interests in the Borrower are as set forth in Exhibit A and have been duly
authorized, are validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable.
There are no outstanding options or other rights pertaining to the Equity
Interests in the Borrower, and no voting trust or similar agreement affecting
either ownership of or the right to vote such Equity Interests (except for
those items detailed in the Borrower's operating agreement or certificate of
incorporation).

                  Section 4.3       Power; Authorization; Enforceable
Obligations.

                  The Borrower and each Borrower Principal (when not an
individual) has all requisite legal power and authority, and the legal right,
to make, deliver and perform each Loan Document to which it is, or is to be, a
party and to borrow hereunder, and has taken all necessary corporate,
partnership or company action (as the case may be) to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of each Loan Document to which it is, or is to be, a
party and to




                                     -36-
<PAGE>   42

authorize the borrowings on the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Note. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or
in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in
connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution, delivery,
performance, validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, except to the
extent specified in any such Loan Document. Each Loan Document has been (or
will be) duly executed by, and delivered on behalf of the Borrower and the
Borrower Principals, as the case may be. Each Loan Document constitutes (or
when executed and delivered will constitute) the legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against the Borrower and the Borrower Principals, as
the case may be, in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
sequestration, liquidation, consolidation or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles
(whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

                  Section 4.4       No Legal Bar.

                  The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents
will not violate any Requirement of Law applicable to the Borrower and the
Borrower Principals or any contractual obligation, security, agreement,
instrument, license or other undertaking by which the Borrower or the Borrower
Principal is bound and will not result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien (other than under the Loan Documents) on any of their
properties or revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or contractual
obligation, security, agreement, instrument, license or other undertaking.

                  Section 4.5       No Litigation.

                  No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower and the Borrower Principals, threatened against any of them or any of
their properties or revenues, or with respect to any Loan Document or any of
the transactions contemplated thereby, which would have a material adverse
effect on Borrower or Borrower Principal, and the Borrower is not a surety on
any bond through which a Lien might be created superior to the Security
Instrument.

                  Section 4.6       No Default.

                  The Borrower is not in default under, or with respect to, any
contractual obligation, security, agreement, instrument, license or other
undertaking by which the Borrower is bound which is in excess of $100,000.00.
The Borrower Principal is not in default under, or with respect to, any
contractual obligation, security, agreement, instrument, license or undertaking
by which the Borrower Principal is bound which would materially affect the
Borrower Principal's obligations under the Note. No Default Condition or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  Section 4.7       Solvency; Fraudulent Conveyance.

                  The Borrower and each Borrower Principal is solvent and will
not be rendered insolvent by the transactions contemplated hereby and, after
giving effect to such transactions,




                                     -37-

will not be left with an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to
engage in its business. Neither the Borrower nor the Borrower Principal intends
to incur, or believes that it has incurred, debts beyond its ability to pay
such debts as they mature. Neither the Borrower nor the Borrower Principal has
commenced or filed nor contemplates the commencement or filing of any
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, sequestration, liquidation,
consolidation or similar proceedings or the appointment of a receiver,
liquidator, assignee, conservator, trustee, sequestrator or similar official in
respect of it or any of its assets. The amount of the Loan constitutes
reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration for the transfer to the
Lender of the interest in the Premises represented by the Security Instrument.
Neither the Borrower nor the Borrower Principal is transferring any interest in
the Premises with any intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of its creditors.

                  Section 4.8       Special Purpose Entity.

                  The Borrower is a Special Purpose Entity.

                  Section 4.9       Taxes.

                  The Borrower and each Borrower Principal, respectively, has
filed or caused to be filed all tax returns which are required to be filed and
has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns and on any
assessments made against it and any of its property and, to its knowledge, all
other taxes, fees and other charges imposed on it and any of its property by
any Governmental Authority (other than any the amount or validity of which are
currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which reserves in conformity with Required Accounting Standards have
been provided on its books). No tax Lien has been filed with respect to any
such tax, fee or other charge. To its knowledge, no claim is being asserted
with respect to any such tax, fee or other charge which, in either case, could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse change with respect to the
Borrower or the Premises.

                  Section 4.10      No Burdensome Restrictions.

                  Neither the Borrower nor the Borrower Principal is a party to
or subject to any contractual obligation, security, agreement, instrument,
license or other undertaking by which the Borrower or such Borrower Principal
is bound (other than the Loan Documents) which has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets,
operations or condition, financial or otherwise, of it, or on the ability of it
to carry out its obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Lender has consented
to that certain Revolving Line of Credit entered into by Borrower Principal
under which Lender serves as Agent.

                  Section 4.11      Investment Company Act; Other Regulations.

                  Neither the Borrower nor the Borrower Principal is an
"investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither
the Borrower nor the Borrower Principal is subject




                                     -38-
<PAGE>   44

to regulation under any Requirement of Law which limits its ability to incur
Obligations, other than as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.

                  Section 4.12      Subsidiaries.

                  The Borrower has no Subsidiaries.

                  Section 4.13      Title to Premises.

                  The Borrower is seized of the Land and Improvements (and any
fixtures) in fee, or is the owner of a leasehold interest in the Land and
Improvements (and any fixtures) pursuant to a Ground Lease, and has marketable
title to any appurtenant easements and has the right to convey the same, that
title to such property is free and clear of all encumbrances except for the
Permitted Encumbrances, and that it will warrant and defend the title to such
property (except for the Permitted Encumbrances) against the claims of all
Persons. As to the balance of the Premises, the Rents and Profits and the
Intangible Personalty, the Borrower represents and warrants that it has
marketable title to such property, that it has the right to convey such
property and that it will warrant and defend such property against the claims
of all persons or parties.

                  Section 4.14      Ownership of Personalty.

                  The Borrower owns, subject to no Lien other than the Lien of
the Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents, as appropriate, all of
the Personalty.

                  Section 4.15      Financial Statements.

                  As of the date of the most recent Financial Statement
furnished to the Lender, neither the Borrower nor the Borrower Principal had
any material (a) indebtedness for borrowed money or for the deferred purchase
price of property or services, as evidenced by bonds, notes or other similar
instruments or agreements, (b) obligations as a lessee under leases which shall
have been or should be, in accordance with Required Accounting Standards,
recorded as capital leases, (c) obligations under direct or indirect guaranties
in respect of, or any obligations (contingent or otherwise) to purchase or
otherwise acquire, or otherwise to assure a creditor against loss in respect
of, indebtedness or any obligations of another of the kind referred to in
clause (a) or (b) above, (d) contingent liability or liability for taxes, or
(e) long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment, including,
without limitation, any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange
transaction, which is not, to the extent required by Required Accounting
Standards, reflected in the foregoing statements or in the notes thereto. No
sale, transfer or other disposition by the Borrower or the Borrower Principal

such party's most recent Financial Statement furnished to the Lender.

                  Section 4.16      No Change.

         written information furnished by the Borrower or the Borrower
         Principals, as the case may be, to the Lender in connection with the
         Loan Documents is accurate as of its date and as of the date so
         furnished and (b) all financial projections contained therein are
         based on reasonable and stated assumptions, and no such document
         contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state a

the date hereof; there are no contracts not fully performed, and no outstanding
bills incurred, for labor or materials used in making improvements or repairs
on the Premises, or for services of architects, surveyors or engineers incurred

         as now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any purpose
         which violates the provisions of the Regulations of such Board of

         days after written demand.

                  (d)      Condition of Premises. Keep and maintain the
         Premises in good order, condition and repair and shall make, as and

<PAGE>   48

         Improvements specifically and the condition and operation of the
         Premises generally. In connection therewith, the Borrower shall permit
         the Lender and the Lender's representatives (including an independent
         Person such as an engineer, architect, or inspector) or third parties
         making Immediate Repairs, Replacements or Additional Repairs or

         or Additional Repairs or Replacements and all materials being used in
         connection therewith, to examine all plans, specifications and shop

         Additional Repairs or Replacements which are or may be kept at the
         Premises, and to complete any Immediate Repairs, Replacements or
         Additional Repairs or Replacements. The Borrower agrees to cause all
         contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors
         reasonably to cooperate with the Lender and the Lender's
         representatives or such other Persons described above in connection
         with inspections or the completion of Immediate Repairs, Replacements
         or Additional Repairs or Replacements.

                  (g)      Reimbursement. The Borrower agrees that if it shall
         fail to pay when due any tax, assessment or charge levied or assessed
         against the Premises (other than the amount or validity of which are
         currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
         with respect to which reserves in conformity with Required Accounting
         Standards have been provided on its books) or any utility charge,
         whether public or private, or any insurance premium or if it shall
         fail to procure the Insurance required hereunder and cause the
         delivery of the insurance certificates as required herein, or if it
         shall fail to pay any other charge or fee described herein, then the
         Lender, at its option, may pay, procure or cause the delivery of the
         same. The Borrower will reimburse the Lender upon demand for any sums
         of money paid by the Lender pursuant to this Section, together with
         interest on each such payment at the default rate set forth in the
         Note and all such sums and interest thereon shall be secured hereby.

                  (h)      Environmental Assessment. Provide to the Lender from
         time-to-time, at the Borrower's sole fee, cost and expense, if the
         Lender shall ever have reason to believe that any Hazardous Material
         adversely affects the Premises, or if any Governmental Action is made
         or threatened, or if an Event of Default shall have occurred, an
         Environmental Assessment, which Environmental Assessment shall have
         been ordered by the Borrower within ten (10) days after the Lender's
         request and which shall be delivered to the Lender promptly after the
         date of the Lender's request. At all other times, the Lender may
         request an Environmental Assessment to be provided by the Borrower at
         the Lender's expense. The Borrower will cooperate with each consulting
         firm making any Environmental Assessment and will promptly supply to
         the consulting firm, from time to time upon request, all information
         available to the Borrower to facilitate the completion of the
         Environmental Assessment. If the Borrower fails to furnish the Lender
         within ten (10) days after the Lender's request with a copy of an
         agreement with an acceptable environmental consulting firm to provide
         such Environmental Assessment, or if the Borrower fails to order such
         Environmental Assessment within ten (10) days after the Lender's
         request, the Lender may cause any such Environmental Assessment to be
         made at the Borrower's fee, cost, expense and risk. The Lender may
         disclose to interested parties any information the Lender ever has
         about the environmental condition or compliance of the Premises, but
         shall be under no duty to disclose any such information except as may
         be required by law. The Lender shall be under no duty to make any
         Environmental Assessment of the Premises, and in no event




                                     -43-

         shall any such Environmental Assessment by the Lender be or give rise
         to a representation that any Hazardous Material is or is not present
         on the Premises, or that there has been or shall be compliance with
         any Hazardous Materials Law, nor shall the Borrower or any other
         Person be entitled to rely on any Environmental Assessment made by the
         Lender or at the Lender's request. The Lender owes no duty of care to
         protect the Borrower or any other Person against, or to inform them
         of, any Hazardous Material or other adverse condition affecting the
         Premises.

                  (i)      Appraisal. At all times during the term of the Loan,

         supply to the Lender, from time to time upon request, all information
         available to the Borrower to facilitate the completion of the
         Appraisal. If any Event of Default occurs, or if a casualty loss or
         governmental taking occurs and results in insurance or eminent domain
         proceeds in excess of $50,000.00 for an Individual Property, the
         Lender may, in its reasonable discretion, choose the appraiser, but
         the Borrower shall be responsible for reasonable fees payable to said
         appraiser in connection with an Appraisal of the Premises. Under all
         other circumstances, the appraiser performing any such Appraisal shall
         be engaged by the Lender, and the Lender shall be responsible for any
         fees payable to said appraiser in connection with an Appraisal of the
         Premises.

                  (j)      Surveys. Following any material, structural change
         in the exterior configuration of the Premises or any rezoning
         affecting the Premises, provide the Lender with such additional
         Surveys as reasonably requested by the Lender.

                  (k)      Other Tests. Promptly submit to the Lender copies of
         reports of all physical tests at any time made on the Land, the
         Improvements or the materials to be incorporated into the Improvements
         and shall, at the Borrower's expense, cause to be made such additional
         tests from time to time as the Lender may reasonably require after any
         change in the Premises or receipt by the Lender of any such report.

                  (l)      Taxes and Fees. Except as otherwise provided herein,
         pay or cause to be paid as they become due all taxes, general and
         special assessments (other than the amount or validity of which are
         currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
         with respect to which reserves in conformity with Required Accounting
         Standards have been provided on its books), permit fees, inspection
         fees, license fees, water and sewer charges, franchise fees and
         equipment rents against it or the Premises, and the Borrower, upon
         request of the Lender, will submit to the Lender receipts evidencing
         said payments.

                  (m)      Financial Statements and Operating Statements.
         Furnish, or cause to be furnished to the Lender, annual Financial
         Statements for Borrower and Borrower Principal. Monthly Operating
         Statements for the Premises shall be submitted to the Lender when
         requested by the Lender and for any period during which any Event of
         Default is continuing. Operating Statements for the Premises shall be
         delivered to the Lender within forty-five (45) days of the end of each
         of the Borrower's fiscal quarters, and an annual Financial Statements
         shall be submitted to the Lender within ninety (90) days (or one
         hundred twenty (120) days if such annual Financial Statements are
         audited) of the Borrower's fiscal year end in lieu of an Operating
         Statement for the Borrower's fourth fiscal quarter. Borrower Principal
         shall furnish

         Lender, on a quarterly basis, such financial information as Borrower
         Principal is required to file under any Requirements of Law. Without
         limiting any other rights available to the Lender under this Loan
         Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, in the event the
         Borrower shall fail to timely furnish the Lender any Financial
         Statement in accordance with this subsection, the Borrower shall
         promptly pay to the Lender a penalty in the amount of $1,000.00 for
         each such failure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         herein, Borrower shall cause to be provided to Lender copies of all
         financial information required to be provided to Borrower by the
         Operating Lessee pursuant to the Operating Lease.

                  (n)      Books and Records. Keep and maintain or cause to be

         records adequate to reflect correctly the results of the operation of
         the Premises and copies of all written contracts, leases and other
         instruments which affect the Premises (including, but not limited to,
         all bills, invoices and contracts for utilities, waste management
         service, telephone service and management services, rent registrations
         and all materials filed with any Governmental Authority where
         applicable). Such books, records, contracts, leases and other
         instruments shall be subject to examination and inspection at any time
         by the Lender upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (o)      Further Assurances. The Borrower shall furnish or
         cause to be furnished such further documentation or information
         (including without limitation, amendments, replacements, corrections,

         furnished to the Lender in connection with the Loan) which is (i)
         reasonably required to enable the Lender to sell the Loan, or (ii)
         reasonably deemed necessary or appropriate by the Lender in the
         exercise of its rights under any of the Loan Documents or to perfect,
         protect, maintain, preserve, continue and/or extend any Lien granted
         to the Lender under the Security Instrument or any other Loan
         Document, provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required
         to do anything that (A) has the effect of (I) changing the essential
         economic terms of the Loan set forth in the Loan Documents or (II)
         imposing greater liability under the Loan Documents, or (B) results in
         any substantial fee, cost or expense to the Borrower. In addition, the
         Borrower shall furnish or cause to be furnished such further
         documentation and information (including without limitation,
         amendments, replacements, corrections, deletions and additions to the
         Loan Documents and other materials furnished to the Lender in
         connection with the Loan) reasonably deemed necessary or appropriate
         by the Lender to correct patent mistakes in the Loan Documents,
         materials relating to title insurance policies and other insurance
         required hereunder, and the funding of the Loan, provided that any
         such further documentation or information shall be at the sole fee,
         cost and expense of the Lender.

                  (p)      Payment of Operating Expenses Premises and Operating

         under the Operating Lease, Franchise Agreements or otherwise, related

         Replacements) performed from time to time, except to the extent that
         Lender is required to pay such expenditures from any Reserve Account.

         other evidence from time to time throughout the term of the Loan, as

         the Lender to participate and appear in (at the Borrower's expense,
         including without limitation, the Lender's reasonable attorney's fees)
         any action or proceeding relating to any condemnation or other taking

         condemnation or other taking.

                  (t)      Completion of Immediate Repairs, Replacements and
         Additional Repairs or Replacements.

                           (i)      The Borrower shall commence the Immediate

                           (ii)     If the Lender determines, in its reasonable
                  discretion, that Additional Repairs or Replacements are
                  advisable in order to keep the Premises in good order and
                  repair, the Lender may send the Borrower written notice of
                  the need for making such Additional Repairs or Replacements.
                  The Borrower shall promptly commence making such Additional
                  Repairs or Replacements. If the Borrower fails to commence
                  such Additional Repairs or Replacements within thirty (30)
                  days after such notice and diligently pursue completion of
                  such Additional Repairs or Replacements, such failure shall
                  be an Event of Default under this Loan Agreement, and, in
                  addition to all other rights the Lender may have under the
                  Loan Documents upon an Event of Default, the Lender may
                  contract with third parties to make such Additional Repairs
                  or Replacements and may in its sole discretion (A) apply the
                  funds in the Repair Escrow Account and/or Replacement Reserve
                  Account toward the labor and materials necessary to complete
                  such Additional Repairs or Replacements, and/or (B) demand
                  payment for such Additional Repairs or Replacements from the
                  Borrower.

                           (iii)    In the event the Lender determines in its
                  reasonable discretion that any Immediate Repair, Replacement
                  or Additional Repair or Replacement has not been completed in
                  a workmanlike and timely manner, the Lender shall have the
                  option to withhold disbursement from the Reserve Accounts for
                  such unsatisfactory Immediate Repair, Replacement or
                  Additional Repair or Replacement and to proceed under
                  existing contracts or to contract with third parties to
                  complete such Immediate Repair, Replacement or Additional
                  Repair or Replacement and to apply the Repair Escrow Account
                  or the Replacement Reserve Account toward the labor and
                  materials necessary to complete such Immediate Repair,
                  Replacement or Additional Repair or Replacement to the
                  reasonable satisfaction of the Lender, without providing any
                  prior notice to the Borrower.

                           (iv)     In order to facilitate the Lender's
                  completion or making of the Immediate Repairs, Replacements
                  or Additional Repairs or Replacements, the Lender is granted
                  the irrevocable right to enter onto the Premises and perform
                  any and all work and labor necessary to complete or make the

                  Replacements and employ watchmen to protect the Premises from
                  damage, loss and/or theft. All sums so expended by the Lender
                  shall be deemed to have been advanced to the Borrower and
                  secured by the Security Instrument and the other Loan
                  Documents.

                           (v)      All Immediate Repairs, Replacements and
                  Additional Repairs or Replacements shall comply with all

                  Transfer and its shareholders, partners or members, as
                  applicable, and the Special Purpose Entity nature of Borrower
                  satisfies Lender's and the Rating Agency's then current
                  applicable underwriting criteria and requirements including,
                  without limitation, the requirement at the request of Lender,
                  to deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that
                  the Special Purpose Entity nature of Borrower following such
                  Transfer is in accordance with the standards of the Rating
                  Agencies or, if a Securitization has occurred, the Rating
                  Agencies rating the Securities in the Securitization

                  that directly or indirectly holds a membership interest in
                  Borrower) which result in (x) the proposed transferee, or any
                  affiliates thereof, owning in the aggregate (directly,
                  indirectly or beneficially) forty nine percent (49%) or more
                  of the interests in Borrower (or any entity directly or
                  indirectly holding a membership interest in Borrower), or (y)
                  a Transfer in the aggregate of forty nine percent (49%) or

                                    (A)      The Interest Holder shall pay to
                           the Lender all reasonable and customary expenses
                           incurred by the Lender in connection with any such

                           determined by the Lender in its reasonable judgment,
                           multiplied by the percentage of interests (direct or
                           indirect) being transferred in the Borrower. The
                           Borrower shall furnish the Lender at the Borrower's

                           including without limitation, an Appraisal or other
                           evidence satisfactory to the Lender in its
                           reasonable discretion of the value of the Premises
                           as of the date of the Transfer.

                           meet Lender's reasonable underwriting standards
                           concerning, including without limitation, its net
                           worth and operating history, as determined by Lender
                           in its sole reasonable discretion.

                                    (D)      No Transfer shall relieve the
                           Borrower of its Obligations under this Loan
                           Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         in this Loan Agreement, the Security Instrument or any other Loan
         Documents, Lender's consent shall not be required for any of the
         following sales, transfers, assignments, pledges, conveyances or
         encumbrances, provided that Lender has received payment in full of all
         its actual expenses incurred in connection therewith:

                           (i)      with respect to the REIT and any holders of
                  interests therein, directly or indirectly, (A) Transfer of

                  issuance results in a reduction of the partnership interest
                  of the REIT in the Operating Partnership, provided that,
                  after giving effect to such transfer or




                                     -50-

                  series of transfers described in (A) or (B), the REIT owns
                  more than fifty-one percent (51%) of the partnership
                  interests of the Operating Partnership or continues to be the

                  withdrawal of any rating then assigned to any Securities in a
                  Securitization;

                            (v)     with respect to any Individual Property

         of the Borrower and the expertise available to the Borrower were and
         continue to be material circumstances upon which the Lender has relied
         in connection with, and which constitute valuable consideration to the



                                     -51-

         Lender for, the extending to the Borrower of the indebtedness
         evidenced by the Note and (ii) any change in such identity or
         expertise could materially impair or jeopardize the security for the
         payment of the Note granted to the Lender by the Security Instrument
         and the other Loan Documents, as appropriate.

                  (f)      Prepayment of Rent. Accept any prepayment of rent or

         course of business) or capital contribution by the Borrower to any
         other Person, including all debt and any Obligation of any sort,
         and/or (ii) a payment or prepayment on account of, or the setting
         apart of assets for a sinking or other analogous fund for, the

                  The Borrower hereby consents to:

                  (a)      Not cause, permit or exacerbate any Prohibited
         Activities or Conditions. The Borrower represents and warrants that it
         has not at any time caused or permitted any Prohibited Activities or
         Conditions except as set forth in the Environmental Assessment and
         that to its knowledge, no Prohibited Activities or Conditions exist or
         have existed on or under the Premises. The Borrower shall take all
         appropriate steps to prevent its employees, agents, and contractors,
         and any tenants from causing, permitting, or exacerbating any
         Prohibited Activities or Conditions. The Borrower shall not lease or
         allow the sublease or use of all or any portion of the Premises to any
         tenant, subtenant or user that, in the ordinary course of its
         business, would




                                     -52-
<PAGE>   58

         cause, permit, or exacerbate any Prohibited Activities or Conditions,
         and all leases, subleases and use agreements relating to the Premises
         shall contain provisions sufficient to ensure that tenants, subtenants
         and users shall not cause, permit or exacerbate any Prohibited
         Activities or Conditions.

                  (b)      Comply in a timely manner with, and cause all
         employees, agents, and contractors of the Borrower and any other
         persons present on the Premises to so comply with, (i) any O&M Program
         now or hereafter in effect during the term of the Loan, and (ii)
         Hazardous Materials Law, so as to minimize any economic loss to the
         Premises and the Loan. The Borrower shall adopt an O&M Program with
         respect to any Hazardous Materials as required in any Environmental
         Assessment or any Governmental Action relating to the Premises, or as
         otherwise reasonably required by the Lender with respect to the
         Premises. Any O&M Program shall be performed by qualified contractors
         under the supervision of a consulting engineer hired by the Borrower
         with the prior written approval of the Lender which approval shall not
         be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. All costs and
         expenses of any O&M Program shall be paid by the Borrower, including
         without limitation the charges of such contractors and consulting
         engineer and the Lender's reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred
         in connection with the monitoring and review of the O&M Program and
         the Borrower's performance thereunder.

                  (c)      Promptly notify the Lender in writing of: (i) any
         Governmental Action it becomes aware of, (ii) any claim made or known
         by Borrower to be threatened by any third party against the Borrower,
         the Lender, or the Premises relating to loss or injury resulting from
         any occurrence or condition on the Premises or any other real property
         that could require the removal from the Premises of any Hazardous
         Materials or cause any restrictions on the ownership, occupancy,
         transferability or use of the Premises under Hazardous Materials Law,
         or (iii) the occurrence of any Prohibited Activities or Conditions.
         The Borrower shall cooperate with any governmental inquiry, and shall
         comply with any governmental or judicial order, request or directive
         which arises from any alleged Prohibited Activities or Conditions;
         provided that with respect to governmental requests or directives
         only, the Borrower may contest or object to a good faith dispute
         regarding said request or directive if the Borrower notifies the
         Lender in advance of said contest or objection and as long as said
         contest or objection does not result in a violation of law or fines
         assessed against the Premises unless such fines are bonded by Borrower
         in a manner acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion.

                  (d)      Pay promptly all reasonable costs and expenses
         incurred by the Lender in connection with any Governmental Action,
         including but not limited to costs of any environmental audits,
         studies, investigations or remedial activities including but not
         limited to the removal of any Hazardous Materials from the Premises.
         The Borrower also shall pay promptly the costs of any environmental
         audits, studies, investigations or the removal of any Hazardous
         Materials from the Premises required by the Lender as a condition of
         its consent to any sale or transfer of all or any part of the Premises
         or any interest therein or required by the Lender following a
         reasonable determination by the Lender that there may be Prohibited
         Activities or Conditions on or under the Premises. Any such reasonable
         costs or expenses incurred by the Lender (including but not limited to
         reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and consultants, whether
         incurred in connection with any judicial or administrative process or



                                     -53-
<PAGE>   59

         otherwise) which the Borrower fails to pay promptly shall become
         additional indebtedness secured by the Security Instrument.

         RESULT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF LENDER, HOLD
         HARMLESS, DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY THE LENDER AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
         TRUSTEES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES (INCLUDING ANY PARENT
         CORPORATION), SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, FROM AND AGAINST ALL
         PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES
         (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION REASONABLE FEES AND EXPENSES OF
         ATTORNEYS AND EXPERT WITNESSES, INVESTIGATORY FEES, AND CLEANUP AND
         REMEDIATION EXPENSES, WHETHER INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY JUDICIAL
         OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS OR OTHERWISE), ARISING DIRECTLY OR
         INDIRECTLY FROM (i) ANY BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR
         OBLIGATION OF THE BORROWER CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 5.3 OR (ii) THE
         PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ON OR UNDER THE PREMISES OR ANY
         PROPERTY PROXIMATE TO THE PREMISES OR ANY GOVERNMENTAL ACTION ALLEGING
         ANY SUCH PRESENCE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BORROWER CAN
         CONCLUSIVELY PROVE BOTH THAT SUCH PRESENCE OR GOVERNMENTAL ACTION
         ALLEGING SUCH PRESENCE WAS CAUSED SOLELY BY ACTIONS, CONDITIONS, OR
         EVENTS THAT OCCURRED AFTER THE DATE THAT THE LENDER (OR ANY PURCHASER
         AT A FORECLOSURE SALE) ACTUALLY ACQUIRED TITLE OR TOOK POSSESSION TO
         THE PREMISES AND THAT SUCH PRESENCE OR GOVERNMENTAL ACTION ALLEGING
         SUCH PRESENCE WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT ACTIONS OF THE
         BORROWER OR THE BORROWER PRINCIPAL, OR ANY PARTNER, MEMBER, PRINCIPAL,
         OFFICER, DIRECTOR, TRUSTEE OR MANAGER OF THE BORROWER OR ANY EMPLOYEE,
         AGENT, CONTRACTOR OR AFFILIATE OF THE BORROWER OR THE BORROWER
         PRINCIPAL. THE OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF THE BORROWER UNDER THIS
         SECTION 5.3(e) SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION, SATISFACTION,
         ASSIGNMENT, ENTRY OF A JUDGMENT OF FORECLOSURE OR DELIVERY OF A DEED
         IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE OF THE SECURITY INSTRUMENT.

                  Except as otherwise expressly permitted by the Loan
Documents, during any period in which the Loan is outstanding, the Borrower
agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the Lender:

                  (a)      Sale, Transfer, Conveyance or Disposal. Permit any

         Rents and Profits or the Intangible Personalty.

                  (b)      Other Financing and Liens. Engage in any other
         financing with respect to the Borrower (except payables incurred with
         trade creditors in amounts not to exceed $100,000.00, provided such
         debt is not evidenced by a note and is not in excess of sixty days
         past due in the ordinary course of business and paid prior to
         delinquency), the Premises, the

         Rents and Profits or the Intangible Personalty or grant any consensual
         Liens against the Premises, the Rents and Profits or the Intangible
         Personalty. Nor shall Borrower or any member or partner of Borrower
         pledge any interest in Borrower without the prior written consent of
         Lender and without written confirmation from applicable Rating
         Agencies that such pledge will not result in a downgrade,
         qualification or withdrawal of the initial, or, if higher, then
         current ratings assigned to the Securities by such Rating Agency.

                  (c)      Special Purpose Entity. Fail to be a Special Purpose
         Entity.

                  Section  5.5      Insurance.

         shall cause, at no cost or expense to Lender, keep in full force and
         effect all Insurance. If the Borrower fails to maintain, or cause to
         be maintained, any Insurance required by this Agreement, the Lender
         may, at its option, procure such Insurance, and the Borrower shall
         reimburse the Lender for the amount of all premiums paid by the Lender
         thereon promptly upon demand by the Lender, with interest thereon at
         the rate then provided by the Note from the date paid by the Lender to
         the date of repayment, and such sum shall be a part of the
         indebtedness secured by the Security Instrument. The Lender shall not
         by the fact of approving, disapproving, accepting, preventing,
         obtaining or failing to obtain any Insurance, incur any liability for
         or with respect to the amount of Insurance carried, the form or legal
         sufficiency of insurance contracts, solvency of insurance companies,
         or payment or defense of lawsuits, and the Borrower, for itself,
         hereby expressly assumes full responsibility therefor and all
         liability, if any, with respect thereto.

                  (b)      Insurance with Respect to Immediate Repairs,
         Replacements and Additional Repairs or Replacements. In addition to
         and to the extent not covered by any Insurance required under the Loan
         Documents, the Borrower shall provide or cause to be provided worker's
         compensation insurance, builder's risk, and public liability insurance
         and other insurance to the extent required under applicable law in
         connection with a particular Immediate Repair, Replacement or
         Additional Repair or Replacement reasonably required by the Lender.

                  (c)      Approved Insurers. Each of the Borrower's insurers
         shall be an Approved Insurer. If any of the Borrower's insurers shall
         at any time cease to be an Approved Insurer, then within thirty (30)
         days after notice from the Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower will
         obtain replacement Insurance or additional Insurance issued by one or
         more other Approved Insurers.

                  (d)      Form of Insurance Policies; Endorsements. All
         policies for Insurance shall be in such form and with such
         endorsements as are comparable to the forms of and endorsements to the
         Borrower's, or if applicable, its tenant's, insurance policies in
         effect on the date hereof or otherwise in accordance with commercially
         reasonable standards applied by prudent owners of similar businesses
         in the general vicinity of the Premises and generally acceptable to
         institutional lenders for comparable properties and risks. All such
         policies shall name the Lender, and its successors and assigns, as
         additional insureds, mortgagees and/or loss payees, as deemed
         appropriate by the Lender, and shall provide that all proceeds are
         payable to the Lender (except for any "non-property" insurance
         policies maintained by the Operating




                                     -55-

         Lessee) and shall contain: (i) a standard "non-contributory mortgagee"
         endorsement or its equivalent relating, inter alia, to recovery by the
         Lender notwithstanding the negligent or willful acts or omissions of
         the named Borrower; (ii) to the extent available at commercially
         reasonable rates, a waiver of subrogation endorsement as to the
         Lender; (iii) an endorsement providing that no policy shall be
         impaired or invalidated by virtue of any act, failure to act,
         negligence of, or violation of declarations, warranties or conditions
         contained in such policy by the Borrower, any tenant at the Premises,
         the Lender or any other named insured, additional insured, mortgagee
         or loss payee, except for the willful misconduct of the Lender
         knowingly in violation of the conditions of such policy; (iv) an
         endorsement providing for a deductible per loss of an amount not more
         than that which is customarily maintained by prudent owners of similar
         businesses in the general vicinity of the Premises; (v) a provision
         that such policies shall not be canceled or amended, including,
         without limitation, any amendment reducing the scope or limits of
         coverage, without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to
         the Lender in each instance, and (vi) effective waivers by the insurer
         of all claims for insurance premiums against any loss payees,
         additional insureds, mortgagees and named insureds (other than the
         Borrower). Any insurance coverage relating to the Premises that is
         carried by the Borrower or, if applicable, its tenant's, in excess of
         the Insurance required hereunder shall name the Lender, and its
         successors and assigns, as additional insureds, mortgagees and/or loss
         payees, as appropriate, as provided herein. A certificate executed by
         the Borrower's insurance consultant and other evidence of Insurance
         required by the Lender shall be delivered to the Lender not less than
         ten (10) days prior to the expiration date of any of the policies for
         Insurance required to be maintained hereunder which certificate and
         other evidence shall certify payment of applicable premiums for
         renewal and replacement policies. The Borrower may effect any
         Insurance required hereunder through blanket insurance policies. The
         Borrower shall deliver to the Lender certified copies of all policies
         for Insurance which shall be taken out upon the Premises while any
         part of the Loan shall remain unpaid.

                  (e)      Compliance with Insurance Policy Terms. The Borrower
         shall comply with all terms of policies for Insurance and shall not
         bring or keep or permit to be brought or kept any article upon the
         Premises or cause or permit any condition to exist thereon which would
         be prohibited by or could invalidate any Insurance required hereunder.

                  Section 5.6       Lockbox.

                  The Borrower has established as of the date hereof the
Lockbox Account, which Lockbox Account shall, in all respects, be governed by
the Cash Management Agreement.


                                  ARTICLE VI
                               RESERVE ACCOUNTS

                  Section 6.1       Establishment of Reserve Accounts.

                  On or before the Closing Date, the Lender shall establish
each Reserve Account. Each Reserve Account shall be under the sole dominion and
control of the Lender.




                                     -56-
<PAGE>   62

                  Section 6.2       Initial Reserve Deposits.

                  On the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender for
deposit into each Reserve Account any Initial Reserve Deposit applicable to
such Reserve Account.

                  Section 6.3       Monthly Reserve Deposits.

                  On each Payment Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender
for deposit into each Reserve Account any Monthly Reserve Deposit applicable to
such Reserve Account. The Lender may, upon written request from the Borrower,
waive any requirement for the payment of a Monthly Reserve Deposit, provided
however, that any such waiver by the Lender of a requirement that the Borrower
pay such Monthly Reserve Deposit may be revoked by the Lender, in the Lender's
sole discretion, at any time upon notice in writing to the Borrower.

                  Section 6.4       Replacement Reserve Account.

                  The Lender may, in the Lender's reasonable discretion, adjust
the Monthly Reserve Deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account from time to
time to an amount sufficient, in the Lender's reasonable judgment, to maintain
adequate balances necessary for Replacements, including, without limitation,
Additional Repairs or Replacements made pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Agreement and consistent with the requirements of the applicable Franchise
Agreement and Operating Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the
Lender shall at any time increase the Monthly Reserve Deposit to the
Replacement Reserve Account over the Monthly Reserve Deposit to the Replacement
Reserve Account then required pursuant to Exhibit B hereto, the Borrower, may
at its election, request that the Lender obtain, at the sole cost, fee and
expense of the Borrower, an engineering report from an engineer to be selected
by the Lender in its reasonable discretion, in which case the Monthly Reserve
Deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account shall be adjusted by the Lender
based on such engineering report, provided that in no event shall the Monthly
Reserve Deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account be decreased below the
applicable amount set forth on Exhibit B hereto. Following any defeasance of
any permitted portion of the Premises, or substitution of properties pursuant
to Section 2.6 hereof, and upon written request from Borrower, Lender will, at
Borrower's expense, commission an updated engineering report (from an engineer
selected by Lender) of the remaining portion of the Premises and, subject to
Lender's review and approval, the amount of the Monthly Deposit to the
Replacement Reserve Account shall be adjusted to reflect that the defeased
portion of the Premises no longer serves as collateral for the Loan.

                  Section 6.5       Permitted Investments, Earnings, Charges and
Annual Accounting.

                  (a)      Permitted Investments. The Lender may invest and
         reinvest, or cause to be invested or reinvested, all or any portion of
         any funds on deposit in any Reserve Account in Permitted Investments.
         The maturities of the Permitted Investments on deposit in any Reserve
         Account shall be selected and coordinated to become due not later than
         the day before any disbursements from any Reserve Account must be
         made. All such Permitted Investments shall be held in the name and be
         under the sole dominion and control of the Lender, to the extent
         permitted by applicable laws, and no Permitted Investment shall be
         made unless the Lender shall




                                     -57-
<PAGE>   63

         perfect its first priority Lien in such Permitted Investment and, to
         the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Lender shall have sole
         possession and control over each such Permitted Investment and the
         income thereon, and any certificate or other instrument or document
         evidencing any such investment shall be delivered directly to the
         Lender, together with any document of transfer necessary to transfer
         title to such investment to the Lender. The Lender shall not have any
         liability (other than for the Lender's gross negligence or willful
         misconduct) for any loss in investments of funds in any Reserve
         Account that are invested in Permitted Investments and no such loss
         shall affect the Borrower's obligation to (i) make any payment
         hereunder, under the Security Instrument, the Note or any other Loan
         Document, or (ii) fund, or have liability for funding, any Reserve
         Account. The Borrower agrees that it shall include all interest,
         earnings or profits on Permitted Investments of funds on deposit in
         any Reserve Account as its income (and, if the Borrower is a
         partnership or other pass-through entity, the partners, members or
         beneficiaries of the Borrower, as the case may be), and shall be the
         owner of such accounts for federal and applicable state and local tax
         purposes, except to the extent the Lender retains such interest,
         earnings or profits for its own account in accordance with the
         provisions of Section 6.5(b) of this Loan Agreement. The Borrower
         shall have no right whatsoever to direct the investment of the
         proceeds in any Reserve Account.

                  (b)      Earnings. All interest, earnings or profits on the
         Permitted Investments of funds in any of the Reserve Accounts shall be
         deposited into the applicable Reserve Account, provided that the
         Lender may, at its election, retain for its own account any such
         interest, earnings or profits (i) on the Tax and Insurance Reserve
         Account, and (ii) on any or all of the Reserve Accounts during the
         occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default.

                  (c)      Charges. Except as prohibited by applicable laws,
         the Lender may charge the Borrower for holding, maintaining and
         applying funds in any of the Reserve Accounts to the extent funds on
         deposit in such Reserve Account are invested or reinvested in
         Permitted Investments and the Lender does not retain for its own
         account any interest, earnings or profits on such Reserve Account in
         accordance with the provisions of Section 6.5(b) of this Loan
         Agreement.

                  (d)      Annual Accounting. The Lender shall furnish or cause
         to be furnished to the Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting
         of each Reserve Account in the normal format of the Lender or its
         agent, showing credits and debits to such Reserve Account and the
         purpose for which each debit to such Reserve Account was made.

                  Section  6.6      Assignment to the Lender of Reserve
Accounts and Rights and Claims.

                  (a)      The Borrower hereby assigns to the Lender the
         Reserve Accounts as additional security for all of the Borrower's
         Obligations to the Lender, under the Note and under the other Loan
         Documents; provided, however, the Lender shall make disbursements from
         the Reserve Accounts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
         including without limitation, the Program Rider.



                                     -58-
<PAGE>   64

                  (b)      The Borrower assigns to the Lender all rights and
         claims the Borrower may have against (i) all persons or entities
         claiming amounts due for taxes, utilities, rent or insurance, or (ii)
         all persons or entities supplying labor or materials in connection
         with the Immediate Repairs, Replacements or Additional Repairs or
         Replacements; provided, however, that the Lender may not pursue any
         such right or claim unless an Event of Default exists under this
         Agreement or the Loan Documents.

                  Section  6.7      Application of Reserve Accounts Upon an
Event of Default.

                  If any Event of Default occurs, then the Borrower shall
immediately lose all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve
Accounts unless and until the earlier to occur of or concurrently with (a) the
date on which such Event of Default is fully cured, and (b) the date on which
all amounts secured by the Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents
have been paid in full and the lien of the Security Instrument and the other
Loan Documents, as appropriate, have been released by the Lender. Upon any
Event of Default, the Lender may in its sole discretion, use the Reserve
Accounts (or any portion thereof) for any purpose, including but not limited to
(i) repayment of any indebtedness secured by the Security Instrument and the
other Loan Documents, including but not limited to principal prepayments and
the prepayment premium applicable to such full or partial prepayment (as
applicable); provided, however, that such application of funds shall not cure
or be deemed to cure any Event of Default, (ii) reimbursement of the Lender for
all losses, fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
legal fees) suffered or incurred by the Lender as a result of such Event of
Default, (iii) payment of any amount expended in exercising all rights and
remedies available to the Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or
under any of the other Loan Documents, or (iv) to the payment of any item for
which payment is required or permitted from any of the Reserve Accounts
pursuant to the terms of this Loan Agreement. Nothing in this Loan Agreement
shall obligate the Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve Accounts
on account of any Event of Default by the Borrower or to pay the indebtedness
secured by the Security Instrument or any of the other Loan Documents or in any
specific order of priority.

                  Section 6.8       Disbursements from Tax and Insurance
Reserve Account.

                  (a)      The Lender shall disburse, to the extent of amounts
         on deposit in the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account, directly to each
         Person owed any portion of the water and sewer assessments and
         frontage charges, taxes, assessments and insurance premiums, the total
         sum owed to such Person. Such disbursements shall be made by the
         Lender (i) so as to coincide in frequency with the regular billing
         cycle of such Person, and (ii) on or before the date that each such
         payment is due.

                  (b)      The Lender may require the Borrower to pay to the
         Lender in advance, additional amounts for taxes, charges, premiums,
         assessments, and impositions in connection with the Borrower or the
         Premises which the Lender shall reasonably deem necessary. Unless
         otherwise provided by applicable law, the Lender may require payments
         for such other amounts to be paid by the Borrower in a lump sum or
         periodic installments, at the Lender's option.




                                     -59-
<PAGE>   65

                  (c)      If the amount held in the Tax and Insurance Reserve
         Account at the time of the annual accounting thereof shall exceed the
         amount deemed necessary by the Lender to provide for the payment of
         water and sewer assessments and frontage charges, taxes, assessments,
         impositions and insurance premiums, as they fall due, such excess
         shall be credited against future Monthly Reserve Deposits to the Tax
         and Insurance Reserve Account. If at any time the amount held in the
         Tax and Insurance Reserve Account shall be less than the amount deemed
         necessary by the Lender to pay water and sewer assessments and
         frontage charges, taxes, assessments, impositions and insurance
         premiums, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender any amount necessary to
         make up the deficiency within thirty (30) days after notice from the
         Lender to the Borrower requesting payment thereof.

                  (d)      Upon payment in full of all amounts owed by the
         Borrower under or otherwise secured by any of the Loan Documents, all
         remaining amounts on deposit, if any, in the Tax and Insurance Reserve
         Account shall be distributed to the Borrower.

                  Section 6.9       Disbursements from Repair Escrow Account and
Replacement Reserve Account.

                  (a)      Upon written request from the Borrower and
         satisfaction of the requirements set forth in this Loan Agreement, the
         Lender shall disburse to the Borrower amounts from the Repair Escrow
         Account necessary to reimburse the Borrower for the actual costs of
         Immediate Repairs and shall disburse amounts from the Replacement
         Reserve Account necessary to reimburse the Borrower for the actual
         costs of Replacements (but, as to any Immediate Repair or Replacement,
         such amount shall not exceed one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of
         the original estimated cost of such Immediate Repair and/or
         Replacement set forth on Exhibit B to this Loan Agreement, unless the
         Lender agrees to such reimbursement).

                  (b)      Upon written request from the Borrower, the Lender
         may, in its discretion, disburse amounts from the Repair Escrow
         Account and/or Replacement Reserve Account to reimburse the Borrower
         for the actual cost of labor and materials associated with an
         Additional Repair or Replacement. Each such request from the Borrower
         shall include a statement regarding why such disbursement should be
         made. If the Lender determines that (i) such Additional Repair or
         Replacement is of the type intended to be covered by this Agreement,
         (ii) the costs for such Additional Repair or Replacement are
         reasonable, (iii) the amount of funds in the Repair Escrow Account
         and/or the Replacement Reserve Account, as applicable, is sufficient
         to pay the Additional Repair or Replacement and one hundred
         twenty-five percent (125%) of the then current estimated cost of
         completing all remaining Immediate Repairs and Replacements, as
         applicable, and (iv) all other conditions for disbursement under this
         Loan Agreement have been met, then the Lender shall disburse funds
         from the Repair Escrow Account and/or the Replacement Reserve Account,
         as applicable, for such Additional Repair or Replacement in accordance
         with the requirements of this Loan Agreement for Immediate Repairs
         and/or Replacements.

                  (c)      Each request for disbursement from the Repair Escrow
         Account or Replacement Reserve Account shall be in a form specified or
         approved by the Lender and shall set forth (i) the specific Immediate
         Repairs, Replacements or Additional Repair or Replacement,




                                     -60-
<PAGE>   66

         as the case may be, for which the disbursement is requested, (ii) the
         quantity and price of each item purchased, if the Immediate Repair,
         Replacement or Additional Repair or Replacement, as the case may be,
         includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (iii) the
         price of all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any
         Immediate Repair, Replacement or Additional Repair or Replacement, as
         the case may be, other than the purchase or replacement of specific
         items, and (iv) the cost of all contracted labor or other services
         applicable to each Immediate Repair, Replacement or Additional Repair
         or Replacement, as the case may be, for which such request for
         disbursement is made. With each request the Borrower shall certify
         that all Immediate Repairs, Replacements or Additional Repairs or
         Replacements, as the case may be, have been made in accordance with
         the requirements of this Loan Agreement and all Requirements of Laws.
         Each request for disbursement shall include (A) copies of invoices for
         all items or materials purchased and all contracted labor or services
         provided, and (B) for disbursements in excess of $25,000, such
         acknowledgments of payment, lien waivers and/or releases with respect
         to the Immediate Repairs, Replacements and Additional Repairs or
         Replacements for which disbursement is requested as the Lender may
         require. In connection with each disbursement from the Repair Escrow
         Account or the Replacement Reserve Account, as the case may be, the
         Lender may require the Borrower to provide the Lender with an
         endorsement to the Lender's title insurance policy showing that no
         Liens have been placed against the Premises since the date of
         recordation of the Security Instrument (other than Permitted
         Encumbrances and any other Liens previously approved in writing by the
         Lender, if any).

                  (d)      Except as provided in the following sentence, each
         request for disbursement from the Repair Escrow Account or the
         Replacement Reserve Account shall be made only after completion (as
         reasonably determined by the Lender) of the Immediate Repair,
         Replacement or Additional Repair or Replacement for which disbursement
         is requested. If (i) the cost of the Immediate Repair, Replacement or
         Additional Repair or Replacement exceeds the lesser of (A) one percent
         (1%) of the original Loan Amount, or (B) $50,000.00 per Individual
         Property, (ii) the written contract with respect to such Immediate
         Repair, Replacement or Additional Repair or Replacement requires
         periodic payment for such work pursuant to the terms thereof, and
         (iii) the Lender has approved in writing in advance such periodic
         payments, then a request for reimbursement from the Repair Escrow
         Account and/or Replacement Reserve Account may be made after
         completion of a portion of the work under such contract, provided (1)
         the materials for which the request is made are on site at the
         Premises and are properly secured or have been installed in the
         Premises, (2) all other conditions in this Loan Agreement for
         disbursement have been satisfied, and (3) funds remaining in the
         Repair Escrow Account or the Replacement Reserve Account, as the case
         may be, are, in the Lender's reasonable judgment, sufficient to
         complete such Immediate Repair, Replacement or Additional Repair or
         Replacement and all the other Immediate Repairs and/or Replacements
         when required. The Lender, at its option, may issue joint checks,
         payable to the Borrower and the supplier, materialman, mechanic,
         contractor, subcontractor or other party to whom payment is due in
         connection with any such periodic payment for an Immediate Repair,
         Replacement or Additional Repair or Replacement to be paid from the
         Repair Escrow Account or Replacement Reserve Account, as the case may
         be.

         pay the Lender a reasonable inspection fee not exceeding $1,000.00 for
         each such inspection.

                  (g)      The Lender shall not be obligated to make

Lender harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands,
counterclaims, cross-claims, liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, fees

                  two (2) years prior to the Maturity Date;

                           (vi)     the Lender will not incur any liability to
                  any other Person as a result of such use or release of
                  proceeds; and

                           (vii)    (a) as to any casualty loss, the insurance
                  proceeds shall be held by the Lender and disbursed as repair,
                  restoration, replacement or rebuilding progresses
                  substantially in accordance with the procedures set forth in
                  this Loan Agreement for disbursement from the Replacement
                  Reserve Account; provided, however that insurance proceeds of
                  $150,000 for any Individual Property or less will be
                  disbursed directly to the Borrower for repair, restoration,
                  replacement or rebuilding and (B) as to any condemnation
                  award, the condemnation award or proceeds shall be held by

                  and disbursed as repair, restoration, replacement or
                  rebuilding progresses substantially in accordance with the
                  procedures set forth in this Loan Agreement for disbursement
                  from the Replacement Reserve Account.

                  (b)      If the above-stated conditions are not satisfied
         within ninety (90) days of loss, then the Lender may, at its option,
         apply any proceeds in repayment of the amount then outstanding under
         the Note.

                  (c)      Upon the completion of any repair, restoration,
         replacement or rebuilding any remaining proceeds shall be paid to the
         Lender in repayment of the amount then outstanding under the Note in
         accordance with the provisions of the Note.


                                  ARTICLE IX
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

                  Section 9.1       Remedies Cumulative; Waivers.

                  All remedies of the Lender provided for herein and/or in the
other Loan Documents are cumulative and shall be in addition to any and all
other rights and remedies provided for or available under the other Loan
Documents, at law and/or in equity. The exercise of any right or remedy by the
Lender hereunder shall not in any way constitute a cure or waiver of any
Default Condition or Event of Default hereunder or under any other Loan
Document, or invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of the occurrence
of any Default Condition or Event of Default, or prejudice the Lender in the
exercise of any of its rights hereunder or under or any other Loan Document,
unless, in the exercise of said rights, the Lender realizes all amounts owed to
it under the Loan Documents. No waiver of any Default Condition or Event of
Default hereunder shall be implied from any delay or omission by the Lender to
take action on account of such Default Condition or Event of Default, and no
express waiver shall affect any Default Condition or Event of Default other
than the Default Condition or Event of Default specified in the waiver and it
shall be operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers
of any covenants, terms or conditions contained herein must be in writing and
shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent failure to observe or
comply with the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by
the Lender to or of any act by the Borrower requiring further consent or
approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the consent or
approval to or of any subsequent or similar act.

                  Section 9.2       Benefit.

                  This Loan Agreement is made and entered into for the sole
protection and benefit of the Lender and the Borrower, their successors and
permitted assigns, and no other Person or Persons shall have any right to
action hereon or rights to the Loan proceeds at any time, nor shall the Lender
owe any duty whatsoever to any claimant for labor performed or material
furnished in connection with the construction of the Improvements, or to apply
any undisbursed portion of the Loan to the payment of any such claim, or to
exercise any right or power of the Lender hereunder or arising from any Default
Condition or Event of Default by the Borrower.

                  Section 9.3       Assignment and Assumption.

                  (a)      The terms hereof shall be binding upon and inure to
         the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns, and personal
         representatives of the parties hereto.

                  (b)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 2.5, 2.6, 5.2
         and 10.1(c) hereof, neither Borrower nor any other Person having
         beneficial or ownership interest in Borrower shall assign or permit
         any assumption of this Loan Agreement, any of the other Loan
         Documents, the Loan or any of its rights, interests, duties or
         obligations hereunder or thereunder or any Loan proceeds or other sums
         to be advanced hereunder in whole or in part without the prior written
         consent of the Lender. Lender shall consent, no more than once, to
         such assignment and/or assumption to a qualified borrower acceptable
         to Lender at its sole discretion upon the payment to the Lender of all
         reasonable and customary expenses incurred by the Lender in connection
         with any such assignment and/or assumption and of a processing fee in
         an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the outstanding principal
         amount of the Loan as of the date the Borrower requests the Lender to
         consent to such assignment or assumption. Any assignment or assumption
         (whether voluntary or by operation of law) without said consent shall
         be void. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, in no event shall
         the Lender consent to any assignment or assumption requested or
         occurring prior to the sale of the Loan by the Lender in the secondary
         market if the consideration paid or to be paid by the assignee or
         purchaser of the Premises in connection therewith, as determined by
         the Lender in its reasonable judgment, is less than the appraised
         value of the Premises used by the Lender in underwriting the Loan. The
         Borrower shall furnish the Lender at the Borrower's sole cost and
         expense such information as the Lender shall request in connection
         with any assignment or assumption, including without limitation: (i)
         an Appraisal or other evidence satisfactory to the Lender in its
         reasonable discretion of the value of the Premises as of the date of
         the assignment and/or assumption; (ii) confirmation from the Rating
         Agencies that the credit ratings of Securities immediately prior to
         assignment and/or assumption will not be qualified, downgraded or
         withdrawn as a result of such assignment and/or assumption, which
         affirmation may be granted or withheld in the Rating Agencies sole and
         absolute discretion; (iii) evidence that the assignee is a Special
         Purpose Entity satisfying Lender's and Rating Agency's then current
         applicable underwriting criteria and requirements; and (iv) delivery
         of a "non-consolidation" opinion in form and substance satisfactory to
         Lender that, in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding involving any
         Affiliate of Borrower, the assets of the Borrower, including the
         Premises, shall not be substantively consolidated with the assets of
         the Affiliate. Lender further reserves the right to condition the
         consent to any assignment or assumption upon (i) payment of all of
         Lender's reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such
         transfer; (ii) the confirmation in writing by the applicable Rating
         Agencies that the proposed transfer will not, in and of itself, result
         in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of the initial, or, if
         higher, then current respective ratings in effect immediately prior to
         such assignment or assumption for the Securities issued in connection
         with a securitization; (iii) the delivery of a non-consolidation
         opinion reflecting the proposed transfer satisfactory in form and
         substance satisfactory to Lender that, in the event of a bankruptcy
         proceeding involving any Affiliate of Borrower, the assets of the
         Borrower, including the Premises, shall not be substantively
         consolidated with the assets of the Affiliate to Lender in its sole
         discretion; and (iv) the delivery to Lender of such additional
         documents, certificates and legal opinions as it may reasonably
         request. In addition, the assignee or purchaser of the




                                     -69-
<PAGE>   75

         Premises shall be required to assume the Borrower's duties and
         obligations under this Loan Agreement and shall be required to execute
         and deliver to the Lender such documents, opinions, certificates and
         information as the Lender reasonably requires to effectuate such
         assumption of duties and obligations. No sale, assignment or
         assumption shall relieve the Borrower of its Obligations under this
         Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, unless the Borrower
         has obtained the prior written consent of the Lender, which consent
         shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                  (c)      Lender shall have the right to sell, assign or
         otherwise transfer the Loan or any portion thereof or interest therein
         held by Lender without the consent of Borrower or Owner or the
         satisfaction of any other requirement with respect to Borrower or
         Owner. At the request of the holder of the Note and, to the extent not
         already required to be provided by Borrower or Owner under this
         agreement or the Security Instrument, Borrower and Owner shall use
         reasonable efforts to satisfy the market standards to which the holder
         of the Note customarily adheres or which may be reasonably required in
         the marketplace or by the Rating Agencies of the Note or participation
         therein or the first successful public or private securitization (such
         sale and/or securitization, the "Securitization") of rated single or
         multi-class Securities secured by or evidencing ownership interests in
         the Note and the Security Instrument, including, without limitation,
         to:

                           1.       (i) provide such financial and other
                  information with respect to the Premises, the Borrower and
                  the Owner, (ii) provide budgets relating to the Premises and
                  (iii) to permit to be performed or permitted such site
                  inspection, appraisals, market studies, environmental reviews
                  and reports (Phase I reports and, if appropriate, Phase II
                  reports), engineering reports and other due diligence
                  investigations of the Premises, as may be reasonably
                  requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or
                  as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection
                  with the Securitization (the "Provided Information"),
                  together, if customary, with appropriate verification of
                  and/or consents to the use of the Provided Information
                  through letters of auditors or opinions of counsel of
                  independent attorneys reasonably acceptable to the Lender and
                  acceptable to the Rating Agencies; provided, however, that
                  Phase II reports and other invasive testing may not be
                  performed at the Premises until Borrower has received
                  reasonably appropriate and evidence of insurance from any
                  Person preparing such report or performing such testing;

                           2.       cause counsel to render opinions as to
                  non-consolidation, fraudulent conveyance, and true sale or
                  any other opinion customary in securitization transactions
                  with respect to the Premises, the Borrower, the Owner and
                  their Affiliates, which counsel and opinions shall be
                  reasonably satisfactory to the holder of the Note and the
                  Rating Agencies;

                           3.       make such representations and warranties as
                  of the closing date of the Securitization with respect to the
                  Premises, the Borrower, the Owner and the Loan Documents as
                  are customarily provided in securitization transactions and
                  as may be reasonably requested by the holder of the Note or
                  the Rating Agencies and consistent with the facts covered by
                  such representations and warranties as they exist on the date



                                     -70-
<PAGE>   76

                  thereof to the extent such representations and warranties are
                  true as of the closing date of the Securitization, including
                  the representations and warranties made in the Loan Documents
                  to the extent such representations and warranties are true as
                  of the closing date of the Securitization; and

                           4.       execute such agreements and amendments to
                  the Loan Documents and organizational documents and enter
                  into a lockbox or similar arrangement with respect to the
                  rents from the Premises as may be reasonably requested by the
                  holder of the Note or as may be requested by the Rating
                  Agencies or as may be otherwise necessary to effect the
                  Securitization; provided, however, that the Borrower shall
                  not be required to modify or amend any Loan Document if such
                  modification or amendment would (i) change the interest rate,
                  the stated maturity or the amortization of principal set
                  forth in the Note, or (ii) modify or amend any other material
                  economic term of the Loan or materially increase Borrower's
                  or Owner's obligations or liabilities under the Loan
                  Documents.

                  All third party costs and expenses incurred by Lender in
connection with the Securitization or other sale or transfer of the Loan and
all reasonable third party costs and expenses incurred by Borrower or Owner in
connection with the Securitization or other sale or transfer of the Loan shall
be paid by Lender.

                  Section 9.4       Securitization Cooperation/Indemnification.

                  (a)      Borrower understands that certain of the Provided
         Information and the books and records delivered to Lender pursuant to
         Section 5.1(n) hereof, (the "Required Records") may be included in
         disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization, including,
         without limitation, a prospectus or private placement memorandum
         (each, a "Disclosure Document") and may also be included in filings
         with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities
         Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Securities and
         Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or provided or
         made available to investors or prospective investors in the
         Securities, the Rating Agencies, and service providers relating to the
         Securitization. In the event that the Disclosure Document is required
         to be revised prior to the sale of all Securities, the Borrower will
         cooperate with the holder of the Note in updating the Disclosure
         Document by providing all current information necessary to keep the
         Disclosure Document accurate and complete in all material respects.

                  (b)      Borrower agrees to provide in connection with each
         of (i) a preliminary and a private placement memorandum or (ii) a
         preliminary and final prospectus, as applicable, an indemnification
         certificate (A) certifying that Borrower has carefully examined such
         memorandum or prospectus, as applicable but only as such memorandum or
         prospectus, relates to the Premises, the Borrower, the Borrower
         Principal or their Affiliates, including without limitation, the
         sections entitled "Special Considerations," "Description of the
         Security Instruments," "Description of the Loans and Properties," "The
         Manager," "The Borrower" and "Certain Legal Aspects of the Loan," and
         such sections (and any other sections reasonably requested) do not,
         and with respect to any portions of such sections prepared in reliance
         upon the reports of third parties, to Borrower's knowledge do not,
         contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
         material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in




                                     -71-

         the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
         misleading, (B) indemnifying Lender, subject to Section 9.5 (and for
         purposes of this Section 9.4, Lender hereunder shall include its
         officers, directors and employees), the Affiliate of such Lender
         entity (the "Lender Entity") that has filed the registration statement
         relating to the securitization (the "Registration Statement"), each of
         its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration
         Statement and each person or entity who controls the Affiliate within
         the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
         Exchange Act (collectively, the "Lender Group"), and Lender Entity,
         each of its directors and each person who controls Lender Entity
         within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20
         of the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Underwriter Group") for any
         losses, claims, damages or liabilities (the "Liabilities") to which
         Lender, the Lender Group or the Underwriter Group may become subject
         insofar as the Liabilities arise out of any untrue statement or
         alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in such
         sections (other than any such statement made in reliance upon the
         reports of third parties that do not, to Borrower's knowledge, contain
         any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
         fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
         circumstances under which they were made, not misleading) or arise out
         of the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
         known to Borrower and required to be stated in such sections or
         necessary in order to make the statements in such sections or in light
         of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and
         (C) agreeing to reimburse Lender, the Lender Group and the Underwriter
         Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by Lender
         and Lender Group in connection with investigating or defending the
         Liabilities; provided, however, that Borrower will be liable in any
         such case under clauses (B) or (C) above only to the extent that any
         such loss claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of any such
         untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in
         conformity with written information furnished to Lender by or on
         behalf of Borrower expressly for use in the Disclosure Document; and
         provided further, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any
         loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of
         any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
         omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
         information furnished to the Borrower by Lender, any member of the
         Lender Group or any member of the Underwriter Group expressly for use
         in the Disclosure Document. The foregoing indemnity with respect to
         any untrue statement contained in or omission from a preliminary
         private placement memorandum or preliminary prospectus shall not inure
         to the benefit of any member of the Underwriting Group (or any person
         controlling such member of the Underwriting Group) from whom the
         Person asserting any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense
         purchased any of the Securities which are the subject thereof if the
         Borrower shall sustain the burden of proving that any such loss,
         liability, claim, damage or expense resulted from the fact that such
         Person was not sent or given a copy of the final private placement
         memorandum or final prospectus at or prior to the written confirmation
         of the sale of such Security to such Person and the loss, liability,
         claim, damage or expense resulted from an untrue statement contained
         in or omission from such preliminary private placement memorandum or
         preliminary prospectus that was corrected in the final private
         placement memorandum or final prospectus.

                  (c)      In connection with filings under the Exchange Act,
         Borrower agrees to indemnify (i) Lender, the Lender Group and the
         Underwriter Group for Liabilities to which Lender, the Lender Group or
         the Underwriter Group may become subject insofar as the




                                     -72-

         Liabilities arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
         omission to state in the Provided Information or Required Records a
         material fact required to be stated in the Provided Information or
         Required Records in order to make the statements in the Provided
         Information or Required Records, in light of the circumstances under
         which they were made not misleading and (ii) reimburse Lender, the
         Lender Group or the Underwriter Group for any legal or other expenses
         reasonably incurred by Lender, the Lender Group or the Underwriter
         Group in connection with defending or investigating the Liabilities
         provided, however, that Borrower will be liable in any such case under
         clauses (i) or (ii) above only to the extent that any such loss claim,
         damage, liability or expense arises out of any such untrue statement
         or omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with
         written information furnished to Lender by or on behalf of Borrower
         expressly for use in the Disclosure Document; and provided further,
         that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability,
         claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue
         statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in
         reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
         the Borrower by Lender, any member of the Lender Group or any member
         of the Underwriter Group expressly for use in the Disclosure Document.

                  (d)      Lender Entity agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
         Borrower, each of its directors and each person who controls Borrower
         within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
         of the Exchange Act (the "Borrower Group") against any and all losses,
         claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such group
         may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, and will
         reimburse such group for any legal or other expenses reasonably
         incurred by such group in connection with investigating or defending
         any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, insofar as such
         losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
         arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
         statement of any material fact contained in a Disclosure Document or
         arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to
         state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
         necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
         circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but only to
         the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
         omission or alleged omission relates to information that does not
         accurately reflect Provided Information.

                  (e)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
         this Section 9.4 of notice of the commencement of any action, such
         indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
         against the indemnifying party under this Section 9.4, notify the
         indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the
         omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the
         indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may
         have to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that
         failure to notify causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the
         event that any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it
         notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
         indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with any other
         indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it
         (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified
         party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
         indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
         satisfactory to such indemnified party, provided that no compromise or
         settlement shall be entered without the consent of such indemnified
         party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. After notice
         from the indemnifying party to such




                                     -73-

         indemnified party under the immediately preceding sentence of this
         Section 9.4 and except as otherwise explicitly provided herein, the
         indemnifying party shall not be responsible for any legal or other
         expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection
         with the defense thereof; provided, however, if the defendants in any
         such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying
         party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that
         there are any legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
         parties that are different from or additional to those available to
         the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have
         the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and
         to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of
         such indemnified party or parties. The indemnifying party shall not be
         liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel unless an
         indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
         legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional
         to those available to another indemnified party. In no event shall an
         indemnifying party be liable to an indemnified party under this
         Section 9.4 for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which
         such indemnified party may become subject to the extent the same arise
         by reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
         misconduct of such indemnified party.

                  (f)      In order to provide for just and equitable
         contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement
         provided for in this Section 9.4 is for any reason held to be
         unenforceable by an indemnified party in respect of any losses,
         claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof) referred
         to therein which would otherwise be indemnifiable under Section 9.4,
         the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
         by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages
         or liabilities (or action in respect thereof); provided, however, that
         no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
         of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
         contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
         misrepresentation; and provided further, that Borrower will be liable
         under this Section 9.4 only to the extent that any such loss, claim,
         damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of any
         untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in
         conformity with written information furnished to Lender by Borrower
         expressly for use in the Disclosure Document or any failure to state
         any material fact known to Borrower and required to be stated in such
         written information in order to make such written information in light
         of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading. In
         determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties
         are entitled, the following factors shall be considered: (i) Lender
         Entity and Borrower's relative knowledge and access to information
         concerning the matter with respect to which claim was asserted; (ii)
         the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and
         (iii) any other equitable considerations appropriate in the
         circumstances. Lender Entity and Borrower hereby agree that it would
         not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by
         pro rata or per capita allocation.

                  (g)      The liabilities and obligations of both Borrower and
         Lender under this Section 9.4 shall survive the termination of the
         Security Instrument and the satisfaction and discharge of the
         Indebtedness for such period of time under any applicable statute of
         limitations that (i) any third party may bring any claim against
         Lender or Borrower, or (ii) Lender or Borrower may bring may bring any
         claim against each other, whether based on indemnification for a third
         party claim or otherwise.

                  Section 9.9       Savings Clause.

                  Section 9.13      Written Agreement.

                  (a)      THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER, EACH

         THE LENDER, THE BORROWER AND EACH BORROWER PRINCIPAL CONCERNING THE

                  (b)      THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS MAY
         NOT BE VARIED BY ANY ORAL AGREEMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS THAT OCCUR BEFORE,
         CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH, OR SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXECUTION OF THIS LOAN
         AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

                  (c)      THIS WRITTEN LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
         DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY
         NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR
         SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL

                  Section  9.14     Waiver of Jury Trial.


                  THE LENDER, THE BORROWER AND EACH BORROWER PRINCIPAL HEREBY
WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BASED UPON, OR RELATED TO, THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS LOAN AGREEMENT. THIS WAIVER IS KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY, AND
VOLUNTARILY MADE BY THE LENDER, THE BORROWER AND EACH BORROWER PRINCIPAL, AND
THE LENDER, THE BORROWER AND EACH BORROWER PRINCIPAL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO PERSON
ACTING ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PARTY TO THIS LOAN AGREEMENT HAS MADE ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OF FACT TO INDUCE THIS WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY OR IN ANY WAY TO
MODIFY OR NULLIFY ITS EFFECT. THE LENDER, THE BORROWER AND EACH BORROWER
PRINCIPAL FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED (OR HAVE HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO BE REPRESENTED) IN THE SIGNING OF THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND IN THE
MAKING OF THIS WAIVER BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, SELECTED OF THEIR OWN FREE

                  Section 9.15      Cross Default, Cross-Collateralization,
Waiver of Marshalling of Assets.

                  (a)      Borrower acknowledges that Lender has made the Loan
         to Borrower upon the security of its collective interest in the
         Individual Properties and in reliance upon the aggregate of the
         Individual Properties taken together being of greater value as
         collateral security than the sum of the Individual Properties taken
         separately. Borrower agrees that the Security Instruments are and will
         be cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with each other so that
         (i) an Event of Default under any of the Security Instrument shall
         constitute an Event of Default under each of the other Security
         Instrument which secure the Note; (ii) an Event of Default under the
         Note or this Loan Agreement shall constitute an Event of Default under
         each Security Instrument; and (iii) each Security Instrument shall
         constitute security for the Note as if a single blanket lien were
         placed on all of the Individual Properties as security for the Note.

                  (b)      In addition to the Loan, the Security Instrument
         shall also secure the following described additional loan (the
         "Additional Loan"), including without limitation, the indebtedness



                                     -77-
<PAGE>   83

         evidenced by such Promissory Notes (the "Additional Note") described
         below, and the payment and performance of all other indebtedness and
         obligations (including any additional advances) under the Additional
         Note and all agreements, instruments and other documents evidencing,
         securing or relating to the Additional Loan (each an "Additional Loan
         Document" and, collectively, the "Additional Loan Documents"),
         including without limitation, the loan agreement relating to the
         Additional Loan (the "Additional Loan Agreement", together with any
         and all amendments, renewals, replacements, extensions or other
         modifications to any of the foregoing:

                  Loan in the principal amount of $26,716,000 evidenced by a
                  Promissory Note executed by RFS SPE 2000 LLC and payable to
                  the Lender dated of even date herewith, in such principal
                  amount, secured by the following properties: Residence Inn,
                  Jacksonville, Florida; Residence Inn, Torrance, California;
                  Hampton Inn, Houston, Texas; and Hampton Inn, Jacksonville,
                  Florida.

                  The holder of any such Additional Note shall be entitled to
                  the benefits of the Security Instrument to the same extent as
                  the holder of the Note. Accordingly, all references in the
                  Security Instrument to the Loan, the Note, the Loan Agreement
                  or the Loan Documents shall be construed to include,
                  respectively, the Additional Loan, the Additional Note, the
                  Additional Loan Agreement and the Additional Loan Documents.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Loan
         Documents, the fact that the Security Instrument shall also secure the
         Additional Loan and the fact that the Borrower will enter into the
         Contribution Agreement shall not result in a default under any of the
         Loan Documents.

                  (c)      Any default or event of default under any Additional
         Loan Documents shall constitute an Event of Default under this Loan
         Agreement, the Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents,
         including without limitation, the Note. Any Event of Default hereunder
         or under any of the other Loan Documents shall constitute a default or
         event of default under the Additional Loan Documents, including
         without limitation, the Additional Note.

                  (d)      The Lender may, from time to time, at its election,
         release the Loan and/or the Additional Loan from the
         cross-collateralization and cross-default provisions set forth above.
         In the event the Loan is paid in full or the Loan is assumed in
         accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Lender may, in
         its sole and absolute discretion, at the request of the Borrower or
         any such assuming party, release the cross-collateralization and
         cross-default provisions set forth above, upon (i) Lender's approval,
         in its sole and absolute discretion, of the new Special Purpose Entity
         borrower, (ii) the affirmation of the Rating Agencies that such
         release will not result in a downgrade, qualification, or withdrawal
         in the ratings for any Securities, (iii) Borrower's providing of
         additional collateral in the form of Permitted Investments in an
         amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Allocated Loan Amount
         being released, (iv) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio Leases and Debt
         Service Coverage Ratio Premises on the remaining Individual Properties
         remaining equal to the greater of (A) such ratios at the Closing Date
         or (B) such ratios




                                     -78-
<PAGE>   84

         immediately prior to such release, and (iv) payment to the Lender of
         an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding
         principal balance of the Loan immediately preceding such payment of
         the Loan in full or on the date of such assumption (to be applied on a
         pro-rata basis against the Additional Loan in such manner as the
         Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion) and satisfaction
         of all other requirements of the Lender for such release. Any release
         of such cross-collateralization and cross-default provisions may be
         made by instruments executed solely by the Lender, without any need
         for joinder by the Borrower or any other Person. Upon the execution of
         any such release by the Lender, all other Loan Documents and
         Additional Loan Documents shall be deemed amended thereby so as to
         conform to such release. In no event shall any such release of the
         cross-collateralization and cross-default provisions be deemed or
         construed so as to release, satisfy or otherwise amend the Note, the
         Security Instrument or any of the other Loan Documents.

                  (e)      To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower,
         for itself and its successors and assigns, waives all rights to a
         marshalling of the assets of Borrower, Borrower's partners and others
         with interests in Borrower, and of the Individual Properties, or to a
         sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of foreclosure of all
         or any of the Security Instrument, and agrees not to assert any right
         under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in
         inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the administration
         of estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to defeat,
         reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a
         sale of the Individual Properties for the collection of the Loan
         without any prior or different resort for collection or of the right
         of Lender to the payment of the Loan out of the net proceeds of the
         Individual Properties in preference to every other claimant
         whatsoever. In addition, Borrower, for itself and its successors and
         assigns, waives in the event of foreclosure of any or all of the
         Security Instrument, any equitable right otherwise available to
         Borrower which would require the separate sale of the Individual
         Properties or require Lender to exhaust its remedies against any
         Individual Property or any combination of the Individual Properties
         before proceeding against any other Individual Property or combination
         of Individual Properties; and further in the event of such foreclosure
         Borrower does hereby expressly consents to and authorizes, at the
         option of Lender, the foreclosure and sale either separately or
         together of any combination of the Individual Properties.

                  Section 9.16      Servicer.

                  At the option of Lender, the Loan may be serviced by a
servicer (the "Servicer") selected by Lender and Lender may delegate all or any
portion of its responsibilities under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to the Servicer pursuant to a servicing agreement (the "Servicing
Agreement") between Lender and Servicer. Until Lender may elect otherwise, the
Servicer shall be Bank of America.

                              SPECIAL PROVISIONS

                  Section 10.1      Termination of Manager.

                  (a)      To the extent Borrower enters into any Management
         Agreement, such Management Agreement shall include provisions that if
         any of the following conditions occur during the term of the Loan: (a)
         at any time, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio Premises for the
         immediately preceding twelve (12) month period is less than 1.3x or
         (b) the amounts evidenced by the Note have been accelerated; or (c)
         the Manager shall become insolvent, the Borrower shall, at the request
         of Lender, terminate the Management Agreement and replace the Manager
         with a manager approved by Lender on terms and conditions satisfactory
         to Lender, it being understood and agreed that the management fee for
         such replacement manager shall not exceed then prevailing market
         rates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the reason for termination of
         the Manager is subsection (a) above, the Borrower may elect from time
         to time to provide additional collateral for a portion of the Loan
         such that, if the outstanding principal balance of the Loan were equal
         to such principal balance less the lower of (as determined by Lender)
         the face amount or fair market value of the additional collateral, the
         Debt Service Coverage Ratio Premises (after adjusting the Debt Service
         accordingly to reflect same) would equal or exceed 1.3x, in which case
         no termination would be effective. Any such additional collateral
         would not be released until Borrower has demonstrated a Debt Service
         Coverage Ratio Premises in excess of 1.3x without taking into account
         the additional collateral. All additional collateral must be U.S.
         Obligations and must be accompanied by such additional security
         agreements, financing statements and other documents or instruments,
         including opinions of Borrower's counsel, which in the reasonable
         opinion of Lender and its counsel would be necessary or advisable to
         create in Lender a first perfected security interest in the additional
         collateral. In addition and as a condition to the posting of such
         additional collateral, Lender shall have received written affirmation
         from the Rating Agencies that the credit ratings of the Securities
         immediately prior to such posting will not be qualified, downgraded or
         withdrawn as a result of such posting, which affirmation may be
         granted or withheld in the Rating Agencies' sole and absolute
         discretion.

                  (b)      If at any time during the term of the Loan, any
         Manager under any Management Agreement is an Affiliate of Borrower,
         Borrower shall have delivered a Non-Consolidation opinion, as
         acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion with respect to Manager
         and its equity owners.

                  Section 10.2      Substitution of Operating Lessee.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Lender may consent to the termination of the Operating Lease and substitution
of a new operating lease or if applicable a management agreement entered into
pursuant to the formation of the taxable REIT subsidiary (the "New Operating
Lease") in its sole discretion. Such consent shall not be required, provided
that Lender has received payment in full of any and all actual expenses
incurred in connection therewith and the following conditions have been

         of the REIT and Operating Partnership at the time the new Operating
         lease is executed;

                  (ii)     the terms of the New Operating Lease, including
         without limitation, economic provisions, are substantially similar or
         more preferential to Lender than the Operating Lease;

                  (iii)    the New Operating Lease contains a provision that
         if, at any time, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio Leases for the
         immediately preceding twelve (12) month period is less than 1.30x, the
         Borrower shall, at the request of Lender, terminate the New Operating
         Lease and replace the Operating Lessee or if applicable the New
         Manager with a new operating lessee or a new manager approved by
         Lender, on terms and conditions satisfactory to Lender;

                  (iv)     Lender has received no less than forty-five (45)
         days' prior written notice of such transfer;

                  (v)      if Qualified Operating Lessee is an Affiliate of
         Borrower: (x) Qualified Operating Lessee has fully subordinated all of
         its rights under the New Operating Lease to the Lien of the Security
         Instrument including but not limited to all provisions regarding
         insurance, condemnation and any purchase option exercisable by
         Qualified Operating Lessee; and (y) Borrower shall have delivered a
         Non-Consolidation Opinion, as acceptable to Lender in its sole
         discretion with respect to Qualified Operating Lessee and its equity
         owners;

                  (vi)     Lender shall have confirmations from any franchisors
         under any Franchise Agreements that such Franchise Agreements shall
         remain in full force and effect after the consummation of such New
         Operating Lease; and

                  (vii)    Lender shall have confirmations in writing from any
         applicable Rating Agencies to the effect that such new Operating Lease
         will not result in a re-qualification, reduction or withdrawal of any
         rating then assigned to any securities in a securitization.

         Beginning at the end of the first year of the Loan Term, Borrower
         shall make monthly deposits in an amount equal to the greater of (i)
         5% of Operating Income based on the Operating Statements provided by
         the Borrower, or (ii) $92,138.17 per month, the greater of (i) 5% of
         Operating Income based on the Operating Statements provided by the
         Borrower, or (ii) $94,441.67 per month beginning at the end of the
         second year of the Loan Term, the greater of (i) 5% of Operating
         Income based on the Operating Statements provided by the Borrower, or
         (ii) $96,802.67 per month beginning at the end of the third year of
         the Loan Term, the greater of (i) 5% of Operating Income based on the
         Operating Statements provided by the Borrower, or (ii) $99,222.75 per
         month beginning at the end of the fourth year of the Loan Term, the
         greater of (i) 5% of Operating Income based on the Operating
         Statements provided by the Borrower, or (ii) $101,703.33 per month
         beginning at the end of the fifth year of the Loan Term, the greater
         of (i) 5% of Operating Income based on the Operating Statements
         provided by the Borrower, or (ii) $104,245.91 per month beginning at
         the end of the sixth year of the Loan Term, the greater of (i) 5% of
         Operating Income based on the Operating Statements provided by the
         Borrower, or (ii) $106,852.08 per month beginning at the end of the

         "Monthly Deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account"). The Lender may,
         in its reasonable discretion, adjust such monthly amount from time to
         time to an amount sufficient, in the Lender's reasonable judgment, to
         maintain adequate balances necessary for repair and/or replacement
         costs as they may arise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
         the Lender shall at any time increase the Monthly Deposit to the
         Replacement Reserve Account over the monthly amount then required, the
         Borrower may, at its election, request that the Lender obtain, at the
         sole cost, fee and expense of the Borrower, an engineer's report from
         an engineer to be selected by the Lender in its reasonable discretion,
         in which case the Monthly Deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account
         shall be adjusted by the Lender based on such engineer's report,
         provided that in no event shall the Monthly Deposit to the Replacement
         Reserve Account be decreased below the amount then required.

         Monthly Reserve Deposits to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account
         shall be in an amount equal to (a) the sum of (i) the aggregate
         anticipated annual premiums for all insurance policies required to be
         maintained pursuant to this Loan Agreement due in the coming year,
         (ii) the sum of the anticipated annual real property taxes, personal
         property taxes, intangibles taxes and assessment for the Premises due
         in the coming year, (iii) the sum of anticipated annual water and
         sewer assessments and frontage charges for the Premises due in the
         coming year, and (iv) the sum of all other anticipated assessments and
         charges against the Premises due in the coming year, divided by (b)
         twelve (12).

                  3.       In connection with the credit being extended
pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Lender has requested the
Lessee and the Borrower to execute this Agreement, and in order to induce the

set out herein.


                                   AGREEMENT

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                  FIRST: Each Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the
Security Instruments and to all renewals, modifications or extensions thereof.

                  SECOND: With respect to each Lease, so long as Lessee is not
in default (beyond any period in such Lease given Lessee to cure such default)
in the payment of rent (specifically including but not limited to percentage
rent and base rent of every kind and character) or additional rent or in the
performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Lease on
Lessee's part to be performed, and except as expressly set forth herein,
Lessee's possession of the premises described in the Lease and Lessee's rights
and privileges under the Lease, or any extensions or renewals thereof which may
be effected in accordance with any option therefor in the Lease, shall not be
disturbed, diminished or interfered with by any suit, action or proceeding upon
any Security Instrument or the obligations secured thereby, or the foreclosure
of the Security Instruments or the enforcement of any rights thereunder or
under any other Loan Document or otherwise by Lender.

                  THIRD: If the interests of Borrower shall be transferred to
and owned by Lender by reason of foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or
other proceedings brought by it or by any other manner, and Lender succeeds to
the interest of the Borrower under any Lease, Lessee shall be bound to Lender
under all of the terms, covenants and conditions of such Lease for the balance
of the term thereof remaining and any extensions or renewals thereof which may
be effected in accordance with any option thereof in such Lease, with the same
force and effect as if Lender were the lessor under the Lease, and Lessee does
hereby attorn to Lender as its lessor, said attornment to be effective and
self-operative without the execution of any further instruments on the part of
either of the parties hereto immediately upon Lender succeeding to the interest
of the lessor under such Lease. The respective rights and obligations of Lessee
and Lender upon said attornment, to the extent of the then remaining balance of
the term of such Lease and any such extensions and renewals, shall be and are
the same as now set forth therein, subject to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement; it being the intention of the parties hereto for this purpose to
incorporate the Leases in this Agreement by reference with the same force and
effect as if set forth at length herein, subject to the terms and provisions of
this Agreement.

                  FOURTH: Lessee certifies that: (a) each Lease is presently in
full force and effect; (b) no rent under any Lease has been paid more than
thirty (30) days in advance of its due date, other than any overpayments of
percentage rent that may be adjusted as provided in such Lease; (c) Lessee has
not filed any claim of offset and, to the best knowledge of Lessee, Lessee,




                                       2
<PAGE>   101

as of this date, has no charge, lien or claim of offset under any Lease, or
otherwise, against the rents or other amounts due or to become due thereunder;
(d) the Lessee is owner of the "Tenant's" or "Lessee's" interest in the Lease
and has not transferred or assigned any Lease or sublet the premises demised
thereby; and (e) to the best knowledge of the Lessee, neither the Lessee nor
the Lessor is in any way in default under any Lease and Lessee, to the best of
its knowledge, knows of no event which but for the passage of time or the
giving of notice or both would constitute an event of default or breach by
Lessee or Borrower under any Lease. Lessee shall up to twice a calendar year
(and at such additional times as Lender shall reasonably request), within ten
(10) days after request by Lender, execute, acknowledge and deliver a statement
by Lessee certifying the items listed in subsections (a)-(e) above with such
exceptions as shall be necessary to cause such statement to be factually
correct.

                  FIFTH:  If Lender  shall  succeed to the  interest of Borrower
under any Lease, Lender shall be bound to Lessee under all terms,  covenants and
conditions of such Lease, and Lessee shall,  from and after Lender's  succession
to the interest of Borrower  under such Lease,  have the same  remedies  against
Lender for the breach of an  agreement  contained in the Lease that Lessee might
have had under such Lease  against  Borrower if Lender had not  succeeded to the
interest of Borrower;  provided further,  however, that Lender shall not be:

                  (a)      liable for any act or omission of any prior landlord
         (including the Borrower) except that Lender shall be liable for such
         act or omission only from and after the date on which Lender so
         succeeds to the interest of Borrower under such Lease if such act or
         omission constitutes a default of Borrower under such Lease and
         continues to exist after such date; or

                  (b)      subject to any offsets or defenses which the Lessee
         might have against any prior landlord (including the Borrower) except
         for offsets expressly provided for in such Lease arising from Lessor
         defaults under such Lease with respect to which Lessee has notified
         Lender pursuant to clause SEVENTH hereof (such notice to set forth a
         quantification of the potential offset amount to the extent possible);
         or

                  (c)      liable for the return of any security deposits not
         delivered to Lender; or

                  (d)      bound by any rent or additional rent which Lessee
         might have paid for more than thirty (30) days in advance of its due
         date to any prior landlord (including Borrower), other than any
         overpayments of percentage rent that may be adjusted as provided in
         the Lease; or

                  (e)      bound by any amendment or modification of the Lease
         including, but not limited to, any reduction in rent, made without
         Lender's consent; or

                  (f)      obligated to construct or finish the construction or
         to renovate or finish the renovation of the premises described in any
         Lease, except as required under such Lease.

                  SIXTH: Each Lease now is, and shall at all times continue to
be, subject and subordinate in each and every respect, to the Security
Instruments and to any and all renewals, modifications and extensions thereof,
but any and all such renewals, modifications and extensions shall nevertheless
be subject to and entitled to the benefits of the terms of this




                                       3
<PAGE>   102

Agreement. Lessee acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any conflict
between the provisions of any Lease and the provisions of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall control.

                  SEVENTH: Lessee will notify Lender or its successors or
assigns, by reputable overnight courier delivery, of any default of Borrower
which would entitle Lessee to cancel any Lease or abate the rent payable
thereunder, and agrees that notwithstanding any provision of such Lease, no
notice of cancellation thereof, nor any abatement shall be effective unless
Lender has received the notice aforesaid and has failed within thirty (30) days
of the date thereof to cure such default or, if the default cannot be cured
within thirty (30) days, has failed to commence and to diligently prosecute the
cure of Borrower's default which gave rise to such right of cancellation or
abatement. The address of the Lender for notice is Bank of America, N.A., CMLS
#1777, P.O. Box 3609, Los Angeles, California 90051, Attn: Servicing Manager.
Lender will notify Lessee or its successors or assigns in writing of any
default of Borrower under the Loan Documents that would entitle Lender to
enforce its rights or remedies thereunder, and agrees that it will not enforce
its rights or remedies thereunder unless Lessee has received a written notice
for a time period equivalent to the time period afforded to Borrower under the
Loan Documents and Lessee has failed to cure such default within such
time-period. The address of the Lessee for notice is RFS, Inc., c/o Promus
Hotel Corporation, 755 Crossover Lane, Memphis, Tennessee 38117-4900, Attn:
Peter Kesser.

                  EIGHTH: No Lease may be assigned or sublet by the Lessee
without the Lender's prior written consent, except as the Lessee may be
permitted to do so without the consent of the Borrower under the terms of such
Lease. A franchisor of any hotel owned by the Borrower on the premises demised
under any Lease may not be replaced by the Lessee without the Lender's prior
written consent. Lessee hereby consents and agrees to the lien of the Security
Instruments and the other Loan Documents for each of the Properties, including
any subsequent transfers or assignments thereof made by the Lender and the
financing of a direct purchaser from Lender, provided that such financing is
substantially similar to the Loan in all material respects including, but not
limited to, its financial terms, loan to value ratio and its effect on Lessee.

                  NINTH: Lessee acknowledges that all of the interest of
Borrower in and to the Leases has been assigned to Lender pursuant to the
Security Instruments and that pursuant to the terms of that certain Cash
Management Agreement of even date herewith between Lender and Borrower (the
"Cash Management Agreement"), all rent and other payments due under the Lease
shall be deposited in an account (the "Account") established in accordance with
the provisions contained in the Cash Management Agreement. Lessee hereby
agrees, without further notice, to so pay all such rent and other payments
under the Lease directly to the Account as and when same are due and payable
under the Lease. Lessee further acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement
shall serve as notice required pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Lease. Borrower
hereby authorizes Lessee to pay all rent and other payments to Lender and
acknowledges that all rent and other payments so paid to Lender shall be deemed
paid under the Lease.

                  TENTH: This Agreement may not be modified except by an
agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto.

                  ELEVENTH: Lessee hereby agrees not to exercise its rights
under Section 34.3 of any Lease with respect to any Property against Borrower,
Lender or any direct successor of Lender prior to the earlier of (i) the
payment in full, prepayment or defeasance of the Loan as to the Property, or
(ii) transfer of the Property to Lender or a third-party through foreclosure,
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or otherwise.

                  TWELFTH: In no event shall Lender or any direct successor or
assignee of Lender (collectively, the "Subsequent Landlord") have any personal
liability for the obligations of Borrower under any Lease and should the
Subsequent Landlord succeed to the interests of the Borrower under such Lease,
Lessee shall look only to the estate and property of any such Subsequent
Landlord in the related Property for the satisfaction of Lessee's remedies for
the collection of a judgment (or other judicial process) requiring the payment
of money in the event of any default by any Subsequent Landlord as landlord
under the Lease, and no other property or assets of any Subsequent Landlord
shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedure for the
satisfaction of Lessee's remedies under or with respect to the Lease; provided,
however, that the Lessee may exercise any other right or remedy provided
thereby or by law in the event of any failure by Subsequent Landlord to perform
any such obligation.

                  THIRTEENTH: [Sections 15.3, 15.4 and 15.5 of each of the
Leases shall be amended so that any Award with respect to the Property shall be
subject and subordinate to the Lender's prior claim to one hundred twenty-five
percent (125%) of the amount set forth on Schedule 3 for such Property, as
reduced by any amortization, prepayment or defeasance amount on the Loan
applicable to such Property. Lessee acknowledges that Lessee has no claim to
any insurance proceeds payable to Lender or Lessor with respect to any Property
in the event of any loss or damage to the Property, or any portion thereof,
insured under the policies of insurance required by Article XIII of the
Leases.]

                  FOURTEENTH: As to each Lease, the law of the state in which
the applicable Property subject to such Lease is located shall govern the
interpretation of this Agreement.

                  FIFTEENTH Borrower represents and warrants that the
Assignment of Leases was duly executed by Borrower and all consents,
resolutions or other approvals required for Borrower to execute the Assignment
of Leases were obtained. Lessee represents and warrants that the Leases were
duly executed by Lessee and all consents, resolutions or other approvals
required for Lessee to execute the Leases were obtained.

                  SIXTEENTH: Lessee represents and warrants that it has made no
assignment of Lessee's rights or interest pursuant to any portion of the Lease
including without limitation Section 4(b) of the Master Agreement dated as of
_______________________.

                  SEVENTEENTH: Lender hereby consents to the amendment of the
Lease terms as set forth in the Amendment. Lessee hereby consents to the
assignment of the interest of RFS, L.P. under the Lease to Borrower pursuant to
the Assignment of Leases.

together shall constitute and be construed as one and the same instrument.

                  NINETEENTH: All remedies which Lender may have against
Borrower provided herein, if any, are cumulative and shall be in addition to
any and all other rights and remedies provided by law and by other agreements
between Lender and Borrower or others. If any party consists of multiple
individuals or entities, each of same shall be jointly and severally liable for
the obligations of such party hereunder.

the matters described herein.

                  TWENTY-FIRST: This Agreement shall apply to all properties

of the Loan Documents shall thereafter be released from the terms of this
Agreement.

                  TWENTY-SECOND: The terms of this Agreement shall expire and
be of no further effect, except to the extent of any then existing unsatisfied
obligations arising under this Agreement as to a Lease for a property upon the
earlier of: (i) a release by Lender of the property as security for the Loan,

            SUBORDINATION, NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT

                  THIS SUBORDINATION, NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT
(the "Agreement") is made as of the ___ day of _____________, 2000 by and
between BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., a national banking association, having an
address at 100 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28255 successors
and assigns ("Lender") and ___________________________________________________
having an address at
____________________________________________________________________("Tenant").


                                   RECITALS:

                  A.       Lender is the present owner and holder of a certain
deed of trust and security agreement (the "Security Instrument") dated
___________, 2000, given by Landlord (defined below) to Lender which encumbers
the fee estate of Landlord in certain premises described in Exhibit A attached
hereto known as the _____________________ (the "Property") and which secures
the payment of certain indebtedness owed by Landlord to Lender evidenced by a
certain promissory note dated ____________, 2000, given by Landlord to Lender
(the "Note);

                  B.       Tenant is the holder of a leasehold estate in a
portion of the Property under and pursuant to the provisions of a certain lease
dated ________________, ____ between ______________, as landlord ("Landlord")
and Tenant, as tenant (the "Lease"); and

                  C.       Tenant has agreed to subordinate the Lease to the
Security Instrument and the lien thereof and Lender has agreed to grant
non-disturbance to Tenant under the Lease on the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth.


                                   AGREEMENT:

                  For good and valuable consideration, Tenant and Lender agree
as follows:

                  1.       Subordination. The Lease and all of the terms,
covenants and provisions thereof and all rights, remedies and options of Tenant
thereunder are and shall at all times continue to be subject and subordinate in
all respects to the terms, covenants and provisions of the Security Instrument
and to the lien thereof, including without limitation, all renewals, increases,
modifications, spreaders, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof
and to all sums secured thereby and advances made thereunder with the same
force and effect as if the Security Instrument had been executed, delivered and
recorded prior to the execution and the delivery of the Lease.

                  2.       Non-Disturbance. If any action or proceeding is
commenced by Lender for the foreclosure of the Security Instrument or the sale
of the Property, Tenant shall not be named as a party therein unless such
joinder shall be required by law, provided, however, such joinder shall not
result in the termination of the Lease or disturb the Tenant's possession or
use of the premises thereunder, and the sale of the Property in any such action
or proceeding and the exercise by Lender of any of its other rights under the
Note or the Security Instrument shall be made subject to all rights of Tenant
under the Lease, provided that at the time of the




                                       1
<PAGE>   112

commencement of any such action or proceeding or at the time of any such sale
or exercise of any such other rights, Tenant shall not be in default beyond any
applicable cure period under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the
Lease or of this Agreement on Tenant's part to be observed or performed.

                  3.       Attornment. If Lender or any other subsequent
purchaser of the Property shall become the owner of the Property by reason of
the foreclosure of the Security Instrument or the acceptance of a deed or
assignment in lieu of foreclosure or by reason of any other enforcement of the
Security Instrument (Lender or such other purchaser being hereinafter referred
as "Purchaser"), and the conditions set forth in Section 2 above have been met
at the time Purchaser becomes owner of the Property, the Lease shall not be
terminated or affected thereby but shall continue in full force and effect as a
direct Lease between Purchaser and Tenant upon all of the terms, covenants and
conditions set forth in the Lease and in that event, Tenant agrees to attorn to
Purchaser and Purchaser by virtue of such acquisition of the Property shall be
deemed to have agreed to accept such attornment, provided, however, that
Purchaser shall not be (a) liable for the failure of any prior landlord (any
such prior landlord, including Landlord and any successor landlord, being
hereinafter referred to as a "Prior Landlord") to perform any of its
obligations under the Lease except that Lender shall be liable for such failure
only from and after the date on which Lender so succeeds to the interest of
such Prior Landlord, provided that the foregoing shall not limit Purchaser's
obligations under the Lease to correct any conditions that (i) existed as of
the date Purchaser shall become the owner of the Property and (ii) violate
Purchaser's obligations as landlord under the Lease; provided further however,
that Purchaser shall have received written notice of such omissions, conditions
or violations and has had a reasonable opportunity to cure the same, all
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Lease, (b) subject to any offsets,
defenses, abatements or counterclaims which shall have accrued in favor of
Tenant against any Prior Landlord prior to the date upon which Purchaser shall
become the owner of the Property except for offsets expressly provided for in
the Lease arising from Landlord defaults under the Lease with respect to which
Tenant has notified Purchaser (such notice to set forth a quantification of the
potential offset amount to the extent possible), (c) liable for the return of
rental security deposits, if any, paid by Tenant to any Prior Landlord in
accordance with the Lease unless such sums are actually received by Purchaser,
or (d) bound by any payment of rents, additional rents or other sums which
Tenant may have paid more than one (1) month in advance to any Prior Landlord
unless (i) such sums are actually received by Purchaser or (ii) such prepayment
shall have been expressly approved of by Purchaser. In the event that any
liability of Purchaser does arise pursuant to this Agreement, such liability
shall be limited and restricted to Purchaser's interest in the Property and
shall in no event exceed such interest.

                  4.       Notice to Tenant. After notice is given to Tenant by
Lender that the Landlord is in default under the Note and the Security
Instrument and that the rentals under the Lease should be paid to Lender
pursuant to the terms of the assignment of leases and rents executed and
delivered by Landlord to Lender in connection therewith, Tenant shall
thereafter pay to Lender or as directed by the Lender, all rentals and all
other monies due or to become due to Landlord under the Lease and Landlord

                  Section  1.2. So long as the Indemnitor owns or is in
possession of the Premises, the Indemnitor shall:

                  (a)      Not cause, permit or exacerbate any Prohibited
         Activities or Conditions (as defined below). The Indemnitor represents
         and warrants that it has not at any time caused or permitted any
         Prohibited Activities or Conditions except as set forth in the
         Environmental Assessment (as defined below) and that, except as noted
         in the Environmental Report, no Prohibited Activities or Conditions
         exist or have existed on or under the Premises. The Indemnitor shall
         take all appropriate steps to prevent its employees, agents, and
         contractors, and any tenants from causing, permitting, or exacerbating
         any Prohibited Activities or Conditions. The Indemnitor shall not
         lease or allow the sublease or use of all or any portion of the
         Premises to any tenant, subtenant or user that, in the ordinary course
         of its business, would cause, permit, or exacerbate any Prohibited
         Activities or Conditions, and all leases, subleases and use agreements
         relating to the Premises shall contain provisions sufficient to ensure
         that tenants, subtenants and users shall not cause, permit or
         exacerbate any Prohibited Activities or Conditions.

                  (b)      Comply in a timely manner with, and cause all
         employees, agents, and contractors or the Indemnitor and any other
         persons present on the Premises to so comply with, (i) any O&M Program
         (as defined below) now or hereafter in effect during the term of the
         Loan, and (ii) Hazardous Materials Law, so as to minimize any economic
         loss to the Premises and the Loan. The Indemnitor shall adopt an O&M
         Program with respect to any Hazardous Materials identified in any
         Environmental Assessment or any Governmental Action (as defined below)
         relating to the Premises, or as otherwise required by the Lender with
         respect to the Premises. Any O&M Program shall be performed by
         qualified contractors under the supervision of a consulting engineer
         hired by the Indemnitor with the prior written approval of the Lender
         which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
         delayed. All costs and expenses of any O&M Program shall be paid by
         the Indemnitor, including without limitation the charges of such
         contractors and consulting engineer and the Lender's fees, costs and
         expenses incurred in




                                       3
<PAGE>   121

         connection with the monitoring and review of the O&M Program and the
         Indemnitor's performance thereunder.

                  (c)      Promptly notify the Lender in writing of: (i) any
         Governmental Action it becomes aware of (ii) any claim made or
         threatened by any third party against the Indemnitor, the Lender, or
         the Premises relating to loss or injury resulting from any occurrence
         or condition on the Premises or any other real property that could
         require the removal from the Premises of any Hazardous Materials or
         cause any restrictions on the ownership, occupancy, transferability or
         use of the Premises under Hazardous Materials Law or (iii) the
         occurrence of any Prohibited Activities or Conditions. The Indemnitor
         shall cooperate with any governmental inquiry, and shall comply with
         any governmental or judicial order, request or directive which arises
         from any alleged Prohibited Activities or Conditions; provided that
         with respect to governmental requests or directives only, the
         Indemnitor may contest or object to a good faith dispute regarding
         said request or directive if the Indemnitor notifies the Lender in
         advance of said contest or objection and as long as said contest or
         objection does not result in a violation of law or fines assessed
         against the Premises.

                  (d)      Pay promptly or cause to be paid all costs and
         expenses incurred by the Lender in connection with any Governmental
         Action, including but not limited to costs of any environmental
         audits, studies, investigations or remedial activities including but
         not limited to the removal of any Hazardous Materials from the
         Premises. The Borrower also shall pay promptly or cause to be paid the
         costs of any environmental audits, studies, investigations or the
         removal of any Hazardous Materials from the Premises required by the
         Lender as a condition of its consent to any sale or transfer of all or
         any part of the Premises or any interest therein or required by the
         Lender following a reasonable determination by the Lender that there
         may be Prohibited Activities or Conditions on or under the Premises.
         Any such costs or expenses incurred by the Lender (including but not
         limited to reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and consultants,
         whether incurred in connection with any judicial or administrative
         process or otherwise) which the Borrower fails to pay promptly shall
         become additional indebtedness secured by the Security Instrument.

                  Section  1.3.     Upon the Lender's reasonable request, at any
time after a prohibited activity occurs and from time to time while the
Security Instrument is in effect, the Indemnitor shall provide at the
Indemnitor's sole expense, an inspection or audit of the Premises prepared by a
licensed hydrogeologist or licensed environmental engineer approved by the
Lender indicating the presence or absence of Hazardous Materials on the
Premises. If the Indemnitor fails to provide such inspection or audit within
thirty (30) days after such request the Lender may order same, and the
Indemnitor hereby grants to the Lender and their employees and agents access to
the Premises and a license to undertake such inspection or audit. The cost of
such inspection or audit shall be added to the principal balance of the sums
due under the Note (as defined in the Security Instrument) and the Security
Instrument and shall bear interest thereafter until paid at the default rate
thereunder.

                  Section  1.4.     The Indemnitor represents and warrants that,
except as noted in the Environmental Report to the best of the Indemnitor's
knowledge, after due inquiry and investigation, no asbestos or any substance
containing asbestos ("Asbestos") is located on the




                                       4
<PAGE>   122

Premises except as may have been disclosed in an environmental report delivered
to the Lender prior to the date of this Agreement. The Indemnitor shall not
install in the Premises, nor permit to be installed in the Premises, Asbestos
and shall remove or cause to be removed any Asbestos promptly upon discovery to
the satisfaction of the Lender, or take all action necessary to ensure that
such Asbestos is abated or managed in a manner which complies with all
applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations
with respect to Asbestos. The Indemnitor shall in all instances comply with,
and ensure compliance by all occupants of the Premises with, all applicable
federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations with respect
to Asbestos, and shall keep the Premises free and clear of any liens imposed
pursuant to such laws, ordinances, rules or regulations. In the event that the
Indemnitor receives any notice or advice from any governmental agency or any
source whatsoever with respect to Asbestos on, affecting or installed on the
Premises, the Indemnitor shall immediately notify the Lender. Upon the Lender's
reasonable request, at any time and from time to time while the Security
Instrument is in effect, the Indemnitor shall provide, at the Indemnitor's sole
expense, an inspection or audit of the Premises prepared by an engineering or
consulting firm approved by the Lender, indicating the presence or absence of
Asbestos on the Premises. If the Indemnitor fails to provide such inspection or
audit within thirty (30) days after such request, the Lender may order same,
and the Indemnitor hereby grants to the Lender and its employees and agents
access to the Premises and a license to undertake such inspection or audit. The
cost of such inspection or audit shall be added to the principal balance of the
sums due under the Note and the Security Instrument and shall bear interest
thereafter until paid at the default rate thereunder.

                  Section 1.5.          In the event that any investigation,
site monitoring, containment cleanup, removal, restoration or other work of any
kind is reasonably necessary or desirable under an applicable Hazardous
Material Law (the "Remedial Work"), the Indemnitor shall commence or cause to
be commenced and thereafter diligently prosecute to completion all such
Remedial Work within thirty (30) days after written demand by the Lender for
performance thereof (or such shorter period of time as may be required under
applicable law). All Remedial Work shall be performed by contractors approved
in advance by the Lender, and under the supervision of a consulting engineer
approved by the Lender. All costs and expenses of such Remedial Work shall be
paid by the Indemnitor including, without limitation, the Lender's reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in connection with monitoring or
review of such Remedial Work. In the event the Indemnitor shall fail to timely
commence, or cause to be commenced, or fail to diligently prosecute to
completion, or pay for, such Remedial Work, the Lender may, but shall not be
required to, cause such Remedial Work to be performed or paid for, and all
costs and expenses thereof, or incurred in connection therewith, may be added
to the sums due under the Note and the Security Instrument and shall bear
interest thereafter until paid at the default rate thereunder.

                  Section 1.6.      THE INDEMNITOR SHALL HOLD HARMLESS, DEFEND
AND INDEMNIFY THE LENDER AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, TRUSTEES, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS, AFFILIATES (INCLUDING ANY PARENT CORPORATION), SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS,
FROM AND AGAINST ALL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, FEES, COSTS AND

schedule, certificate, or other document furnished by the Indemnitor to the
Lender in connection with this Agreement contains any misstatement of fact or
omits to state any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading.

                  Section 1.8.      The obligations and liabilities of the
Indemnitor to the Lender under this Article I shall survive any termination,
satisfaction, or assignment of the Security Instrument, including, without
limitation, any sale of the Loan and the exercise by the Lender of any of its
rights or remedies hereunder, including but not limited to, the acquisition of

<PAGE>   125

any of the agreements, covenants, terms or conditions contained in any of the
Loan Documents by operation of law or otherwise (whether such amendments,
modifications, extensions or releases are made with or without notice to the
undersigned); (b) by the fact that the Indemnitor may or may not be personally
liable, in whole or in part, under the terms of the Loan Documents; (c) by the
failure to give the Indemnitor any notices of default under the Loan Documents
or otherwise; (d) by any other indemnity or guaranty now or hereafter executed
in connection with the Loan; (e) by any rights, powers or privileges the Lender
may now or hereafter have against any person, entity or collateral or (f) by
reason of any bankruptcy or similar proceeding instituted by or against the
Indemnitor. The Indemnitor will not take or fail to take action of any kind the
taking of which or the failure to take which might be the basis for a claim
that the Indemnitor has any defense to the Indemnitor's obligations hereunder.
The Indemnitor waives any right or claim of right to cause a marshaling of the
Indemnitor's assets or to cause the Lender to proceed against the Indemnitor
under the Security Instrument or under any other Loan Document, and/or any
collateral held by the Lender at any time or in any particular order and the
Indemnitor agrees that any payments required to be made by the Indemnitor
hereunder shall become due on demand in accordance with the terms hereof and
the Indemnitor expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and remedies
accorded by applicable law to the Indemnitors, including, without limitation,
any extension of time conferred by any law now or hereafter in effect and any
requirement of notice to which the Indemnitor may now or hereafter be entitled.
The Indemnitor waives (i) notice of acceptance of this Agreement by the Lender
and any and all notices and demands of every kind which may be required to be
given by any statute, rule or law, (ii) any defense, right of set-off or other
claim which the Indemnitor may have against the Lender or the holder of the
Security Instrument, (iii) any failure by the Lender to inform the Indemnitor
of any facts the Lender may now or hereafter know about the Indemnitor, the
Premises, the Loan or the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, it
being understood and agreed that the Lender has no duty so to inform, and (iv)
all rights of redemption, homestead, dower, and other rights or exemptions of
every kind, whether under common law or by statute.

                  Section 2.2.      No delay on the Lender's part in exercising
any right, power or privilege under any of the Loan Documents, this Agreement
or any other document executed by the Indemnitor in connection with the Loan
shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power or privilege.

                  Section 2.3.      The Lender shall have the right to join the
Indemnitor in any action or proceeding commenced by the Lender pursuant to the
rights, powers and privileges the Lender now or hereafter may possess under
this Agreement or, at the Lender's option, the Lender may commence any action
or proceeding based upon this Agreement directly against the Indemnitor without
making the Indemnitor under the Security Instrument or under any other Loan
Document or anyone else a party defendant in such action or proceeding. In the
event any action or proceeding arising on, under, out of or by reason of or
relating in any way to this Agreement or the interpretation, breach or
enforcement thereof is brought against the Indemnitor, service of process may
be made on the Indemnitor by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the
address set forth below or such other address as the Lender is notified of by
notice sent in accordance herewith.

hands of an attorney for collection of any payment due hereunder or is
collected through any legal proceeding; (ii) an attorney is retained to
represent the Lender in any bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or other
proceedings affecting creditors' rights and involving a claim under this
Agreement; or (iii) an attorney is retained to represent the Lender in any
other proceedings whatsoever in connection with this Agreement or to provide
advice or other representation with respect to this Agreement, then the
Indemnitor shall pay expenses, including, without limitation, court costs,
filing fees, recording costs, and all other costs and expenses reasonably
incurred in connection therewith, in addition to all other amounts due
hereunder, regardless of whether all or a portion of such enforcement costs are
in a single proceeding brought to enforce this Agreement as well as the other
Loan Documents.

representations, agreements and understandings heretofore had between the
Lender and the Indemnitor with respect thereto are merged herein.

INTERPRETATION, BREACH OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Lender's benefit and to the benefit of the Lender's successors and assigns and

benefit of anyone claiming title to the collateral sold by the Lender pursuant
to the Lender's rights, powers and privileges under the Loan Documents.

                  Section 2.8.      THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA WITHOUT
REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF. THE INDEMNITOR HEREBY SUBMITS TO
PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN SAID STATE AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA (AND ANY APPELLATE COURTS TAKING APPEALS THEREFROM) LOCATED IN SAID
STATE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE INDEMNITOR'S OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER AND WAIVES
ANY AND ALL PERSONAL RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW OF ANY OTHER STATE TO OBJECT TO
JURISDICTION WITHIN SUCH STATE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING
OR LITIGATION TO ENFORCE SUCH OBLIGATIONS OF THE INDEMNITOR. THE INDEMNITOR
HEREBY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN ANY ACTION, SUIT,
PROCEEDING OR LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, (A) THAT
IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH JURISDICTION OR THAT SUCH ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR
LITIGATION MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN THOSE COURTS OR THAT
THIS AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY THOSE COURTS OR THAT THE INDEMNITOR
IS EXEMPT OR IMMUNE FROM




                                       9
