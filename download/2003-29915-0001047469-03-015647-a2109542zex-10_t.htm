<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Introduction  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan ("Plan") provides coverage to eligible Retired Salaried Employees and eligible Retired Hourly Employees
through a group term life insurance policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). No Retiree contributions are required. </FONT></P>

pays the benefits under the Plan. In addition, MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as to whether a Claim for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Eligibility  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are eligible if you are a Retiree who, on the day preceding your Retirement, was covered under The Dow Chemical Company Group Life Insurance Program's
Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan that was available to active Salaried Employees and Certain Bargained for Employees; provided that with respect to Retired Bargained-For
Employees, the applicable bargaining agreement provides that you are eligible for coverage under this Plan. (Note that UCC retirees are not "Retirees" under the definition of "Retiree" in the Plan
because they are not participants of DEPP). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you do not meet the above eligibility criteria, check the Plan Document for additional eligible retiree populations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are a former Salaried Employee receiving a Disability Retirement Benefit from the Dow Employees' Pension Plan ("DEPP"), as defined under DEPP, and you were covered under The Dow
Chemical Company Employee Paid Life Insurance Plan coverage on the day preceding your Retirement, you are also eligible for coverage. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are a former Texas Operations Hourly Employee receiving a Disability Retirement Benefit from the Dow Employees' Pension Plan ("DEPP"), as defined under DEPP, and you were covered
under the Texas Operations Hourly Contributory Optional Life Insurance Plan coverage on the day preceding your Retirement, you are also eligible for coverage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are covered under The Dow Chemical Company Group Life Insurance Program's Union Carbide Subsidiary Basic Life Insurance Plan, you are not eligible for coverage under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan Administrator determines eligibility. The Plan Administrator is a fiduciary to the Plan and has the full discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings
of fact. Interpretations and eligibility determination by the Plan Administrator are final and binding on Participants. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you want to file&nbsp;a Claim for a Determination of Eligibility because you are not sure whether you are eligible to participate in the Plan or have been told that you are not, see
the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claims Procedures Appendix</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of this SPD. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Enrollment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Retirement, you may complete an enrollment card, with coverage effective immediately. If you want to be covered under Plan I at age 65, you must complete an
enrollment form and return it to the Dow Benefits Center </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><U>within 31&nbsp;days</U></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of your Retirement. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B><U>Failure to return the form within 31&nbsp;days of your Retirement will
result in automatic enrollment in Plan II at age
65</U></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>Note:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> At a later date, you may decrease your coverage option by switching from Plan I to Plan II; however, you will not be permitted to
upgrade your coverage by switching from Plan II to Plan I, even with proof of insurability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until you reach age 65, you will be provided with coverage equal to one times (1x) your base annual salary at time of Retirement, rounded up to the next $1000,

SIZE=2><B>Plan I:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Beginning on the first of the month following your 65th birthday, your life insurance will equal 1x your base annual salary,
rounded up to the next $1,000. At age 66, your coverage amount is reduced 20&nbsp;percent (of the original amount) each year until age 68. At age 68 and beyond, your coverage
amount is equal to one-half your base annual salary at time of Retirement, with minimum coverage of $10,000. The following chart summarizes the insurance coverage for Retirees electing

<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cost of your Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance in excess of $50,000 is based on a Uniform Premium Table established by the federal government. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Naming Your Beneficiary  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You designate your beneficiary when you Retire by completing the beneficiary designation section of your enrollment card. If you wish to name more than one
beneficiary, you must also indicate the percentage of your benefit that each beneficiary is to receive. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you do not name a beneficiary, your Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance benefit will be paid to the person you designated under the active employee Company Paid Life Insurance Plan.
If there is no beneficiary designated under that plan, the default beneficiary is your estate. Your failure to designate a beneficiary may delay the payment of funds. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you wish to change your beneficiary designation, complete a new beneficiary form, available from the Dow Benefits Center. A life event (such as marriage/domestic partnership,
divorce/termination of domestic partnership, etc.) may signal a need to change your beneficiary. Beneficiary changes are not effective until the date received by the Dow Benefits Center. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Benefit Payment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of your death, your beneficiary should contact the Dow Benefits Center and present a certified copy of your death certificate. See </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Claims Procedures
Appendix</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of this SPD. Several benefit payment options may be available, including: lump-sum payment, money market fund,
guaranteed interest and others. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Dow Benefits Center staff will explain the options and assist your beneficiary through the claims-filing process. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Accelerated Benefit Option (ABO)  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Accelerated Benefit Option, if you have been diagnosed as having a terminal illness, you may receive a portion of your Retiree Company Paid Life
Insurance and Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance benefits </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>before</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> death. Having access to life proceeds at this important time could help
ease financial and emotional burdens. In order to use ABO, you must be covered for at least $10,000 from your Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance and/or Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life
Insurance. You may receive an accelerated benefit ofup to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5,000 and maximum $250,000) of your Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance and/or Pre-65 Retiree Optional
Life Insurance if, as a result of an injury or sickness you are diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and from which
there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. A claim form can be obtained from the Dow Benefits Center and must be completed and returned for evaluation and approval by MetLife. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Funding  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for Plan I, Dow and the Participating Employers pay the entire cost of the Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance Plan. For Plan I, the Retiree and Dow (or
the Participating Employer) share the cost. The insurance carrier underwriting the Plans may combine the experience for the policy with other policies held by Dow. This means that the costs of these
coverages may be determined on a combined basis, and the costs accumulated from year to year. Favorable experience under one ore more coverages in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience
on other coverages in the same year or offset unfavorable experience of coverages in prior years. Policy dividends declared by the insurer for the Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance Plan attributable
to Dow and the Participating Employer's premiums are used to reduce Dow's cost for the coverage in the same and prior years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>MetLife Demutualization  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, 2000, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) changed from a mutual company to a stock company. As a result, holders of a MetLife insurance
policy on the specific date of September&nbsp;28, 1999 were entitled to receive valuable assets (demutualization assets) from MetLife after April, 2000. The Dow Chemical Company was the policyholder
for the group policy held on behalf of The Dow Chemical Company Group Life Insurance Program (Program) on September&nbsp;28, 1999, and received the right to the demutualization assets in April,
2000. The Company transferred the demutualization assets attributable to Plan I of the Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance Plan to The Dow Chemical Company Employee Welfare Benefit Trust (Welben
Trust). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
the Plan Sponsor, the Company determined the amount of demutualization assets allocable to the retiree contributory portion of the Plan (Option I). An amount was subtracted to pay for
reasonable expenses related to the allocation and distribution of the demutualization assets. As the Plan Sponsor, the Company decided to distribute the Option I demutualization assets to Participants
who were covered under Option I of the Plan on the specific date of September&nbsp;28, 1999 (the individuals are referred to as the "September&nbsp;28, 1999 Participants"). The demutualization
assets will be distributed in the form of cash. The amount to be paid to a particular "September&nbsp;28, 1999 Participant" will be calculated using the following formula: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
premium amount that the particular "September&nbsp;28, 1999 Participant" would have paid for the entire month of September, 1999 (regardless of whether such participant actually
paid premium for the entire month of September, 1999) shall be divided by the total premium amount that would have been
paid by all of the "September&nbsp;28, 1999 Participants" for the entire month of September, 1999 (regardless of whether the premiums were actually paid for the entire month of September), and such
quotient shall be multiplied by the Total Amount of Demutualization Assets Allocated to Option I of the Plan. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cash payments will be distributed to the "September&nbsp;28, 1999 Participants" after June&nbsp;1, 2001, within a timeframe to be set by the Plan Administrator that is
administratively feasible. In any event, the assets should be distributed no later than December&nbsp;31, 2002, unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cash payments will be mailed to the
last known address of the "September&nbsp;28, 1999, Participant". If the payment cannot be delivered by the U.S. Postal Service to such Participant or otherwise is not payable to the Participant
after one (1)&nbsp;year after the check is written, the payment may be used by the Plan Administrator to pay the expenses of the Plan or to pay the expenses of any life insurance plan for which the
Plan Administrator is also the Plan Administrator, as long as such life insurance plan is sponsored by The Dow Chemical Company or one or more of its subsidiaries for the benefit of their respective
employees and eligible dependents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the payment cannot be paid to the Participant because of the Participant's death, the payment will be paid to the beneficiary to whom the life insurance benefit was paid under the
Plan. </FONT></P>

MetLife,&nbsp;Inc. without proof of insurability. You must apply within 31&nbsp;days of the date your Dow coverage decreases. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Introduction  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan ("Plan") provides coverage through a group term life insurance policy that is underwritten by MetLife.
The Plan offers optional group term life insurance to Retirees less than 65&nbsp;years of age. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MetLife
pays the benefits under the Plan. In addition, MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as to whether a Claim for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Eligibility  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a Retiree and were enrolled in The Dow Chemical Company Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan available to active Salaried Employees and
certain Bargained for Employees on the day preceding your Retirement, you are eligible for continued coverage under the Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan until you reach age
65(3); provided, that with respect to Retired Bargained For Employees, the applicable bargaining agreement provides that you are eligible for coverage under this Plan. (Note that UCC retirees are not
"Retirees" under the definition of "Retiree" in the Plan because they are not participants of DEPP). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you were not previously enrolled but are eligible to enroll, you must provide proof of insurability to participate in the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run-out
claims under ERISA Plan #550 (which was terminated effective 12-31-99) for covered claims that were incurred but not yet paid under that plan,
will be paid from the Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you do not meet the above eligibility criteria, check the Plan Document for additional eligible retiree populations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are covered under The Dow Chemical Company Group Life Insurance Program's Union Carbide Subsidiary Basic Life Insurance Plan, you are not eligible for coverage under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Naming Your Beneficiary  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You designate your beneficiary when you Retire by completing the beneficiary designation section of your enrollment card. If you wish to name more than one
beneficiary, you must also indicate the percentage of your benefit that each beneficiary is to receive. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you do not name a beneficiary, your Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance benefit will be paid to the beneficiary you designated when you were an active Employee under
the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan. If you did not designate a beneficiary under the Employee -Paid Life Insurance Plan, then the Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life
Insurance benefit will be paid to the beneficiary you designated under the Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance Plan. If you did not name a beneficiary under the Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance
Plan, your Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance benefit will be paid to the beneficiary you designated under the active employee Company Paid Life Insurance Plan. If you did not name a
beneficiary under the active employee Company Paid Life Insurance Plan, the default beneficiary designation is your estate. Your failure to designate a beneficiary may delay the payment of funds. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you wish to change your beneficiary designation, complete a new beneficiary form, available from your HR Service Center office. A life event (such as Marriage/Domestic Partnership,
divorce/termination of Domestic Partnership, etc.) may signal a need to change your beneficiary. Beneficiary changes are not effective until the date received by the HR Service Center. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Benefit Payment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of your death, your beneficiary should contact the HR Service Center. A certified death certificate must be provided to MetLife to disburse the life
insurance proceeds. See </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claims Procedures Appendix</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of this SPD. Several benefit payment options may be available including lump sum payment, money
market fund, guaranteed interest and others. The HR Service Center staff will inform your beneficiary of the selections available. Contact the HR Service Center at
1-800-344-0661. MetLife can also answer questions regarding payment options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Accelerated Benefit Option (ABO)  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Accelerated Benefit Option, if you have been diagnosed as having a terminal illness, and are less than 63&nbsp;years old when applying for Accelerated
Benefits, you may receive a portion of your Retiree Company Paid Life Insurance and Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance benefits </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>before</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
death. Having access to life proceeds at this important time could help ease financial and emotional burdens. In order to use ABO, you must be covered for at least $10,000 from your Retiree Company
Paid Life Insurance and/or Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance. You may receive an accelerated benefit ofup to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5,000 and maximum $250,000) of your Retiree
Company Paid Life Insurance and/or Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance if, as a result of an injury or sickness you are diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and
from which there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. A claim form can be obtained from the HR Service Center and must be completed and returned for evaluation and approval by MetLife. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Funding  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees pay the entire premium for coverage. The benefits under the Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan and the Retiree Dependent Life
Insurance Plan are not combined for experience with the other insurance coverages. Favorable experience under this insurance coverage in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience in prior
years. It is not anticipated that there will be any future dividends declared for the Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan and the Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plan based on the
manner in which the insurer has determined the premium rates. </FONT></P>

Dorinco, MetLife and Dorinco will each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will
transfer its percentage of each death benefit claim to Metropolitan. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will
be obligated to pay the full amount of the claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the
entire amount of the claim. Neither MetLife nor Dorinco will charge the Plan any administrative fees, commissions or other consideration as a result of the participation of Dorinco. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record is eligible to participate in any dependent life insurance plan sponsored by a Participating Employer, either as a Dow Employee or
Retiree, each of you may insure the other but only one of you may enroll for coverage for your dependent children. Double coverage is not allowed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run-out
claims under ERISA Plan #505 (which was terminated effective 12-31-99) for covered claims that were incurred but not yet paid under that plan,

you do not meet the above eligibility criteria, check the Plan Document for additional eligible retiree populations. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan Administrator determines eligibility. The Plan Administrator is a fiduciary to the Plan and has the full discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings
of fact. Interpretations and eligibility determination by the Plan Administrator are final and binding on Participants. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you want to file&nbsp;a Claim for a Determination of Eligibility because you are not sure whether you are eligible to participate in the Plan or have been told that you are not, see

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> If your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record was covered under

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>Dependent Children:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> For any dependent child who was covered under your Dependent Life Insurance Plan on the day preceding your Retirement,
you may continue coverage equal to $1,000, as long as he or she continues to meet eligibility requirements. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Cost  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your premium for Retiree Dependent Life Insurance is based on the option that you select. The cost for coverage is subject to change, according to Plan
experience. Premiums are subject to change. Changes to premiums are published in DowFriends. If your premiums are not automatically deducted from payments from the Dow Employees' Pension Plan (DEPP)
or the Retirement Program for Employees of Union Carbide Corporation and its Participating Subsidiaries (Union Carbide Retirement Program), you must pay your premium within 31days of your bill. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>If your payment is not
postmarked within 31&nbsp;days of your bill, your coverage will be canceled</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Beneficiary Designation  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the beneficiary of the Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plan. This cannot be changed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Benefit Payment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the death of your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record or dependent child, contact the HR Service Center and present a certified copy of
your death certificate of your dependent. See </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claims Procedures Appendix</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of this SPD. Your benefit will be paid in a lump sum. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Funding  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees pay the entire premium for coverage. The benefits under the Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan and the Retiree Dependent Life
Insurance Plan are not combined for experience with the other insurance coverages. Favorable experience under this insurance coverage in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience in prior
years. It is not anticipated that there will be any future dividends declared for the Pre-65 Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan and the Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plan based on the
manner in which the insurer has determined the premium rates. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Joint Insurance Arrangement  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorinco Reinsurance Company (Dorinco) and MetLife have entered into an arrangement that has been approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in DOL Opinion Letter
97-24A. Under this arrangement, MetLife has or will write the coverage for the Plan, and Dorinco will assume a percentage of the risk. Under the insurance arrangement between MetLife and
Dorinco, MetLife and Dorinco will each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will
transfer its percentage of each death benefit claim to MetLife. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will be
obligated to pay the full amount of the claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the entire
amount of the claim. Neither MetLife nor Dorinco will charge the Plan any administrative fees, commissions or other consideration as a result of the participation of Dorinco. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are a Participant in the Retiree Company-Paid, Pre-65 Retiree Optional or Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plans, you are
entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). This law requires that all Plan Participants must be able to: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Examine,
without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, the Plan Documents and the latest annual reports filed with the
U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Obtain,
upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of the Plan Documents and Summary Plan Descriptions. The Administrator may charge a reasonable
fee for the copies.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Receive
a summary of each Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each Participant with a copy of this summary
annual report. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to creating rights for you and all other Plan Participants, ERISA imposes duties on the people who are responsible for operating an employee benefit plan. The people who
operate the Plans, called "fiduciaries" of the Plans, have a duty to act prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
one, including your employer or any other person, may discharge you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan benefit, or from exercising
your rights under ERISA. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the
decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the legal rights described above. For instance, if you request materials from one of the Plans and do not receive them within
30&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the
materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you must

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>You Must File&nbsp;a Claim in Accordance with These Claims Procedures  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "Claim" is a <U>written</U> request by a claimant for a </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Plan benefit</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> or an </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility
Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. There are two kinds of Claims: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>A
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claim for Plan Benefits</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a request for benefits covered under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>An
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a kind of Claim. It is a request for a determination as to whether a claimant is eligible to be a Participant or covered
Dependent under the Plan. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
must follow the claims procedures for either </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS or CLAIMS FOR AN ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, whichever applies to
your situation. See page 25 for the procedures for </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. See page 25 for procedures for </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Who Will Decide Whether to Approve or Deny My Claim?  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dow Chemical Company will approve or deny a Claim for an Eligibility Determination. The initial determination is made by the Dow Benefit Center. If you
appeal, the appellate decision is made by the Director of Global Benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MetLife
will approve or deny a Claim for Plan Benefits. MetLife is the Claims Administrator for both the initial determination and (if there is an appeal), the appellate determination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>An Authorized Representative May Act On Your Behalf  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Authorized Representative may submit a Claim on behalf of a Plan Participant. The Plan will recognize a person as a Plan Participant's "Authorized
Representative" if such person submits a notarized writing signed by the Participant stating that the Authorized Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such Participant. A court order
stating that a person is authorized to submit Claims on behalf of a Participant will also be recognized by the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Authority Of The Administrators And Your Rights Under ERISA  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrators have the full, complete, and final discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings of fact in order to carry out their
respective Claims decision-making responsibilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretations
and claims decisions by the Administrators are final and binding on Participants. If you are not satisfied with an Administrator's final appellate decision, you may
file&nbsp;a civil action against the Plan under s. 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in a federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so
within 120&nbsp;days from the date of the Administrator's final written decision. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Information Required In Order to Be a "Claim":  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Claims that are requests for Plan benefits, the claimant must complete a MetLife claims form. Call the H.R. Service Center
1-877/623-8079 to obtain a form. (Retirees should call the Retiree Service Center to obtain a form&nbsp;1-800/344-0661). In addition, you must attach

In addition, the person who is reviewing the appeal will not be a subordinate who reports to the person who made the initial decision to deny the Claim. The Administrator will notify you in writing
of its final decision. Such notification will be provided within a reasonable period, not to exceed 60&nbsp;days of the written request for appellate review, except that under special circumstances,
the Administrator may have up to an additional 60&nbsp;days to provide written notification of the final decision. If the Administrator needs such an extension, it will notify you prior to the
expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, state the reason why such an extension is needed, and indicate when it will make its determination. If the Administrator determines that it does not
have sufficient information to make a decision on the Claim prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, it will notify you. It will describe any additional material or information
necessary to submit to the Plan, and provide you with the deadline for submitting such information. The initial 60&nbsp;day time period for the Administrator to make a final written decision, plus
the 60&nbsp;day extension period (if applicable) are tolled from the date the notification of insufficiency is sent to you until the date on which it receives your response. ("Tolled" means the
"clock or time is stopped or suspended". In other words, the deadline for the Administrator to make its decision is "put on hold" until it receives the requested information). The tolling period ends
when the Administrator receives your response, regardless of the adequacy of your response. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Administrator has determined to that its final decision is to deny your Claim, the written notification of the decision will state the reason(s) for the denial and refer to the
