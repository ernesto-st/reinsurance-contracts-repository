<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X.L.
America, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) adopted the X.L. America, Inc. Non-Qualified
Deferred Compensation Plan (the &#147;Prior Plan&#148;), effective as of December 1, 1998.
It was restated and renamed the X.L. America, Inc. Non-Qualified Benefit
Replacement Plan, effective January 1, 2004. Effective January 1, 2004, the
X.L. America, Inc. Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan was merged into this
Plan and the Plan was again restated and renamed the X.L. America, Inc.
Deferred Compensation Plan. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan
was amended and restated effective January 1, 2009, to comply with Code Section
409A, as enacted by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and applicable
regulations thereunder; provided, however, that any provision required to be
effective on and after January 1, 2005 in order for the Plan to comply with
Code Section 409A shall become effective as of January 1, 2005 (or such later
date as shall be permitted under applicable Code Section 409A transition
rules). The Plan is amended and restated January 1, 2012. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan is
unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees,
and is not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code. </FONT></P>

The Administrator shall deem a distribution to be necessary to alleviate a
Hardship if the distribution does not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy
the Participant&#146;s Hardship, plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably
anticipated as a result of the distribution. The Account balance that is not
distributed pursuant to the Hardship request shall remain in the Plan.
Distributions to alleviate a Hardship will be made as soon as administratively
feasible after the Administrator has reviewed and approved the request. An
amount to be distributed for Hardship shall be debited from the Participant&#146;s
Deferred Compensation Account not held in a Scheduled Distribution Sub-Account,
or (if such amount is not sufficient) from the Sub-Account(s) having the latest
scheduled distribution date. </FONT></P>

Section 3.1. A Participant may elect in accordance with Section 3.1.5 to direct

(or, if permitted by the Administrator, more than one) Sub-Account(s), provided
that any such Sub-Account has a scheduled distribution date which is not
earlier than twelve (12) months after the end of the Deferral Period to which
the Elective Deferral relates. The Administrator may establish uniform and
nondiscriminatory rules and procedures governing Scheduled Distribution
Sub-Accounts, </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the
extent permitted by the Administrator at the time of election, such election
may designate whether the elected Scheduled Distribution will be paid as a
result of the Participant&#146;s intervening death, Disability or Termination of
Employment, or alternatively will continue to apply notwithstanding such
intervening event. Except as otherwise elected by a Participant under the
preceding sentence, an election of a Scheduled Distribution shall automatically
terminate upon the Participant&#146;s death, Disability or Termination of Employment
prior to age 65, at which time the provisions of Sections 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6
shall govern distribution of the Participant&#146;s Account; provided, however,
that, unless the Participant elects otherwise with the consent of the
Administrator, (1) a Scheduled Distribution Sub-Account payable at age 65 shall
be paid when the Participant attains age 65, without regard to the
Participant&#146;s intervening Termination of Employment (other than due to death);
and (2) a Participant&#146;s intervening Termination of Employment (other than due
to death) shall not accelerate a Scheduled Distribution then in pay status. </FONT></P>

permitted under Code Section 409A and regulations thereunder, elect to (a)
revoke a Scheduled Distribution (provided that the Participant&#146;s Scheduled
Distribution election would otherwise automatically terminate upon the
Participant&#146;s Termination of Employment for any reason), in which case the
balance of the applicable Sub-Account will be restored to the Participant&#146;s
Deferred Compensation Account, or (b) extend to a later date the date permitted
under Section 6.6 on which a Scheduled Distribution will occur, in which case
the applicable Sub-Account will be redesignated (and merged with another
existing Sub-Account having the same designated distribution date). A
Participant may make an election under the preceding sentence by filing a new
election prior to his or her Termination of Employment at such time and in such
form as the Administrator shall designate. Any election to revoke or extend the
date of a Scheduled Distribution shall not take effect until at least twelve
months after the date on which it is made and must provide for a deferred
distribution date not earlier than five years after the date such Scheduled
Distribution was otherwise scheduled to be made and not later than the date set

shall be entitled to rely upon information furnished by a Participant or
Beneficiary, the Company, the legal counsel of the Company, or such other

believes that he or she is then entitled to receive a benefit under the Plan
may file a claim in writing with the Administrator. Except to the extent the
Committee adopts an alternate procedure for the review of claims, the
procedures in this Section 7.4 shall apply. The Administrator shall, within
ninety (90) days of the receipt of a claim, either allow or deny the claim in
writing. A denial of a claim shall be written in a manner calculated to be
understood by the claimant and shall include: (a) the specific reason or
reasons for the denial; (b) specific references to pertinent Plan provisions on
which the denial is based; (c) a description of any additional material or information
necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such
material or information is necessary; and (d) an explanation of the Plan&#146;s
claim review procedure. A claimant whose claim is denied (or his or her duly
authorized representative) may, within sixty (60) days after receipt of denial
of the claim: (1) submit a written request for review to the Committee; (2)
review pertinent documents; and (3) submit issues and comments in writing. The
Administrator shall notify the claimant of the decision of the Committee on
review within sixty (60) days of receipt of a request. No legal action may be
commenced by a Participant or Beneficiary with respect to a benefit under this
Plan without first exhausting the Plan&#146;s administrative claims procedures, and
any legal action with respect to a claim that has been finally denied must be
commenced no later than one year after the date of the Plan&#146;s final denial of
such claim upon appeal. </FONT></P>

or in any other way make any special provision or specifically earmark any
funds for the payment of amounts called for under the Plan. If the Company
chooses to establish such a fund, or purchase such an annuity contract or make
any other agreement to provide for such payments, that fund, contract or
arrangement shall remain part of the Company&#146;s general assets and no person
claiming payments under the Plan shall have any right, title or interest in or
to any such fund, contract or arrangement. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>Non-assignability</B></U>. None of the
benefits, payments, proceeds or claims of any Participant or Beneficiary shall
be subject to any claim of any creditor of any Participant or Beneficiary and,
in particular, the same shall not be subject to attachment or garnishment or
other legal process by any creditor of such Participant or Beneficiary, nor
shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any right to alienate, anticipate,
commute, pledge, encumber or assign any of the benefits or payments or proceeds
which he or she may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under the
Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall comply with the terms of
a domestic relations order applicable to a Participant&#146;s interest in the Plan,
provided that such order does not require the payment of benefits in a manner
or amount, or at a time, inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. The Company
shall have no liability to any Participant or Beneficiary to the extent that
his or her benefit is reduced in accordance with the terms of a domestic
relations order that the Company applies in good faith. </FONT></P>

all federal, state or local taxes that it reasonably believes are required to
be withheld from any payments under the Plan. </FONT></P>

Nothing contained in the Plan shall confer upon any person a right to be
employed or to continue in the employ of the Company, or interfere in any way
with the right of the Company to terminate the employment of a Participant at
any time, with or without cause. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>Receipt and Release</B></U>. Any payment to any
Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall,
to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against the
Company or the Plan, and the Administrator may require such Participant or
Beneficiary, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and
release to such effect. If requested, such receipt and release shall be
executed by the Participant or Beneficiary no later than 90 days after the
Participant&#146;s scheduled distribution commencement date. If the period for
signing and returning the Release designated by the Company extends into a
later taxable year, any payments contingent upon the Release will be made (or
begin) in the later taxable year. If any Participant or Beneficiary is
determined by the Administrator to be incompetent by reason of physical or mental
disability (including minority) to give a valid receipt and release, the
Administrator may cause the payment or payments becoming due to such person to
be made to another person for his or her benefit without responsibility on the
part of the Administrator or the Company to follow the application of such
funds. </FONT></P>

Participant may designate a Beneficiary by so notifying the Administrator in
writing, in a form acceptable to the Administrator, at any time before the
Participant&#146;s death. A Participant may revoke any Beneficiary designation or
designate a new Beneficiary at any time without the consent of a beneficiary or
any other person. If no Beneficiary is designated or no designated Beneficiary
survives the Participant, payment shall be made in a single lump sum to the
Participant&#146;s estate. </FONT></P>

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and
assigns, and the Participants, and the successors, assigns, designees and
estates of the Participants. The Plan shall also be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of any successor Company or organization succeeding to
substantially all of the assets and business of the Company, but nothing in the
Plan shall preclude the Company from merging or consolidating into or with, or
transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another Company which
assumes the Plan and all obligations of the Company hereunder. The Company
agrees that it will make appropriate provision for the preservation of
Participants&#146; rights under the Plan in any agreement or plan which it may enter
into to effect any such merger, consolidation, reorganization or transfer of
assets. In such a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or transfer of assets
and assumption of Plan obligations of the Company, the term Company shall refer
to such other Company and the Plan shall continue in full force and effect. </FONT></P>

shall be personally liable by reason of any instrument executed by him or on
his behalf, or action taken by him, in his capacity as a Committee member nor
for any mistake of judgment made in good faith. The Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Plan and each Committee member and each employee, officer or
director of the Company or the Plan, to whom any duty, power, function or
action in respect of the Plan may be delegated or assigned, or from whom any
information is requested for Plan purposes, against any cost or expense
(including fees of legal counsel) and liability (including any sum paid in
settlement of a claim or legal action with the approval of the Company) arising
out of anything done or omitted to be done in connection with the Plan, unless
arising out of such person&#146;s fraud or bad faith. </FONT></P>

at any time or from time to time be amended, modified, or terminated by the
Board of Directors. No amendment, modification, or termination shall, without
the consent of a Participant, adversely affect the Participant&#146;s Deferred
Compensation Account at that time. Upon termination of the Plan, the Board of
Directors may elect to (a) pay benefits hereunder as they become due as if the
Plan had not terminated or (b) to extent permitted by Code Section 409A and
regulations thereunder, direct that all payments remaining to be made under the
Plan be made in a single lump sum to Participants (or their Beneficiaries). </FONT></P>
