distribute to such Lender its ratable share of such amount based on its Revolving Facility Percentage of such amount on such date on account

such Lender&rsquo;s participating interest was outstanding and funded); <I>provided, however</I>, that if such payment received by the

Opt-Out</U>. With respect to any prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to <U>Section 2.13(c)(iv)</U> or <U>(v)</U>, the Term Lenders may decline
to accept the applicable prepayment. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any event giving rise to a prepayment under
<U>Section 2.13(c)(iv)</U> or <U>(v)</U> at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall
specify the expected date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment that is required
to be made under <U>Section 2.13(c)(iv)</U> or <U>(v)</U> (the &ldquo;<U>Prepayment Amount</U>&rdquo;). The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Term Lender of the contents of any such prepayment notice so received from the Borrower, including the date on which
such prepayment is to be made (the &ldquo;<U>Prepayment Date</U>&rdquo;). Any Term Lender may decline to accept all (but not less than
all) of its share of any such prepayment (any such Lender, a &ldquo;<U>Declining Lender</U>&rdquo;) by providing written notice to the
Administrative Agent no later than five (5) Business Days after the date of such Term Lender&rsquo;s receipt of notice from the Administrative
Agent regarding such prepayment. If any Term Lender does not give a notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such fifth (5<SUP>th</SUP>)
Business Day informing the Administrative Agent that it declines to accept the applicable prepayment, then such Lender will be deemed
to have accepted such prepayment. On any Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Prepayment Amount minus the portion thereof allocable
to Declining Lenders, in each case for such Prepayment Date, shall be paid to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower and applied by
the Administrative Agent ratably to prepay Term Loans owing to Appropriate Lenders (other than Declining Lenders) in the manner described
in <U>Section 2.13(d)</U> for such prepayment. The remaining amount may be retained by the Borrower (such remaining amounts, the &ldquo;Declined
Amounts&rdquo;).</P>
