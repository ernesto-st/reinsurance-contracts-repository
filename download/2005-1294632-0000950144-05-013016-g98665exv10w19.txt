SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

1. TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW

The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/03 through 9/30/06, with two
one-year options to renew. All contract renewals shall be through contract
amendment. AHCCCSA shall issue amendments prior to the end date of the contract
when there is an adjustment to capitation rates and/or changes to the scope of
service contained herein. Changes to scope of service include but are not
limited to changes in the enrolled population, changes in covered services,
changes in GSA's

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such
contract will be considered separately renewable. AHCCCSA may renew the
Contractor's contract in one GSA, but not in another. In addition, if the
Contractor has had significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may
result in the capping of the Contractor's enrollment in all GSAs. Further,
AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to renew all currently awarded GSA's, or may
terminate the contract if the Contractor does not agree to renew all currently
awarded GSA's.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to the contract, the provisions of such renewal
will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing by
AHCCCSA, even if the amendment has not been signed by the Contractor, unless
within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that it refuses to
sign the renewal amendment. If the Contractor provides such notification,
AHCCCSA will initiate contract termination proceedings.

CONTRACTOR'S NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO RENEW: If the Contractor chooses not to
renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated
with the transition of its members to a different Contractor. If the Contractor
provides AHCCCSA written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at
least 180 days before its expiration, this liability for transition costs may be
waived by AHCCCSA.

CONTRACT TERMINATION: In the event the contract, or any portion thereof, is
terminated for any reason, or expires, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in
the transition of its members to other contractors, and shall abide by standards
and protocols set forth in Paragraph 9, Transition of Members. In addition,
AHCCCSA reserves the right to extend the term of the contract on a
month-to-month basis to assist in any transition of members. The Contractor
shall make provision for continuing all management and administrative services
until the transition of all members is completed and all other requirements of
this contract are satisfied. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing
all reports set forth in this contract and necessary for the transition process
and shall be responsible for the following:

a.   Notification of subcontractors and members.

b.   Payment of all outstanding obligations for medical care rendered to
     members.

c.   Until AHCCCSA is satisfied that the Contractor has paid all such
     obligations, the Contractor shall provide the following reports to AHCCCSA:

     (1)  A monthly claims aging report by provider/creditor including IBNR
          amounts;

     (2)  A monthly summary of cash disbursements;

     (3)  Copies of all bank statements received by the Contractor.

d.   Such reports shall be due on the fifth day of each succeeding month for the
     prior month.

e.   In the event of termination or suspension of the contract by AHCCCSA, such
     termination or suspension shall not affect the obligation of the Contractor
     to indemnify AHCCCSA for any claim by any third party against the State or
     AHCCCSA arising from the Contractor's performance of this contract and for
     which the Contractor would otherwise be liable under this contract.

f.   Any dispute by the Contractor, with respect to termination or suspension of
     this contract by AHCCCSA, shall be exclusively governed by the provisions
     of Section E, Paragraph 26, Disputes.

     after the date of termination, shall be returned to AHCCCSA within 30 days
     of termination of the contract.

2. ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES

AHCCCS is Arizona's Title XIX Medicaid program operating under an 1115 Waiver
and Title XXI program operating under Title XXI State Plan authority. Arizona
has the authority to require mandatory enrollment in managed care. All members
eligible for AHCCCS benefits, with few exceptions, are enrolled with acute care
contractors and paid for on a capitated basis. AHCCCSA pays for health care
expenses on a fee for service (FFS) basis for Title XIX and Title XXI eligible
members who receive services through the Indian Health Service; for Title XIX
eligible members who are entitled to emergency services under the Federal
Emergency Services (FES) program; for Medicare cost sharing beneficiaries under
QMB programs.

The following describes the eligibility groups enrolled in the managed care
program and covered under this contract [42 CFR 434.6(a)(2)].

TITLE XIX

     1931 (ALSO REFERRED TO AS TANF): Eligible individuals and families under
     the 1931 provision of the Social Security Act, with household income levels
     at or below 100% of the FPL.

     SSI AND SSI RELATED GROUPS: Eligible individuals receiving Supplemental
     Security Income (SSI) or who are aged, blind or disabled with household

     under the Title XIX expansion program for women with income up to 250% of
     the FPL, who are diagnosed with and need treatment for breast and/or
     cervical cancer or cervical lesions and are not eligible for other Title
     XIX programs providing full Title XIX services. Eligible members cannot
     have other creditable health insurance coverage, including Medicare.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

TITLE XXI

     KIDSCARE: Individuals under the age of 19, whose income does not exceed
     200% FPL. All members, except Native American members, are required to pay
     a premium amount to AHCCCSA based on the number of children in the family
     and the gross family income.

     HIFA PARENTS: Non-Title XIX-eligible parents of KidsCare children or
     parents of Title XIX SOBRA eligible children who are eligible under the
     HIFA demonstration initiative waiver. HIFA parents are required to pay a

     to $25 per parent (except Native American members), based on household
     income. Due to funding considerations, this program has an enrollment cap.

3. ENROLLMENT AND DISENROLLMENT

AHCCCSA has the exclusive authority to enroll and disenroll members. The
Contractor shall not disenroll any member for any reason unless directed to do
so by AHCCCSA. The Contractor may request AHCCCSA to change the member's
enrollment in accordance with the ACOM Change of Plan Policy. The Contractor may
not request disenrollment because of an adverse change in the member's health
status, or because of the member's utilization of medical services, diminished
mental capacity, or uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from his or
her special needs. An AHCCCS member may request disenrollment from the
Contractor for cause at any time. Refer those requests due to situations defined
in Section A (1) of the ACOM Change of Plan Policy to AHCCCSA to the AHCCCS
Verification Unit via mail or at (602) 417-4000 or (800) 962-6690. For medical
continuity requests, the Contractor shall follow the procedures outlined in the
ACOM Change of Plan Policy, before notifying the AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA will disenroll
the member when the member becomes ineligible for the AHCCCS program, moves out
of the Contractor's service areas, changes contractors during the member's open
enrollment/annual enrollment choice period, the Contractor does not, because of
moral or religious objections, cover the service the member seeks or when
approved for a Contractor change through the ACOM Change of Plan Policy. [42 CFR
438.56] Eligibility for the various AHCCCS coverage groups is determined by one
of the following agencies:

<TABLE>

                                        including the FES program for this
                                        population (aged, disabled, blind), the
                                        Arizona Long-Term Care System (ALTCS),
                                        the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

HEALTH PLAN CHOICE

All AHCCCS members eligible for services covered under this contract have a
choice of available contractors. Information about these contractors will be
given to each applicant during the application process for AHCCCS benefits. If
there is only one contractor available for the applicant's Geographic Service
Area, no choice is offered as long as the contractor offers the member a choice
of PCPs. Members, who do not choose prior to AHCCCSA being notified of their
eligibility, are automatically assigned to a contractor based on family
continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm. Once assigned, AHCCCS sends a
choice notice to the member and gives them 16 days to choose a different
contractor from the auto-assigned contractor. See Section D, Paragraph 6,
Auto-Assignment Algorithm, for further explanation.

The Contractor will share with AHCCCSA the cost of providing information about
the acute care contractors to potential members and to those eligible for annual
enrollment choice.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX members include
previously enrolled members who have been disenrolled for less than 90 days.
These members will be automatically enrolled with the same Contractor, if still
available. Members who have less than 30 days of continued eligibility will not
be enrolled with a Contractor, but will be placed on Fee for Service. FES
members are not enrolled with a contractor. Women, who become eligible for the
Family Planning Services Extension Program, will remain assigned to their
current contractor. Some specialty groups will also be FFS, such as persons
approved only for the inpatient hospital stay. These are inmates who are
temporarily residing in a hospital.

The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX member with the Contractor
is the day AHCCCSA takes the enrollment action, generally the day prior to the
date the Contractor receives notification from AHCCCSA via the daily roster.
However, the Contractor is responsible for payment of medically necessary
covered services retroactive to the member's beginning date of eligibility.

KidsCare members must select a contractor prior to being determined eligible and
therefore, will not be auto-assigned. If the HIFA parent does not choose, they
will be enrolled with their child's contractor following the enrollment rules
set forth in R9-31-1719. When a member is transferred from Title XIX to Title
XXI and has not made a contractor choice for Title XXI, the member will remain
with their current contractor and a choice notice will be sent to the member.
The member may then change plans no later than 16 days from the date the choice
notice is sent.

The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member, including HIFA parents,
will be the first day of the month following notification to the contractor,
with few exceptions.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE: AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for the period of
time, prior to the Title XIX member's enrollment, during which a member is
eligible for covered services. The time frame is from the effective date of
eligibility to the day a member is enrolled with the Contractor. The Contractor
receives notification from the Administration of the member's enrollment. The
Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary
covered services provided to members during prior period coverage. This may
include services provided prior to the contract year (See Section D, Paragraph
53, Compensation, for a description of the Contractor's reimbursement from
AHCCCSA for this eligibility time period.)

NEWBORNS: Newborns, born to AHCCCS eligible mothers enrolled at the time of the
child's birth, will be enrolled with the mother's contractor, when newborn
notification is received by AHCCCSA. The Contractor is responsible for notifying
AHCCCSA of a child's birth to an enrolled member. Capitation for the newborn
will begin on the date notification is received by AHCCCSA (except for cases of
births during prior period coverage). The effective date of AHCCCS eligibility
will be the newborn's date of birth, and the Contractor is responsible for all
covered services to the newborn whether or not AHCCCSA has received notification
of the child's birth. AHCCCSA is currently available to receive notification 24
hours a day, 7 days a week via phone


                                      -18-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

or the AHCCCS website. Eligible mothers of newborns are sent a letter advising
them of their right to choose a different contractor for their child; the date
of the change will be the date of processing the request from the mother. If the
mother does not request a change, the child will remain with the mother's
contractor.

Newborns of FES mothers are auto-assigned to a contractor and mothers of these
newborns are sent a letter advising them of their right to choose a different
contractor for their child. In the event the FES mother chooses a different
contractor, AHCCCS will recoup all capitation paid to the originally assigned
contractor and the baby will be enrolled retroactive to the date of birth in the
second contractor. The second contractor will receive prior period capitation
from the date of birth to the day before assignment and prospective capitation
from the date of assignment forward. The second contractor will be responsible
for all covered services to the newborn from date of birth.

ENROLLMENT GUARANTEES: Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XIX-eligible
member, the member is guaranteed a minimum of five full months of continuous
enrollment. Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XXI-eligible member,
the member is guaranteed a minimum of 12 full months of continuous enrollment.
Enrollment guarantees do not apply to HIFA parents. The enrollment guarantee is
a one-time benefit. If a member changes from one contractor to another within
the enrollment guarantee period, the remainder of the guarantee period applies
to the new contractor. The enrollment guarantee may not be granted or may be
terminated if the member is incarcerated or, if a minor child is adopted. AHCCCS
Rule R9-22, Article 17 and R9-31, Article 3 describes other reasons for which
the enrollment guarantee may not apply.

NATIVE AMERICANS: Native Americans, on or off-reservation, may choose to receive
services from Indian Health Service (IHS), a PL 93-638 tribal facility or any
available contractor. If a choice is not made within the specified time limit,
Native American Title XIX members living on-reservation will be assigned to IHS.
Native American Title XIX members living off-reservation will be assigned to an
available contractor using AHCCCS' Family Continuity Policy and auto-assignment
algorithm. Native American Title XXI members must make a choice prior to being
determined eligible. Title XXI HIFA parent members' enrollment will follow the
Title XIX enrollment rules. Native Americans may change from IHS to a contractor
or from a contractor to IHS at any time.

MEMBER RIGHTS: Members may submit plan change requests to the Contractor or the
AHCCCS Administration. A denial of any plan change request must include a
description of the member's right to appeal the denial.

4.   ANNUAL ENROLLMENT CHOICE

AHCCCSA conducts an Annual Enrollment Choice (AEC) for members on their annual
anniversary date. [42 CFR 438.56(c)(2)(ii)] AHCCCSA may hold an open enrollment
as deemed necessary. During AEC, members may change contractors subject to the
availability of other contractors within their Geographic Service Area. Members
are mailed a printed enrollment form and other information required by the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) 60 days prior to their AEC date and may choose
a new contractor by contacting AHCCCSA to complete the enrollment process. If
the member does not participate in the AEC, no change of contractor will be made
(except for approved changes under the ACOM Change of Plan Policy) during the
new anniversary year. This holds true if a contractor's contract is renewed and
the member continues to live in a contractor's service area. The Contractor
shall comply with the ACOM Member Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice, Open
Enrollment and Other Plan Changes Policy and the AMPM.

5.   OPEN ENROLLMENT

In the event that AHCCCSA does not award a CYE '04 contract to an incumbent
contractor, AHCCCSA will hold an open enrollment for those members enrolled with
the exiting contractor. If those members do not elect to choose a contractor,
they will be auto assigned. In addition to open enrollment, AHCCCSA will make


                                      -19-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

changes to both annual enrollment choice materials and new enrollee materials
prior to October 1, 2003 to reflect the change in available contractors. The
auto assignment algorithm will be adjusted to exclude auto assignment of new
enrollees to exiting contractors(s). The exact dates for the open enrollment and
other changes described above have not yet been determined, but will be
communicated when they are finalized.

6.   AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Once auto-assigned, AHCCCS sends a choice notice to the member and gives them 16
days to choose a different contractor from the auto-assigned contractor. Members
who do not exercise their right to choose and do not have family continuity, are
assigned to a contractor through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is
a mathematical formula used to distribute members to the various contractors in
a manner that is predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals. The algorithm
favors those contractors with lower capitation rates in the latest contract
award and higher rates in selected Performance Measures. For further details on
the AHCCCS Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G. AHCCCSA may change
the algorithm at any time during the term of the contract in response to
contractor-specific issues (e.g. imposition of an enrollment cap). Capitation
rates may be adjusted to reflect changes to a contractor's risk due to changes
in the algorithm.

7.   AHCCCS MEMBER IDENTIFICATION CARDS

Contractors are responsible for paying the costs of producing AHCCCS member
identification cards. The Contractor will receive an invoice the month following
the issue date of the identification card.

8.   MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS

To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall take affirmative
action so that members are provided covered services without regard to payer
source, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin (to include
those with limited English proficiency), ancestry, marital status, sexual
preference, genetic information, or physical or mental handicap, except where
medically indicated. Contractors must take into account a member's culture, when
addressing members and their concerns, and must take reasonable steps to
encourage subcontractors to do the same. The Contractor must make interpreters
of any language available free of charge for all members to ensure appropriate
delivery of covered services. The Contractor must provide members with
information instructing them about how to access these services.

Examples of prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, the following,
in accordance with Title VI of the US Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC, Section
2001, Executive Order 13166, and rules and regulation promulgated according to,
or as otherwise provided by law:

a.   Denying or not providing a member any covered service or access to an
     available facility.

b.   Providing to a member any covered service which is different, or is
     provided in a different manner or at a different time from that provided to
     other members, other public or private patients or the public at large,
     except where medically necessary.

c.   Subjecting a member to segregation or separate treatment in any manner
     related to the receipt of any covered service; restricting a member in any
     way in his or her enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others
     receiving any covered service.

d.   The assignment of times or places for the provision of services on the
     basis of the race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, national origin,
     ancestry, marital status, sexual preference, income status, AHCCCS
     membership, or physical or mental handicap of the participants to be
     served.

If the Contractor knowingly executes a subcontract with a provider with the
intent of allowing or permitting the subcontractor to implement barriers to care
(i.e. the terms of the subcontract act to discourage the full utilization of
services by some members), the Contractor will be in default of its contract.

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

If the Contractor identifies a problem involving discrimination by one of its
providers, it shall promptly intervene and implement a corrective action plan.
Failure to take prompt corrective measures may place the Contractor in default
of its contract.

9. TRANSITION OF MEMBERS

The Contractor shall comply with the AMPM, and the ACOM Member Transition for
Annual Enrollment Choice, Open Enrollment and Other Plan Changes Policy
standards for member transitions between contractors or GSAs, participation in
or discharge from CRS, to or from an ALTCS Contractor, IHS, a PL 93-638 tribal
entity, and upon termination or expiration of a contract. The Contractor shall
develop and implement policies and procedures, which comply with these policies
to address transition of:

a.   Members with significant medical conditions such as a high-risk pregnancy
     or pregnancy within the last 30 days, the need for organ or tissue
     transplantation, chronic illness resulting in hospitalization or nursing
     facility placement, etc.;

b.   Members who are receiving ongoing services such as dialysis, home health,
     chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or who are hospitalized at the time
     of transition;

c.   Members who have received prior authorization for services such as
     scheduled surgeries, out-of-area specialty services, nursing home
     admission;

d.   Prescriptions, DME and medically necessary transportation ordered for the
     transitioning member by the relinquishing contractor; and

e.   Medical records of the transitioning member (the cost, if any, of
     reproducing and forwarding medical records shall be the responsibility of
     the relinquishing AHCCCS contractor).

When relinquishing members, the Contractor is responsible for timely
notification to the receiving contractor regarding pertinent information related
to any special needs of transitioning members. The Contractor, when receiving a
transitioning member with special needs, is responsible for coordinating care
with the relinquishing contractor in order that services not be interrupted, and
for providing the new member with contractor and service information, emergency
numbers and instructions about how to obtain services.

10. SCOPE OF SERVICES

The Contractor shall provide covered services to AHCCCS members in accordance
with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, rules, regulations and
policies, including services listed in this document, listed by reference in
attachments, and AHCCCS policies referenced in this document. The services are
described in detail in AHCCCS Rules R9-22, Article 2 and the AHCCCS Medical
Policy Manual (AMPM), all of which are incorporated herein by reference, except
for provisions specific to the Fee-for-Service program, and may be found in the
Bidder's Library. [42 CFR 438.210(a)(1)] The covered services must be medically
necessary and are briefly described below. [42 CFR 438.210(a)(4)] Except for
annual well woman exams, behavioral health and children's dental services,
covered services must be provided by, or coordinated with, a primary care
provider. The Contractor shall coordinate the services it provides to a member
with services the member receives from other entities, including behavioral
health services the member receives through an ADHS/RBHA provider. The
Contractor shall ensure that, in the process of coordinating care, each member's
privacy is protected in accordance with the privacy requirements in 45 CFR Parts
160 and 164 Subparts A and E, to the extent that they are applicable. [42 CFR
438.208(b)(4) and 438.224] Services must be rendered by providers that are
appropriately licensed or certified, operating within their scope of practice,
and registered as an AHCCCS provider. The Contractor shall provide the same
standard of care for all members regardless of the member's eligibility
category. The Contractor shall ensure that the services are sufficient in
amount, duration, or scope to reasonably be expected to achieve the purpose for
which the services are furnished. The Contractor shall not arbitrarily deny or
reduce the amount, duration, or scope of a required service solely because of
diagnosis, type of illness, or condition of the member. The Contractor may place
appropriate limits


                                      -21-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

on a service on the basis of criteria such as medical necessity; or for
utilization control, provided the services furnished can reasonably be expected
to achieve their purpose. [42 CFR 438.210(a)(3)]

Authorization of Services: For the processing of requests for initial and
continuing authorizations of services, the Contractor shall have in place, and
follow, written policies and procedures. The Contractor shall have mechanisms in
place to ensure consistent application of review criteria for authorization
decisions. Any decision to deny a service authorization request or to" authorize
a service in an amount, duration, or scope that is less than requested, shall be
made by a health care professional who has appropriate clinical expertise in
treating the member's condition or disease. [42 CFR 438.210(b)]

Notice of Action: The Contractor shall notify the requesting provider, and give
the member written notice of any decision by the Contractor to deny a service
authorization request, or to authorize a service in an amount, duration, or
scope that is less than requested. The notice shall meet the requirements of 42
CFR 438.404, except for the requirement that the notice to the provider be in
writing. [42 CFR 438.210(c)]

The Contractor shall ensure that its providers are not restricted or inhibited
in any way from communicating freely with members regarding the members' health
care, medical needs and treatment options, even if needed services are not
covered by the Contractor.

AMBULATORY SURGERY AND ANESTHESIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide surgical
services for either emergency or scheduled surgeries when provided in an
ambulatory or outpatient setting such as a freestanding surgical center or a
hospital based outpatient surgical setting.

ANTI-HEMOPHILIC AGENTS AND RELATED SERVICES: The Contractor shall provide
services for the treatment of hemophilia and Von Willebrands disease (See
Paragraph 57, REINSURANCE, Catastrophic Reinsurance). AHCCCSA holds a
single-source specialty contract for anti-hemophilic agents and related services
for hemophilia. Non-hemophilia related services are not covered under this
contract. Non-hemophilia-related care is defined as any care that is provided
not related to the hemophilia services.

AHCCCSA's participating Contractors may access anti-hemophilic agents and
related pharmaceutical services for hemophilia or Von Willebrands under the
terms and conditions of this contract for members enrolled in their plans. In
that instance, the Contractor is the authorizing payor. As such, the Contractor
will provide prior authorization, care coordination, and reimbursement for all
components covered under the contract for their members. Contractors utilizing
the contract will comply with the terms and conditions of the contract.
Contractors may use the AHCCCSA contract or contract with a provider of their
choice.

AUDIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide audiology services to members under the
age of 21 including the identification and evaluation of hearing loss and
rehabilitation of the hearing loss through medical or surgical means (i.e.
hearing aids). Only the identification and evaluation of hearing loss are
covered for members 21 years of age and older unless the hearing loss is due to
an accident or injury-related emergent condition.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: The Contractor shall provide behavioral health services as
described in Section D, Paragraph 12, Behavioral Health Services.

CHILDREN'S REHABILITATIVE SERVICES (CRS): The program for children with
CRS-covered conditions is administered by the Arizona Department of Health
Services (ADHS) for children who meet CRS eligibility criteria. The Contractor
shall refer children to the CRS program who are potentially eligible for
services related to CRS covered conditions, as specified in R9-22, Article 2 and
A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 2, Article 3. The Contractor is responsible for care of
members until Children's Rehabilitative Services Administration (CRSA)
determines those members eligible. In addition, the Contractor is responsible
for covered services for CRS eligible members unless and until the Contractor
has received written confirmation from CRSA that CRSA will provide the requested
service. The Contractor shall require the member's Primary Care Provider (PCP)
to coordinate the member's care with the CRS Program. For more detailed
information regarding


                                      -22-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

eligibility criteria, referral practices, and contractor-CRS coordination
issues, refer to the CRS Policy and Procedures Manual and the ACOM, including
Section 409 "Notices of Action."

The Contractor shall respond to requests for services potentially covered by
CRSA in accordance with Section 409 "Notices of Action" of the ACOM. The
Contractor is responsible to address prior authorization requests if CRSA fails
to comply with the timeframes specified in Section 409. The Contractor remains
ultimately responsible for the provision of all covered services to its members,
including emergency services not related to a CRS condition, emergency services
related to a CRS condition rendered outside the CRS network, and AHCCCS covered
services denied by CRSA for the reason that it is not a service related to a CRS
condition.

Referral to CRSA does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for
timely providing medically necessary AHCCCS services not covered by CRSA. In the
event that CRSA denies a medically necessary AHCCCS service for the reason that
it is not related to a CRS condition, the Contractor must promptly respond to
the service authorization request and authorize the provision of medically
necessary services. CRSA cannot contest the Contractor prior authorization
determination if CRSA fails to timely respond to a service authorization
request. Contractors, through their Medical Directors, may request review from
CRSA when it denies a service for the reason that it is not covered by the CRS
Program. The Contractor may also request a hearing with the Administration if it
is dissatisfied with the CSRA determination. If the AHCCCS Hearing Decision
determines that the service should have been provided by CRSA, CRSA shall be
financially responsible for the costs incurred by the Contractor in providing
the service.

A member with private insurance is not required to utilize CRSA. If the member
uses the private insurance network for a CRS covered condition, the Contractor
is responsible for all applicable deductibles and copayments. When the private
insurance is exhausted with respect to CRS covered conditions, the Contractor
shall refer the member to CRSA for determination for CRS services. The
Contractor is not responsible to provide services in instances when the CRS
eligible member refuses to receive CRS covered services through the CRS Program.
If the Contractor becomes aware that a member with a CRS covered condition
refuses to participate in the CRS application process or refuses to receive
services through the CRS Program, the member may be billed by the provider in
accordance with AHCCCS regulations regarding billing for unauthorized services.

CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES: The Contractor shall provide chiropractic services to
members under age 21 when prescribed by the member's PCP and approved by the
Contractor in order to ameliorate the member's medical condition. Medicare
approved chiropractic services shall also be covered, subject to limitations
specified in CFR 410.22, for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries if prescribed by
the member's PCP and approved by the Contractor.

DENTAL: The Contractor shall provide all members under the age of 21 with all
medically necessary dental services including emergency dental services, dental
screening and preventive services in accordance with the AHCCCS periodicity
schedule, as well as therapeutic dental services, dentures, and
pre-transplantation dental services. The Contractor shall monitor compliance
with the EPSDT periodicity schedule for dental screening services. The
Contractor is required to meet specific utilization rates for members as
described in Section D, Paragraph 24, Performance Standards. The Contractor
shall ensure that members are notified when dental screenings are due if the
member has not been scheduled for a visit. If a dental screening is not received
by the member, a second notice must be sent. Members under the age of 21 may
request dental services without referral and may choose a dental provider from
the Contractor's provider network. For members who are 21 years of age and
older, the Contractor shall provide emergency dental care, medically necessary
dentures and dental services for transplantation services as specified in the
AMPM.

DIALYSIS: The Contractor shall provide medically necessary dialysis, supplies,
diagnostic testing and medication for all members when provided by
Medicare-certified hospitals or Medicare-certified end stage renal disease
(ESRD) providers. Services may be provided on an outpatient basis, or on an
inpatient basis if the hospital admission is not solely to provide chronic
dialysis services.

shall provide comprehensive health care services through primary prevention,
early intervention, diagnosis and medically necessary treatment to correct or
ameliorate defects and physical or mental illness discovered by the screenings

required health screenings, including those for developmental/behavioral health,
in compliance with the AHCCCS periodicity schedule. The Contractor shall submit
all EPSDT reports to the AHCCCS Division of Health Care Management, as required
by the AMPM. The Contractor is required to meet specific
participation/utilization rates for members as described in Section D, Paragraph
24, Performance Standards.

The Contractor shall ensure the initiation and coordination of a referral to the
ADHS/RBHA system for members in need of behavior health services. The Contractor

health services.

EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Contractor shall have and/or provide the following as a
minimum:

     a.   Emergency services facilities adequately staffed by qualified medical
          professionals to provide pre-hospital, emergency care on a
          24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis, for the sudden onset of a medically
          emergent condition. Emergency medical services are covered without
          prior authorization. The Contractor is encouraged to contract with
          emergency service facilities for the provision of emergency services.
          The Contractor is also encouraged to contract with or employ the
          services of non-emergency facilities (e.g. urgent care centers) to
          address member non-emergency care issues occurring after regular
          office hours or on weekends. The Contractor shall be responsible for
          educating members and providers regarding appropriate utilization of
          emergency room services including behavioral health emergencies. The
          Contractor shall monitor emergency service utilization (by both
          provider and member) and shall have guidelines for implementing
          corrective action for inappropriate utilization;

     b.   All medical services necessary to rule out an emergency condition;

     c.   Emergency transportation; and

     d.   Member access by telephone to a physician, registered nurse, physician
          assistant or nurse practitioner for advice in emergent or urgent
          situations, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

Per the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, CFR 438.114, the following conditions apply
with respect to coverage and payment of emergency services:

The Contractor must cover and pay for emergency services regardless of whether
the provider that furnishes the service has a contract with the Contractor.

The Contractor may not deny payment for treatment obtained under either of the
following circumstances:

     1.   A member had an emergency medical condition, including cases in which
          the absence of medical attention would not have resulted in the
          outcomes identified in the definition of emergency medical condition
          CFR 438.114.

     2.   A representative of the Contractor (an employee or subcontracting
          provider) instructs the member to seek emergency medical services.

Additionally, the Contractor may not:

     1.   Limit what constitutes an emergency medical condition as defined in
          CFR 438.114, on the basis of lists of diagnoses or symptoms.

     2.   Refuse to cover emergency services based on the failure of the
          provider, hospital, or fiscal agent to notify the Contractor of the
          member's screening and treatment within 10 calendar days of
          presentation for emergency services. This notification stipulation is
          only related to the provision of emergency services.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

     3.   Require notification of Emergency Department treat and release visits
          as a condition of payment unless the plan has prior approval of the
          AHCCCS Administration.

A member who has an emergency medical condition may not be held liable for
payment of subsequent screening and treatment needed to diagnose the specific
condition or stabilize the patient.

The attending emergency physician, or the provider actually treating the member,
is responsible for determining when the member is sufficiently stabilized for
transfer or discharge, and such determination is binding on the Contractor
responsible for coverage and payment. The Contractor shall comply with BBA
guidelines regarding the coordination of post-stabilization care.

EYE EXAMINATIONS/OPTOMETRY: The Contractor shall provide all medically necessary
emergency eye care, vision examinations, prescriptive lenses, and treatments for
conditions of the eye for all members under the age of 21. For members who are

pregnancy. These include medical, surgical, pharmacological and laboratory
services, as well as contraceptive devices. Information and counseling, which
allow members to make informed decisions regarding family planning methods,

services, it must contract for these services through another health care
delivery system, which allows members freedom of choice in selecting a provider.

The Contractor shall provide services to members enrolled in the Family Planning
Services Extension Program, a program that provides family planning services
only, for a maximum of 24 months, to women whose SOBRA eligibility has
terminated. The Contractor is also responsible for notifying AHCCCSA when a

Family Planning Services Extension Program. Notification should be made at the
time the newborn is reported or after the sterilization procedure is completed.

HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT AND SCREENING: The Contractor shall provide these

HOSPITAL: Inpatient services include semi-private accommodations for routine
care, intensive and coronary care, surgical care, obstetrics and newborn
nurseries, and behavioral health emergency/crisis services. If the member's
medical condition requires isolation, private inpatient accommodations are

Contractor, in an IHS or a 638 tribal facility. The Contractor is responsible
for reimbursement to IHS or tribal facilities for emergency services provided to
Title XXI Native American members enrolled with the Contractor. The Contractor

provider network for the delivery of covered services, however, the Contractor
will be liable for the cost of the care in the event they choose to do so.

LABORATORY: Laboratory services for diagnostic, screening and monitoring
purposes are covered when provided by a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Act) approved free standing, hospital, clinic, physician office or other health
care facility laboratory.

network that offer home labor and delivery services. All members, anticipated to
have a low-risk prenatal course and delivery, may elect to receive prenatal
care, labor and delivery and postpartum care provided by licensed midwives, if
these providers are in the Contractor's network. All licensed midwife labor and
delivery services must be provided in the member's home, as licensed midwives do
not have admitting privileges in hospitals or AHCCCS registered freestanding

the end of the second and fourth quarters of the contract year.

MEDICAL FOODS: Medical foods are covered within limitations defined in the AMPM
for members diagnosed with a metabolic condition included under the ADHS Newborn

MEDICAL SUPPLIES, DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME), ORTHOTIC AND PROSTHETIC
DEVICES: These services are covered when prescribed by the member's PCP,
attending physician, practitioner, or by a dentist. Medical equipment may be
rented or purchased only if other sources, which provide the items at no cost,
are not available. The total cost of the rental must not exceed the purchase
price of the item. Reasonable repairs or adjustments of purchased equipment are
covered to make the equipment serviceable and/or when the repair cost is less
than renting or purchasing another unit.

NURSING FACILITY: The Contractor shall provide services in nursing facilities,
including religious non-medical health care institutions, for members who
require short-term convalescent care not to exceed 90 days per contract year. In
lieu of a nursing facility, the member may be placed in an assisted living

services. See Paragraph 41, Nursing Facility Reimbursement, for further details.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services, in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage, if the stay
goes beyond the 90-day maximum.

NUTRITION: Nutritional assessments may be conducted as a part of the EPSDT
screenings for members under age 21, and to assist members 21 years of age and

systemic disease which prohibits care by a nonprofessional person.

POST-STABILIZATION CARE SERVICES COVERAGE AND PAYMENT: Pursuant to 42 CFR
438.114, 422.113(c) and 422.133, the following conditions apply with respect to
coverage and payment of emergency and of post-stabilization care services,
except where otherwise noted in the contract:

The Contractor must cover and pay for post-stabilization care services without
authorization, regardless of whether the provider that furnishes the service has
a contract with the Contractor, for the following situations:

     1.   Post-stabilization care services that were pre-approved by the
          Contractor; or,

     2.   Post-stabilization care services were not pre-approved by the
          Contractor because the Contractor did not respond to the treating
          provider's request for pre-approval within one hour after being
          requested to approve such care or could not be contacted for
          pre-approval.

     3.   The Contractor representative and the treating physician cannot reach
          agreement concerning the member's care and a contractor physician is
          not available for consultation. In this situation, the Contractor must
          give the treating physician the opportunity to consult with a
          contractor physician and the treating physician may continue with care
          of the patient until a contractor physician is reached or one of the
          criteria in CFR 422.113(c)(3) is met.

Pursuant to CFR 422.113(c)(3), the Contractor's financial responsibility for
post-stabilization care services that have not been pre-approved ends when:

     1.   A contractor physician with privileges at the treating hospital
          assumes responsibility for the member's care;

     2.   A contractor physician assumes responsibility for the member's care
          through transfer;

     3.   A contractor representative and the treating physician reach an
          agreement concerning the member's care; or

     4.   The member is discharged.

PREGNANCY TERMINATIONS: AHCCCS covers pregnancy termination if the pregnant
member suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness,
including a life endangering physical condition caused by, or arising from, the
pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a physician, place the member in
danger of death unless the pregnancy is terminated; the pregnancy is a result of
rape or incest.

The attending physician must acknowledge that a pregnancy termination has been
determined medically necessary by submitting the Certificate of Necessity for

Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Medicaid services must be identified in
the member's Individual Education Plan (IEP) as medically necessary for the
child to obtain a public school education.

MSBC services are provided in a school setting or other approved setting
specifically to allow children to receive a public school education. They do not
replace medically necessary services provided outside the school setting or
other MSBC approved alternative setting. Currently, services include audiology,
therapies (OT, PT and speech/language); behavioral health evaluation and
counseling; nursing and attendant care; and specialized transportation. The
Contractor's evaluations and determinations, about whether services are
medically necessary, should be made independent of the fact that the child is
receiving MSBC services.

Contractors and their providers must coordinate with schools and school
districts that provide MSBC services to the Contractor's enrolled members.
Services should not be duplicative. Contractor case managers, working with
special needs children, should coordinate with school or school district case
managers/special education teachers, working with these members. Transfer of

21. MEDICAL RECORDS

The member's medical record is the property of the provider who generates the
record. Each member is entitled to one copy of his or her medical record free of
charge. The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures to maintain
the confidentiality of all medical records.

The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical record is established
when information is received about a member. If the PCP has not yet seen the
member, such information may be kept temporarily in an appropriately labeled
file, in lieu of establishing a medical record, but must be associated with the
member's medical record as soon as one is established.

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures for the maintenance of
medical records so that those records are documented accurately and in a timely
manner, are readily accessible, and permit prompt and systematic retrieval of
information.

The Contractor shall have written standards for documentation on the medical
record for legibility, accuracy and plan of care, which comply with the AMPM.

The Contractor shall have written plans for providing training and evaluating
providers' compliance with the Contractor's medical records standards. Medical
records shall be maintained in a detailed and comprehensive manner, which
conforms to good professional medical practice, permits effective professional
medical review and medical audit processes, and which facilitates an adequate
system for follow-up treatment. Medical records must be legible, signed and
dated.

When a member changes PCPs, his or her medical records or copies of medical
records must be forwarded to the new PCP within 10 business days from receipt of
the request for transfer of the medical records.

AHCCCSA is not required to obtain written approval from a member, before
requesting the member's medical record from the PCP or any other agency. The
Contractor may obtain a copy of a member's medical records without written
approval of the member, if the reason for such request is directly related to
the administration of the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA shall be afforded access to
all members' medical records whether electronic or paper within 20 business days
of receipt of request.

Information related to fraud and abuse may be released so long as protected
HIV-related information is not disclosed (A.R.S. Section 36-664(1)).

22. ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

In accordance with 42 CFR 422.128, the Contractor shall maintain policies and
procedures addressing advanced directives for adult members that specify:

a.   Each contract or agreement with a hospital, nursing facility, home health
     agency, hospice or organization responsible for providing personal care,
     must comply with Federal and State law regarding advance directives for
     adult members [42 CFR 438.6(i)(l)]. Requirements include:

     (1)  Maintaining written policies that address the rights of adult members
          to make decisions about medical care, including the right to accept or
          refuse medical care, and the right to execute an advance directive. If
          the agency/organization has a conscientious objection to carrying out
          an advance directive, it must be explained in policies. (A health care
          provider is not prohibited from making such objection when made
          pursuant to A.R.S. Section 36-3205.C.I.)

          execute or not execute an advance directive, and not making it a
          condition for the provision of care.

     (5)  Providing education to staff on issues concerning advance directives
          including notification of direct care providers of services, such as
          home health care and personal care, of any advanced directives
          executed by members to whom they are assigned to provide services.

b.   Contractors shall require subcontracted PCPs, which have agreements with
     the entities described in paragraph a. above, to comply with the
     requirements of subparagraphs a. (2) through (5) above. Contractors shall
     also encourage health care providers specified in subparagraph a. to
     provide a copy of the member's executed advanced directive, or
     documentation of refusal, to the member's PCP for inclusion in the member's
     medical record.

c.   The Contractor shall provide written information to adult members that
     describe the following:

     (1)  A member's rights under State law, including a description of the
          applicable State law

24. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES:

The maximum allowable speed of answer (SOA) is 45 seconds. The SOA is defined as
the on line wait time in seconds that the member/provider waits from the moment
the call is connected in the Contractor's phone switch until the call is picked
up by a contractor representative or Interactive Voice Recognition System (IVR).
If the Contractor has IVR capabilities, callers must be given the choice of
completing their call by IVR or by contractor representative.

The Contractor shall meet the following standards for its member services and
centralized provider telephone line statistics. All calls to the line shall be
included in the measure.

          a.   The Monthly Average Abandonment Rate shall be 5% or less;

          b.   First Contact Call Resolution shall be 70% or better; and

          c.   The Monthly Average Service Level shall be 75% or better.

The Monthly Average Abandonment Rate (AR) is:

                  Number of calls abandoned in a 24-hour period
                  --------------------------------------------------
                  Total number of calls received in a 24-hour period

The ARs are then summed and divided by the number of days in the reporting
period.

First Contact Call Resolution Rate (FCCR) is:

          Number of calls received in 24-hour period for which no follow up
          communication or internal phone transfer is needed, divided by Total
          number of calls received in 24-hour period

The daily FCCRs are then summed and divided by the number of days in the
reporting period.

The Monthly Average Service Level (MASL) is:

             Calls answered within 45 seconds for the month reported
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Total of month's answered calls + month's abandoned calls + (if available)
                      month's calls receiving a busy signal

Note: Do not use average daily service levels divided by the days in the
reporting period.

On a monthly basis the measures are to be reported for both the Member Services
and Provider telephone lines. For each of the Administrative Measures a. through
c., the Contractor shall also report the number of days in the reporting period
that the standard was not met. The Contractor shall include in the report the
instances of down time for the centralized telephone lines, the dates of
occurrence and the length of time they were out of service. The reports should
be sent to the Contractor's assigned Operations and Compliance Officer in the


                                      -40-

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Health Plan Operations Unit of the Division of Health Care Management. The
deadline for submission of the reports is the 15th day of the month following
the reporting period (or the first business day following the 15th). Back up
documentation for the report, to the level of measured segments in the 24-hour
period, shall be retained for a rolling 12-month period. AHCCCSA will review the
performance measure calculation procedures and source data for this report.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES:

All Performance Measures described below apply to all member populations [42 CFR
438.240(a)(2), (b)(2) and (c)].

Contractors must meet AHCCCS stated Minimum Performance Standards. However, it
is equally important that Contractors continually improve their performance
measure outcomes from year to year. Contractors shall strive to meet the
ultimate standard, or benchmark, established by AHCCCS.

AHCCCS has established three levels of performance:

     MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARD -- A Minimum Performance Standard is the
     minimal expected level of performance by the Contractor. If a Contractor
     does not achieve this standard, or any measure rate declines to a level
     below the AHCCCS Minimum Performance Standard, the Contractor will be
     required to submit a corrective action plan and may be subject to
     sanctions.

     GOAL -- A Goal is a reachable standard for a given performance measure for
     the Contract Year. If the Contractor has already met or exceeded the AHCCCS
     Minimum Performance Standard for any measure, the Contractor must strive to
     meet the established Goal for the measure(s).

     BENCHMARK -- A Benchmark is the ultimate standard to be achieved.
     Contractors that have already achieved or exceeded the Goal for any
     performance measure must strive to meet the Benchmark for the measure(s).
     Contractors that have achieved the Benchmark are expected to maintain this
     level of performance for future years.

A Contractor must show demonstrable and sustained improvement toward meeting
AHCCCS Performance Standards. In addition to corrective action plans, AHCCCS may
impose sanctions on Contractors that do not meet the Minimum Performance
Standard and do not show statistically significant improvement in a measure rate
and/or require those Contractors to demonstrate that they are allocating
increased administrative resources to improving rates for a particular measure
or service area. AHCCCS also may require a corrective action plan of any
Contractor that shows a statistically significant decrease in its rate, even if
it meets or exceeds the Minimum Performance Standard.

The corrective action plan must be received by AHCCCS within 30 days of receipt
of notification from AHCCCS. This plan must be approved by AHCCCS prior to
implementation. AHCCCS may conduct one or more follow-up on-site reviews to
verify compliance with a corrective action plan.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES: The Contractor shall comply with AHCCCS quality management
requirements to improve performance for all AHCCCS established performance
measures. Complete descriptions of these measures can be found in the most
recently published results and analysis of acute-care performance measures, or
upon request from AHCCCSA. The measures for postpartum visits and low birth
weight deliveries have been eliminated as contractual performance standards. The
Contractor shall continue to monitor rates for postpartum visits and low birth
weight deliveries and implement interventions as necessary to improve or sustain
these rates. These activities will be monitored by AHCCCSA during the
Operational and Financial Review.

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

CMS has been working in partnership with states in developing core performance
measures for Medicaid and SCHIP programs. The current AHCCCS established
performance measures may be subject to change when these core measures are
finalized and implemented.

In addition, AHCCCS has established standards for the following measures:

EPSDT PARTICIPATION: The Contractor shall take affirmative steps to increase
member participation in the EPSDT program. The participation rate is the number
of children younger than 21 years receiving at least one medical screen during
the contract year, compared to the number of children expected to receive at
least one medical screen. The number of children expected to receive at least
one medical screen is based on the AHCCCS EPSDT periodicity schedule and the
average period of eligibility.

The following table identifies the Minimum Performance Standards, Goals and
Benchmarks for each measure:

the data request may result in sanctions imposed on the Contractor.

The Contractor shall participate in immunization audits, at intervals specified
by AHCCCSA, based on random sampling to verify the immunization status of
members at 24 months of age. If records are missing for more than 5 percent of
the Contractor's final sample, the Contractor is subject to sanctions by
AHCCCSA. An External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) may conduct a study to
validate the Contractor's reported rates.

25. GRIEVANCE SYSTEM

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance system for
subcontractors, enrollees and providers, which defines their rights regarding
disputed matters with the Contractor. The Contractor's grievance system for
enrollees includes a grievance process (the procedures for addressing enrollee
grievances), an appeals process and access to the state's fair hearing process.
The Contractor shall provide the appropriate personnel to establish, implement
and maintain the necessary functions related to the grievance systems process.
Refer to Attachments H(l) and H(2) for Enrollee Grievance System and Provider
Grievance System Standards and Policy, respectively.

The Contractor may delegate the grievance system process to subcontractors,
however, the Contractor must ensure that standards which are delegated comply
with applicable Federal and State laws, regulations and policies, including, but
not limited to 42 CFR Part 438 Subpart F. The Contractor shall remain
responsible for compliance with all requirements. The Contractor shall also
ensure that it timely provides written information to both enrollees and
providers, which clearly explains the grievance system requirements. This
information must include a description of: the right to a state fair hearing,
the method for obtaining a state fair hearing, the rules that govern
representation at the hearing, the right to file grievances, appeals and claim
disputes, the requirements and timeframes for filing grievances, appeals and
claim disputes, the availability of assistance in the filing process, the
toll-free numbers that the enrollee can use to file a grievance or appeal by
phone, that benefits will continue when requested by the enrollee in an appeal
or state fair hearing request concerning certain actions which are timely filed,
that the enrollee may be required to pay the cost of services furnished during
the appeal/hearing process if the final decision is adverse to the enrollee, and
that a provider may file an appeal on behalf of an enrollee with the enrollee's
written consent. Information to enrollees must meet cultural competency and
limited English proficiency requirements as specified in Section D, Paragraph
18, Member Information, and Paragraph 20, Cultural Competency.

The Contractor shall be responsible to provide the necessary professional,
paraprofessional and clerical services for the representation of the Contractor
in all issues relating to the grievance system and any other matters arising
under this contract which rise to the level of administrative hearing or a
judicial proceeding. Unless there is an agreement with the State in advance, the
Contractor shall be responsible for all attorney fees and costs awarded to the
claimant in a judicial proceeding.

26. QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE SYSTEM REPORTS

ENROLLEE APPEAL AND PROVIDER CLAIM DISPUTE REPORT: The Contractor must submit
the Enrollee Appeal and Provider Claim Dispute Report to AHCCCSA, Division of
Health Care Management, using the Quarterly Grievance System Report Format, no
later than 45 days from the end of each quarter.

ENROLLEE GRIEVANCE REPORT: The Contractor must accept, resolve and track
enrollee grievances as required in the ACOM Enrollee Grievance Policy. The
Contractor must submit the Enrollee Grievance Report no later than 45 days from
the end of each quarter. The report must include the following:

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Report A. and B. above by the current quarter, prior quarter and current quarter
for the previous year.

The Contractor shall trend and analyze grievance, appeals and claim disputes at
least quarterly; any identified trends and corrective action plans should be
reported to AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care Management.

27.  NETWORK DEVELOPMENT

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is designed to
support a medical home for members and sufficient to provide all covered
services to AHCCCS members [42 CFR 438.206(b)(1)]. It shall ensure covered
services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in terms of
location and hours of operation. [42 CFR 438.206(c)(l)(i) and (ii)]There shall
be sufficient personnel for the provision of covered services, including
emergency medical care on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis [42 CFR
438.206(c)(l)(iii). The proposed network shall be sufficient to provide covered
services within designated time and distance limits. For Maricopa and Pima
Counties only, this includes a network such that 95% of its members residing
within the boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson do not have to
travel more than 5 miles to see a PCP, dentist or pharmacy. PCPs and specialists
who provide inpatient services to the Contractor's members shall have admitting
and treatment privileges in a minimum of one general acute care hospital within
the Contractor's service area. Hospitalists may satisfy this requirement.
Contractors in Maricopa and/or Pima counties must have at least one hospital
contract in each of the service districts specified in Attachment B.

Contractors must provide a comprehensive provider network that ensures its
membership has access at least equal to, or better than, community norms.
Services shall be as accessible to AHCCCS members in terms of timeliness,
amount, duration and scope as those services are to non-AHCCCS persons within
the same service area [42 CFR 438.210(a)(2)]. The Contractor is expected to
consider the full spectrum of care when developing its network. The Contractor
must also consider communities whose residents typically receive care in
neighboring states. If the Contractor is unable to provide those services
locally, it must so demonstrate to AHCCCSA and shall provide reasonable
alternatives for members to access care. These alternatives must be approved by
AHCCCSA. If the Contractor's network is unable to provide medically necessary
services required under contract, the Contractor must adequately and timely
cover these services through an out of network provider until a network provider
is contracted. The Contractor and out of network provider must coordinate with
respect to authorization and payment issues in these circumstances. [42 CFR
438.206(b)(4) and (5)]

The Contractor is also encouraged to develop non-financial incentive programs to
increase participation in its provider network.

AHCCCS is committed to workforce development and support of the medical
residency and dental student training programs in the state of Arizona. Working
proactively with these programs is beneficial to protect their viability, and
also provides an excellent opportunity for the Contractors to educate future
providers on the principles of managed care. In addition, AHCCCS believes that
these programs can influence the provider capacity issues in Arizona. In the
future, AHCCCS would like to provide incentives to those programs that are
working to retain physicians in Arizona after completion of the program.

AHCCCS encourages plans to work with the many residency programs currently
operating in the state and to investigate opportunities for resident
participation in contractor medical management and committee activities. If any
Contractor or Contractors enter into the Graduate Medical Education Memorandum
of Understanding with a residency program and assign members to it, AHCCCSA may
increase the auto-assignment algorithm to favor those Contractors.

The Contractor shall not discriminate with respect to participation in the
AHCCCS program, reimbursement or indemnification against any provider based
solely on the provider's type of licensure or certification [42 CFR
438.12(a)(l)]. In addition, the Contractor must not discriminate against
particular providers that service high-risk populations or specialize in
conditions that require costly treatment [42 CFR 438.214(c)]. This provision,
however, does not prohibit the Contractor from limiting provider participation
to the extent necessary to meet the


                                      -45-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

needs of the Contractor's members. This provision also does not interfere with
measures established by the Contractor to control costs consistent with its
responsibilities under this contract [42 CFR 438.12(b)(1)]. If a Contractor
declines to include individual or groups of providers in its network, it must
give the affected providers written notice of the reason for its decision [42
CFR 438.12(a)(l)]. The Contractor may not include providers excluded from
participation in Federal health care programs, under either section 1128 or
section 1128A of the Social Security Act [42 CFR 438.214(d)].

See Attachment B, Minimum Network Requirements, for details on network
requirements by Geographic Service Area.

PROVIDER NETWORK DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT PLAN: The Contractor shall develop
and maintain a provider network development and management plan, which ensures
that the provision of covered services will occur as stated above. [42 CFR
438.207(b)] This plan shall be updated annually and submitted to AHCCCSA,
Division of Health Care Management, 45 days from the start of each contract
year. The plan shall identify the methodology used by the Contractor to
determine a geographically appropriate distribution of medical disciplines for
primary care, obstetrical care and individual medical specialties for its
membership. The plan shall also contain a description of the Contractor's
criteria used to determine the numbers and kinds of PCP providers and of
specialists, and whether hospital privileges are considered when making this
determination. A similar description should be included for the dental and
pharmacy networks and for the adequacy of non-emergency transportation services.
The plan shall identify the current status of the Contractor's network, and
project future needs based upon, at a minimum, membership growth; the number and
types (in terms of training, experience and specialization) of providers that
exist in the Contractor's service area, as well as the number of physicians who
have privileges with and practice in hospitals; the expected utilization of
service, given the characteristics of its population and its health care needs;
the numbers of providers not accepting new Medicaid patients; and access of its
membership to specialty services as compared to the general population of the
community. [42 CFR 438.206(b)(1)] The plan, at a minimum, shall also include the
following:

     a.   Current network gaps and the methodology used to identify them;

     b.   Immediate short-term interventions when a gap occurs, including
          expedited or temporary credentialing;

     c.   Interventions to fill network gaps and barriers to those
          interventions;

     d.   Outcome measures/evaluation of interventions;

     e.   Ongoing activities for network development;

     f.   Coordination between internal departments;

     g.   Coordination with outside organizations;

     h.   A description of network design by GSA for the general population,
          including details regarding special populations including, but not
          limited to, the developmentally delayed (Arizona Early Intervention
         Program (AzEIP), the homeless and those in border communities.

          The description should cover:

               i.   how members access the system

               ii.  relationships between various levels of the system

               iii. the plan for incorporating the medical home for members and
                    the progress in its implementation

     i.   A description of the adequacy of the geographic access to tertiary
          hospital services for the Contractor's membership.

     j.   The assistance provided to PCPs when they refer members to
          specialists. The methods used to communicate the availability of this
          assistance to the providers.

     k.   The methodology (ies) the Contractor uses to collect and analyze
          provider feedback about the network designs and implementation. When
          specific provider issues are identified, the protocols for handling
          them.

The plan must include answers to the following questions:


                                      -46-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

     a.   How does the Contractor assess the medical and social needs of new
          members to determine how the contractor may assist the member in
          navigating the network more efficiently?

     b.   What assistance is provided to members with a high severity of illness
          or higher utilization to better navigate the provider network?

     c.   Does the Contractor utilize any of the following strategies to reduce
          unnecessary emergency department utilization by the membership? If so,
          how are members educated about these options?

               i.   Physician coverage/call availability after-hours and on
                    weekends

               ii.  Same-day PCP appointments

               iii. Nurse call-in centers/information lines

               iv.  Urgent Care facilities

     d.   Are members with special health care needs assigned to specialists for
          their primary care needs?

     e.   What are the most significant barriers to efficient network deployment
          within the Contractor's service area? How can AHCCCS best support the
          Contractor's efforts to improve its network and the quality of care
          delivered to its membership?

28. PROVIDER AFFILIATION TRANSMISSION

The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its provider
network. This information shall be submitted in the format described in the
Provider Affiliation Transmission User Manual on October 15, January 15, April
15, and July 15 of each contract year. The manual may be found in the Bidder's
Library. If the provider affiliation transmission is not timely, accurate and
complete, the Contractor may be required to submit a corrective action plan and
may be subject to sanction.

29. NETWORK MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that pertain to all
service specifications described in the AMPM. In addition, the Contractor shall
have policies on how the Contractor will [42 CFR 438.214(a)]:

a.   Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/or program changes
     and requirements;

b.   Monitor network compliance with policies and rules of AHCCCSA and the
     Contractor, including compliance with all policies and procedures related
     to the grievance process and ensuring the member's care is not compromised
     during the grievance process;

c.   Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network;

d.   Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services should the
     network become temporarily insufficient within the contracted service area;

e.   Monitor the adequacy, accessibility and availability of its provider
     network to meet the needs of its members, including the provision of care
     to members with limited proficiency in English;

f.   Process expedited and temporary credentials;

g.   Recruit, select, credential, re-credential and contract with providers in a
     manner that incorporate quality management, utilization, office audits and
     provider profiling; and

h.   Provide training for its providers and maintain records of such training.

Contractor policies shall be subject to approval by AHCCCSA, Division of Health
Care Management, and shall be monitored through operational audits. A material
change in Contractor policy or process requires 30 days advance notice to
affected providers and members. A material change is defined as any change in
overall business practice that could have an impact on 5% or more of the
members, providers, or AHCCCS program, or may significantly impact the delivery
of services provided by an AHCCCS Contractor. Contractors are required to submit
the member notices to AHCCCS for approval 30 days prior to the notice being
sent. Upon receipt of the member notice for review, AHCCCSA may comment on the
material change or may intervene if the policy/process change will have an
adverse affect to the overall system.

Provider notices do not require prior approval, however, the Contractor must
notify AHCCCSA of the material policy change 15 days prior to the provider
notice being sent out. During the 15 day time period, AHCCCS


                                      -47-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

shall have the right to comment or may intervene if the change to policy/process
will lead to an adverse affect to the overall system. This provision is not
intended to include contract negotiations between Contractors and providers.

Contractors shall give hospitals and physician groups 90 days notice prior to a
contract termination without cause. Contracts between the Contractor and single
practitioners are exempt from this requirement.

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care Management [42 CFR 438.207(c)]. A
material change is defined as one which affects, or can reasonably be foreseen
to affect, the Contractor's ability to meet the performance and network
standards as described in this contract. AHCCCSA will assess proposed changes in
the Contractor's provider network for potential impact on members' health care
and provide a written response to the Contractor. For emergency situations,
AHCCCSA will expedite the approval process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care Management, within
one business day of any unexpected changes that would impair its provider
network. This notification shall include (1) information about how the change
will affect the delivery of covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for
maintaining the quality of member care, if the provider network change is likely
to affect the delivery of covered services.

30. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall include in its provider network a sufficient number of PCPs
to meet the requirements of this contract. Health care providers designated by
the Contractor as PCPs shall be licensed in Arizona as allopathic or osteopathic
physicians who generally specialize in family practice, internal medicine,
obstetrics, gynecology, or pediatrics; certified nurse practitioners or
certified nurse midwifes; or physician's assistants. [42 CFR 438.206(b)(2)]

The Contractor shall assess the PCP's ability to meet AHCCCS appointment
availability and other standards when determining the appropriate number of its
members to be assigned to a PCP. The Contractor should also consider the PCP's
total panel size (i.e. AHCCCS and non-AHCCCS patients) when making this
determination. AHCCCS members shall not comprise the majority of a PCP's panel
of patients. AHCCCSA shall inform the Contractor when a PCP has a panel of more
than 1,800 AHCCCS members (assigned by a single Contractor or multiple
Contractors), to assist in the assessment of the size of their panel. This
information will be provided on a quarterly basis. The Contractor will adjust
the size of a PCP's panel, as needed, for the PCP to meet AHCCCS appointment and
clinical performance standards.

The Contractor shall have a system in place to monitor and ensure that each
member is assigned to an individual PCP and that the Contractor's data regarding
PCP assignments is current. The Contractor is encouraged to assign members with
complex medical conditions, who are age 12 and younger, to board certified
pediatricians. PCP's, with assigned members diagnosed with AIDS or as HIV
positive, shall meet criteria and standards set forth in the AMPM.

To the extent required by this contract, the Contractor shall offer members
freedom of choice within its network in selecting a PCP [42 CFR 438.6(m) and
438.52(d)]. The Contractor may restrict this choice when a member has shown an
inability to form a relationship with a PCP, as evidenced by frequent changes,
or when there is a medically necessary reason. When a new member has been
assigned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall inform the member in writing of
his enrollment and of his PCP assignment within 10 days of the Contractor's
receipt of notification of assignment by AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall include
with the enrollment notification a list of all the Contractor's available PCPs,
the process for changing the PCP assignment, should the member desire to do so,
as well as the information required in the ACOM Member Information Policy. The
Contractor shall confirm any PCP change in writing to the member. Members may
make both their initial PCP selection and any subsequent PCP changes either
verbally or in writing.


                                      -48-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

At a minimum, the Contractor shall hold the PCP responsible for the following
activities [42 CFR 438.208(b)(l)]:

a.   Supervision, coordination and provision of care to each assigned member;

b.   Initiation of referrals for medically necessary specialty care;

c.   Maintaining continuity of care for each assigned member; and

d.   Maintaining the member's medical record, including documentation of all
     services provided to the member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or
     referral services. Services potentially requiring medical follow up are the
     only dental services whose documentation must be included in the medical
     record.

The Contractor shall establish and implement policies and procedures to monitor
PCP activities and to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of, and receive
documentation regarding, specialty and referral services provided to assigned
members by specialty physicians, and other health care professionals. Contractor
policies and procedures shall be subject to approval by AHCCCSA, Division of
Health Care Management, and shall be monitored through operational audits.

Contractors will work with AHCCCSA to develop a methodology to reimburse clinics
for the homeless and school based clinics. AHCCCSA and Contractors will identify
coordination of care processes and reimbursement mechanisms. The Contractor will
be responsible for payment of these services directly to the clinics.

31. MATERNITY CARE PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is designated for
each pregnant member for the duration of her pregnancy and postpartum care and
that maternity services are provided in accordance with the AMPM. The Contractor
may include in its provider network the following maternity care providers:

a.   Arizona licensed allopathic and/or osteopathic physicians who are general
     practitioners or specialize in family practice or obstetrics

b.   Physician Assistants

c.   Nurse Practitioners

d.   Certified Nurse Midwives

Pregnant members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetrical
care. Such assignment shall be consistent with the freedom of choice
requirements for selecting health care professionals while ensuring that the
continuity of care is not compromised. Members who choose to receive maternity
services from a licensed midwife shall also be assigned to a PCP for medical
care, as primary care is not within the scope of practice for licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform deliveries shall have OB
hospital privileges or a documented hospital coverage agreement for those
practitioners performing deliveries in alternate settings. Licensed midwives
perform deliveries only in the member's home. Labor and delivery services may
also be provided in the member's home by physicians, certified nurse
practitioners and certified nurse midwives who include such services within
their practice.

32. REFERRAL MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have adequate written procedures regarding referrals to
specialists, to include, at a minimum, the following:

a.   Use of referral forms clearly identifying the Contractor


                                      -49-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

b.   A system for resolving disputes regarding the referrals

c.   PCP referral shall be required for specialty physician services, except
     that women shall have direct access to in-network GYN providers, including
     physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners within the scope
     of their practice, without a referral for preventive and routine services
     [42 CFR 438.206(b)(2)]. In addition, for members with special health care
     needs determined to need a specialized course of treatment or regular care
     monitoring, the Contractor must have a mechanism in place to allow such
     members to directly access a specialist (for example through a standing
     referral or an approved number of visits) as appropriate for the member's
     condition and identified needs. Any waiver of this requirement by the
     Contractor must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA.

d.   Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment for a medical
     condition other than that for which the member was referred, unless
     approved by the member's PCP.

e.   A process in place that ensures the member's PCP receives all specialist
     and consulting reports and a process to ensure PCP follow-up of all
     referrals including EPSDT referrals for behavioral health services

f.   A referral plan for any member who is about to lose eligibility and who
     requests information on low-cost or no-cost health care services

g.   Referral to Medicare HMO including payment of copayments

h.   Allow for a second opinion from a qualified health care professional within
     the network, or if one is not available in network, arrange for the member
     to obtain one outside the network, at no cost to the member [42 CFR
     438.206(b)(3)].

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable physician referral requirements
and conditions defined in Sections 1903(s) and 1877 of the Social Security Act.
Upon finalization of the regulations, the Contractor shall comply with all
applicable physician referral requirements and conditions defined in 42 CFR Part
411, Part 424, Part 435 and Part 455. Sections 1903(s) and 1877 of the Act
prohibits physicians from making referrals for designated health services to
health care entities with which the physician or a member of the physician's
family has a financial relationship. Designated health services include:

     a.   Clinical laboratory services

     b.   Physical therapy services

     c.   Occupational therapy services

     d.   Radiology services

     e.   Radiation therapy services and supplies

     f.   Durable medical equipment and supplies

     g.   Parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment and supplies

     h.   Prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies

     i.   Home health services

     j.   Outpatient prescription drugs

     k.   Inpatient and outpatient hospital services

33. APPOINTMENT STANDARDS

For purposes of this section, "urgent" is defined as an acute, but not
necessarily life-threatening disorder, which, if not attended to, could endanger
the patient's health. The Contractor shall have procedures in place that ensure
the following standards are met:

a.   Emergency PCP appointments - same day of request

b.   Urgent care PCP appointments - within 2 days of request

c.   Routine care PCP appointments - within 21 days of request

For specialty referrals, the Contractor shall be able to provide:

c.   Third trimester - within 3 days of request

d.   High risk pregnancies - within 3 days of identification of high risk by the
     Contractor or maternity care provider, or immediately if an emergency
     exists

If a member needs non-emergent medically necessary transportation, the
Contractor shall require its transportation provider to schedule the
transportation so that the member arrives on time for the appointment, but no
sooner than one hour before the appointment; does not have to wait more than one
hour after making the call to be picked up; nor have to wait for more than one
hour after conclusion of the appointment for transportation home.

The Contractor shall actively monitor the adequacy of its appointment processes
and reduce the unnecessary use of alternative methods such as emergency room
visits [42 CFR 438.206(c)(1)(i)]. The Contractor shall actively monitor and
ensure that a member's waiting time for a scheduled appointment at the PCP's or
specialist's office is no more than 45 minutes, except when the provider is
unavailable due to an emergency.

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures about educating its
provider network regarding appointment time requirements. The Contractor must
assign a specific staff member or unit within its organization to monitor
compliance with appointment standards. The Contractor must develop a corrective
action plan when appointment standards are not met; if appropriate, the
corrective action plan should be developed in conjunction with the provider [42
CFR 438.206(c)(1)(iv), (v) and (vi)]. Appointment standards shall be included in
the Provider Manual. The Contractor is encouraged to include the standards in
the provider subcontract.

34. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC) AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS (RHC)

The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs/RHCs in Arizona to provide covered
services and must comply with the Federal mandates. AHCCCS expects the
contractors to negotiate rates of payment with FQHCs/RHCs for non-pharmacy
services that are comparable to the rates paid to providers that provide similar
services.

Contractors are required to submit member information for Title XIX members for
each FQHC/RHC on a quarterly basis to the AHCCCSA Division of Health Care
Management. AHCCCSA will perform periodic audits of the member information
submitted. Contractors should refer to the AHCCCS Division of Health Care
Management's policy on FQHC/RHC reimbursement for further guidance. The
FQHCs/RHCs registered with AHCCCS are listed on the AHCCCS website
(www.azahcccs.gov).

u.   Formulary information, including updates when changes occur, must be
     provided in advance to providers, including pharmacies. The Contractor is
     not required to send a hard copy, unless requested, of the formulary each
     time it is updated. A memo may be used to notify providers of updates and
     changes, and refer providers to view the updated formulary on the
     Contractor's website.

v.   AHCCCS appointment standards

w.   Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements and Title VI, as
     applicable

x.   Eligibility verification

36. PROVIDER REGISTRATION

The Contractor shall ensure that all of its subcontractors register with AHCCCSA
as an approved service provider and receive an AHCCCS Provider ID Number. A
Provider Participation Agreement must be signed by each provider who does not
already have a current AHCCCS ID number. The original shall be forwarded to


                                      -52-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

AHCCCSA. This provider registration process must be completed in order for the
Contractor to report services a subcontractor renders to enrolled members and
for the Contractor to be paid reinsurance.

37. SUBCONTRACTS

The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract performance whether or
not subcontracts are used [42 CFR 438.230(a) and 434.6(c)]. No subcontract shall
operate to terminate the legal responsibility of the Contractor to assure that
all activities carried out by the subcontractor conform to the provisions of
this contract. Subject to such conditions, any function required to be provided
by the Contractor pursuant to this contract may be subcontracted to a qualified
person or organization. All such subcontracts must be in writing [42 CFR
438.6(L)]. See the ACOM Contractor Claims Processing by Health Plan
Subcontracted Providers Policy.

All subcontracts entered into by the Contractor are subject to prior review and
written approval by AHCCCS, Division of Health Care Management, and shall
incorporate by reference the terms and conditions of this contract. The
following subcontracts, unless otherwise specified, shall be submitted to
AHCCCS, Division of Health Care Management for prior approval at least 30 days
prior to the beginning date of the subcontract:

a.   Automated data processing

b.   Third-party administrators

c.   Management Services (See also Section D, Paragraph 43)

d.   Capitated or other risk subcontracts requiring claims processing by the
     subcontractor

The Contractor shall maintain a fully executed original of all subcontracts,
which shall be accessible to AHCCCSA within two business days of request by
AHCCCSA. All requested subcontracts must have full disclosure of all terms and
conditions and must fully disclose all financial or other requested information.
Information may be designated as confidential but may not be withheld from
AHCCCS as proprietary. Information designated as confidential may not be
disclosed by AHCCCS without the prior written consent of the Contractor except
as required by law. All subcontracts shall comply with the applicable provisions
of Federal and State laws, regulations and policies.

Before entering into a subcontract which delegates Contractor duties or
responsibilities to a subcontractor, the Contractor must evaluate the
prospective subcontractor's ability to perform the activities to be delegated.
If the Contractor delegates duties or responsibilities such as utilization
management or claims processing to a subcontractor, then the Contractor shall
establish a written agreement that specifies the activities and reporting
responsibilities delegated to the subcontractor. The written agreement shall
also provide for revoking delegation or imposing other sanctions if the
subcontractor's performance is inadequate. In order to determine adequate
performance, the Contractor shall monitor the subcontractor's performance on an
ongoing basis and subject it to formal review according to a periodic schedule.
The schedule for review shall be submitted to AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care
Management for prior approval. As a result of the performance review, any
deficiencies must be communicated to the subcontractor in order to establish a
corrective action plan. The results of the performance review and the correction
plan shall be communicated to AHCCCS upon completion. [42 CFR 438.230(b)]

The Contractor must submit annually (within 90 days from the start of the
contract year) a statement whether any Contractor duties or responsibilities
have been delegated to a subcontractor. If duties or responsibilities have been
delegated to a subcontractor, the Contractor must submit annually (within 90
days from the start of the contract year) a report listing the following:

     -    Subcontractor's name

     -    Delegated duties and responsibilities

     -    Most recent review date of the duties, responsibilities and financial
          position of the subcontractor

     -    Next scheduled review date

     -    Identified areas of deficiency

     -    Contractor's corrective action plan

The Contractor shall promptly inform AHCCCS, Division of Health Care Management,
in writing if a subcontractor is in significant non-compliance that would affect
their abilities to perform the duties and responsibilities of the subcontract.

The Contractor shall not include covenant-not-to-compete requirements in its
provider agreements. Specifically, the Contractor shall not contract with a
provider and require that the provider not provide services for any other AHCCCS
Contractor. In addition, except for cost sharing requirements, the Contractor
shall not enter into subcontracts that contain compensation terms that
discourage providers from serving any specific eligibility category.

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any provider (including
out-of-state providers) the Contractor reasonably anticipates will be providing
services on its behalf more than 25 times during the contract year [42
CFR 438.206(b)(1)]. Exceptions to this requirement include the following:

a.   If a provider who provides services more than 25 times during the contract
     year refuses to enter into a written agreement with the Contractor, the
     Contractor shall submit documentation of such refusal to AHCCCS, Division
     of Health Care Management within seven days of its final attempt to gain
     such agreement.

b.   If a provider performs emergency services such as an emergency room
     physician or an ambulance company, a written agreement is not required.

c.   Individual providers as detailed in the AMPM.

d.   Hospitals, as discussed in Section D, Paragraph 40, Hospital Subcontracting
     and Reimbursement.

e.   If a provider primarily performs services in an inpatient setting.

f.   If upon the Medical Director's review, it is determined that the Contractor
     or members would not benefit by adding the provider to the contracted
     network.

Any other exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AHCCCS, Division of
Health Care Management. If AHCCCS does not respond within 30 days, the requested
exception is deemed approved. The Contractor may request an expedited review and
approval.

Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the provisions of Attachment A,
Minimum Subcontract Provisions. In addition, each subcontract must contain the
following [42 CFR 438.206(b)(l)]:

a.   Full disclosure of the method and amount of compensation or other
     consideration to be received by the subcontractor.

b.   Identification of the name and address of the subcontractor.

c.   Identification of the population, to include patient capacity, to be
     covered by the subcontractor.

d.   The amount, duration and scope of medical services to be provided, and for
     which compensation will be paid.

e.   The term of the subcontract including beginning and ending dates, methods
     of extension, termination and re-negotiation.

f.   The specific duties of the subcontractor relating to coordination of
     benefits and determination of third-party liability.

g.   A provision that the subcontractor agrees to identify Medicare and other
     third-party liability coverage and to seek such Medicare or third party
     liability payment before submitting claims to the Contractor.

h.   A description of the subcontractor's patient, medical and cost record
     keeping system.

i.   Specification that the subcontractor shall cooperate with quality
     management/quality improvement programs, and comply with the utilization
     management and review procedures specified in 42 CFR Part 456, as specified
     in the AMPM.

j.   A provision stating that a merger, reorganization or change in ownership of
     a subcontractor that is related to or affiliated with the Contractor shall
     require a contract amendment and prior approval of AHCCCSA.

k.   Procedures for enrollment or re-enrollment of the covered population (may
     also refer to the Provider Manual).

l.   A provision that the subcontractor shall be fully responsible for all tax
     obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all other applicable
     insurance coverage obligations which arise under this subcontract, for
     itself and its employees, and that AHCCCSA shall have no responsibility or
     liability for any such taxes or insurance coverage.

m.   A provision that the subcontractor must obtain any necessary authorization
     from the Contractor or AHCCCSA for services provided to eligible and/or
     enrolled members.

n.   A provision that the subcontractor must comply with encounter reporting and
     claims submission requirements as described in the subcontract.

o.   Provision(s) that allow the Contractor to suspend, deny, refuse to renew or
     terminate any subcontractor in accordance with the terms of this contract
     and applicable law and regulation.

p.   A provision that the subcontractor may provide the member with factual
     information, but is prohibited from recommending or steering a member in
     the member's selection of a Contractor.

q.   A provision that compensation to individuals or entities that conduct
     utilization management activities is not structured so as to provide
     incentives for the individual or entity to deny, limit or discontinue
     medically necessary services to any enrollee (42 CFR 438.210(e)).

38. CLAIMS PAYMENT/HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system capable of
processing, cost avoiding and paying claims in accordance with A.R.S. Sections
36-2903 and 2904 and Article 7 of the AHCCCS rules, a copy of which may be found
in the Bidder's Library.

The Contractor's claims payment system, as well as its prior authorization and
concurrent review process, must minimize the likelihood of having to recoup
already-paid claims. Any individual recoupment in excess of $50,000 per provider
within a contract year must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA, Division of
Health Care Management, Acute Finance Unit. If AHCCCS does not respond within 30
days, the recoupment request is deemed approved. AHCCCS must be notified of any
cumulative recoupment greater than $50,000 per provider per contract year. A
Contractor shall not recoup monies from a provider later than 12 months after
the date of original payment on a clean claim, without prior approval from
AHCCCSA, unless the recoupment is a result of fraud, reinsurance audit findings,
data validation or audits conducted by the AHCCCSA Office of Program Integrity.

The Contractor is required to reimburse providers for previously recouped monies
if the provider was subsequently denied payment by the primary insurer based on
timely filing limits or lack of prior authorization and the member failed to
disclose additional insurance coverage other than AHCCCS.

Unless a subcontract specifies otherwise, Contractors with 50,000 or more
members shall ensure that 95% of all clean claims are paid within 30 days of
receipt of the clean claim and 99% are paid within 60 days of receipt of the
clean claim. Unless a subcontract specifies otherwise, Contractors with fewer
than 50,000 members shall ensure that 90% of all clean claims are paid within 30
days of receipt of the clean claim and 99% are paid within 60 days of receipt of
the clean claim. Additionally, unless a shorter time period is specified in
contract, the Contractor shall not pay a claim initially submitted more than 6
months after date of service or pay a clean claim submitted more than 12 months
after date of service. Claim payment requirements pertain to both contracted and
non-contracted providers. The receipt date of the claim is the date stamp on the
claim or the date electronically received. The receipt date is the day the claim
is received at the Contractor's specified claim mailing address. The paid date
of the claim is the date on the check or other form of payment. [42 CFR
447.45(d)] Claims submission deadlines shall be calculated from the date of
service or the effective date of eligibility posting, whichever is later.
Remittance advices accompanying the Contractor's payments to providers must
contain, at a minimum, adequate descriptions of all denials and adjustments, the
reasons for such denials and adjustments, the amount billed, the amount paid,
and provider rights for claim dispute.


                                      -55-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Effective for all non-hospital clean claims with dates of service October 1,
2004 and thereafter, in the absence of a contract specifying other late payment
terms, Contractors are required to pay interest on late payments. Late claims
payments are those that are paid after 45 days of receipt of the clean claim (as
defined in this contract). In grievance situations, interest shall be paid back
to the date interest would have started to accrue beyond the applicable 45 day
requirement. Interest shall be at the rate often per cent per annum, unless a
different rate is stated in a written contract. In the absence of interest
payment terms in a subcontract, interest shall accrue starting on the first day
after a clean claim is contracted to be paid. For hospital clean claims, a slow
payment penalty shall be paid in accordance with A.R.S. 2903.01. When interest
is paid, the Contractor must report the interest separately from the health plan
paid amount on the encounter. Interest should be reported in the 837 CAS
adjustment loop using reason code "85".

Contractors are required to accept HIPAA compliant electronic claims
transactions from any provider interested and capable of electronic submission;
and must be able to make claims payments via electronic funds transfer. In
addition, Contractors shall implement and meet the following milestone in order
to make claims processing and payment more efficient and timely:

     -    Receive and pay 50% of all claims (based on volume of actual claims
          excluding claims processed by Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs))
          electronically by July 1, 2006

The Contractor shall submit a monthly Claims Dashboard as specified in the
AHCCCS Claims Reporting Guide. The Monthly report must be received by the
AHCCCSA, Division of Healthcare Management, no later than 15 days from the end
of each month.

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a health information system that
collects, analyzes, integrates, and reports data. The system shall provide
information on areas including, but not limited to, service utilization, claim
disputes and appeals. [42 CFR 438.242(a)]

The Contractor will ensure that changing or making major upgrades to the
information systems effecting claims processing, or any other major business
component, will be accompanied by a plan which includes a timeline, milestones,
and adequate testing before implementation. At least six months before the
anticipated implementation date, the contractor shall provide the system change
plan to AHCCCSA for review and comment.

39. SPECIALTY CONTRACTS

AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the Contractor and
AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical services. AHCCCSA will consider
existing Contractor resources in the development and execution of specialty
contracts. AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contracts. Specialty contracts shall
take precedence over, and supersede, existing and future subcontracts for
services that are subject to specialty contracts. AHCCCSA may consider waiving
this requirement in particular situations if such action is determined to be in
the best interest of the State; however, in no case shall reimbursement exceed
that payable under the relevant AHCCCSA specialty contract.

During the term of specialty contracts, AHCCCSA may act as an intermediary
between the Contractor and specialty contractors to enhance the cost
effectiveness of service delivery. Adjudication of claims related to such
payments provided under specialty contracts shall remain the responsibility of
the Contractor. AHCCCSA may provide technical assistance prior to the
implementation of any specialty contracts.

Currently, AHCCCSA only has specialty contracts for transplant services and
anti-hemophilic agents and related pharmaceutical services. AHCCCSA shall
provide at least 60 days advance written notice to the Contractor prior to the
implementation of any specialty contract.

40. HOSPITAL SUBCONTRACTING AND REIMBURSEMENT

MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTIES ONLY: Effective October 1, 2003, legislation
authorizes the Inpatient Hospital Reimbursement Program (Program). The Program
is defined in the Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) 36-2905.01, and requires
hospital subcontracts to be negotiated between contractors and hospitals in
Maricopa and Pima counties to establish reimbursement levels, terms and
conditions. Subcontracts shall be negotiated by the Contractor and hospitals to
cover operational concerns, such as timeliness of claims submission and payment,
payment of discounts or penalties and legal resolution which may, as an option,
include establishing arbitration procedures. These negotiated subcontracts shall
remain under close scrutiny by AHCCCSA to ensure availability of quality
services within specific service districts, equity of related party interests
and reasonableness of rates. The general provisions of this program encompass
acute care hospital services and outpatient hospital services that result in an
admission. The Contractor shall submit all hospital subcontracts and any
amendments to AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care Management. For non-emergency
patient-days, the Contractor shall ensure that at least 65% of its members use
contracted hospitals. AHCCCSA reserves the right to subsequently adjust the 65%
standard. Further, if in AHCCCSA's judgment the number of emergency days at a
particular non-contracted hospital becomes significant, AHCCCSA may require a
subcontract at that hospital. In accordance with R9-22-718, unless otherwise
negotiated by both parties, the reimbursement for inpatient services provided at
a non-contracted hospital shall be based on the rates as defined in A.R.S.
Section 36-2903.01, multiplied by 95%.

ALL COUNTIES EXCEPT MARICOPA AND PIMA: The Contractor shall reimburse hospitals
for member care in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. The Contractor is
encouraged to obtain subcontracts with hospitals in all GSA's and must submit
copies of these subcontracts, including amendments, to AHCCCSA, Division of
Health Care Management.

OUT-OF-STATE HOSPITALS: The Contractor shall reimburse out-of-state hospitals in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. Contractors serving border communities
(excluding Mexico) are strongly encouraged to establish contractual agreements
with those out-of-state hospitals that are identified by GSA in Attachment B.

OUTPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES: With passage of SB 1410 (Laws of 2004, Chapter
279), effective for dates of service on and after July 1, 2005, in absence of a
contract, the default payment rate for outpatient hospital services billed on a
UB-92 will be based on the AHCCCS outpatient hospital fee schedule, rather than
a hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio (pursuant to ARS 36-2904).

HOSPITAL RECOUPMENTS: The Contractor may conduct prepayment and post-payment
medical reviews of all hospital claims including outlier claims. Erroneously
paid claims are subject to recoupment. If the Contractor fails to identify lack
of medical necessity through concurrent review and/or prepayment medical review,
lack of medical necessity identified during post-payment medical review shall
not constitute a basis for recoupment by the Contractor. This prohibition does
not apply to recoupments that are a result of an AHCCCS reinsurance audit. See
also Section D, Paragraph 38, Claims Payment System. For a more complete
description of the guidelines for hospital reimbursement, please consult the
Bidder's Library for applicable statutes and rules.

41. NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the nursing facility
is unable to obtain prior authorization in situations where acute care
eligibility and ALTCS eligibility overlap and the member is enrolled with an
AHCCCS acute care contractor. In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements. The Contractor's payment responsibility,
described above, applies only in situations where the nursing facility has not
been notified in advance of the member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care
contractor. When ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute care enrollment, the
acute care enrollment takes precedence. Although the member could be ALTCS
eligible for this time period, there is no ALTCS enrollment that occurs on the
same days as AHCCCS acute enrollment.

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

The Contractor shall provide medically necessary nursing facility services for
any member who has a pending ALTCS application, who is currently residing in a
nursing facility and is eligible for services provided under this contract. If
the member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS Contractor
before the end of the maximum 90 days per contract year of nursing facility
coverage, the Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility coverage
during the time the member is enrolled with the Contractor. Nursing facility
services, covered by a third party insurer (including Medicare) while the member
is enrolled with the Contractor, shall be applied to the 90 day per contract
year limitation.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application process and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the
stay goes beyond the 90-day per contract year maximum.

42. PHYSICIAN INCENTIVES/PAY FOR PERFORMANCE

Physician Incentives

Reporting of Physician Incentive Plans has been suspended by CMS until further
notice. No reporting is required until suspension is lifted.

The Contractor must comply with all applicable physician incentive requirements
and conditions defined in 42 CFR 417.479. These regulations prohibit physician
incentive plans that directly or indirectly make payments to a doctor or a group
as an inducement to limit or refuse medically necessary services to a member.
The Contractor is required to disclose all physician incentive agreements to
AHCCCSA and to AHCCCS members who request them.

The Contractor shall not enter into contractual arrangements that place
providers at significant financial risk as defined in CFR 417.479 unless
specifically approved in advance by the AHCCCSA Division of Health Care
Management. In order to obtain approval, the following must be submitted to the
AHCCCSA Division of Health Care Management 45 days prior to the implementation
of the contract [42 CFR 438.6(g)]:

1.   A complete copy of the contract

2.   A plan for the member satisfaction survey

3.   Details of the stop-loss protection provided

4.   A summary of the compensation arrangement that meets the substantial
     financial risk definition.

The Contractor shall disclose to AHCCCSA the information on physician incentive
plans listed in 42 CFR 417.479(h)(l) through 417.479(I) upon contract renewal,
prior to initiation of a new contract, or upon request from AHCCCSA or CMS.
Please refer to the Physician Incentive Plan Disclosure by Contractors Policy in
the Bidder's Library for details on providing required disclosures.

The Contractor shall also provide for compliance with physician incentive plan
requirements as set forth in 42 CFR 422.208, 422.210 and 438.6(h). These
regulations apply to contract arrangements with subcontracted entities that
provide utilization management services.

Pay for Performance Any pay for performance that meets the requirements of 42
CFR 417.479 must be approved by AHCCCS Division of Health Care Management prior
to implementation.

43. MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT AND COST ALLOCATION PLAN

If a Contractor has subcontracted for management services, the management
service agreement and the corporate cost allocation plan must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care Management. The cost allocation plan
must be submitted with the proposed management fee agreement. AHCCCSA reserves
the


                                      -58-

right to perform a thorough review of actual management fees charged and/or
corporate allocations made. If the fees or allocations actually paid out are
determined to be unjustified or excessive, amounts may be subject to repayment
to the Contractor. In addition, sanctions may be imposed.

44. RESERVED

45. MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered for a contract award, the Offeror must meet a minimum
capitalization requirement for each GSA bid. The capitalization requirement for
both new and continuing offerors must be met within 30 days after contract
award. [42 CFR 438.116]

</TABLE>

*    Yavapai's minimum capitalization requirement for both new and existing
     offerors is limited to $150 times the estimated number of members.

NEW OFFERORS: To be considered for a contract award in a given GSA or group of
GSA's, a new offeror must meet the minimum capitalization requirements listed
above. The capitalization requirement is subject to a $10,000,000 ceiling
regardless of the number of GSA's awarded. This requirement is in addition to
the Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 46 and 47 below and must
be met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a loan subject to repayment. The
capitalization requirement may be applied toward meeting the equity per member
requirement (see Section D, Paragraph 50, Financial Viability
Standards/Performance Guidelines) and is intended for use in operations of the
Contractor.

CONTINUING OFFERORS: Continuing offerors that are bidding a county or GSA in
which they currently have a contract must meet the equity per member standard
(see Section D, Paragraph 50, Financial Viability Standards/Performance
Guidelines) for their current membership. Continuing offerors that do not meet
the equity standard must fund, through capital contribution, the necessary
amount to meet the minimum capitalization requirement. Continuing offerors that
are bidding a new GSA must provide the additional capitalization for the new GSA
they are bidding. The amount of the required capitalization for continuing
offers may differ from that for new offerors due to size of the existing
offerors current enrollment. (See the table of requirements by GSA above).

Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional capitalization if
they currently meet the equity per member standard with their existing
membership and their excess equity is sufficient to cover the proposed
additional members, or they have at least $10,000,000 in equity.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

46. PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE

The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of standard
commercial scope issued by a surety company doing business in this State, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit ("Performance Bond") to AHCCCSA
for as long as the Contractor has AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000 or more
outstanding, or 15 months following the effective date of this contract,
whichever is later, to guarantee: (1) payment of the Contractor's obligations to
providers, non-contracting providers, and non-providers; and (2) performance by
the Contractor of its obligations under this contract [42 CFR 438.116(a)(l) and
(b)(l)]. The Performance Bond shall be in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA as
described in the ACOM Performance Bond Policy available in the Bidder's Library.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in addition to any
other remedies it may have under this contract, obtain payment under the
Performance Bond or substitute security for the purposes of the following:

a.   Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting providers and
     non-providers by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under
     this contract,

b.   Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on behalf of the
     Contractor, and

c.   Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative expenses incurred
     by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under this contract,
     including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after termination of this
     contract for reasons other than the convenience of the State by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu of the
Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit, the Contractor
agrees to execute any and all documents and perform any and all acts necessary
to secure and enforce AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and necessary UCC filings
pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code. In the event such substitute
security is agreed to and accepted by AHCCCSA, the Contractor acknowledges that
it has granted AHCCCSA a security interest in such substitute security to secure
performance of its obligations under this contract. The Contractor is solely
responsible for establishing the credit-worthiness of all forms of substitute
security. AHCCCSA may, after written notice to the Contractor, withdraw its
permission for substitute security, in which case the Contractor shall provide
AHCCCSA with a form of security described above. The Contractor may not change
the amount, duration or scope of the performance bond without prior written
approval from AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care Management

The Contractor shall not leverage the bond for another loan or create other
creditors using the bond as security.

47. AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND

The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 80% of the total
capitation payment expected to be paid to the Contractor in the first month of
the contract year, or as determined by AHCCCSA. The total capitation amount
shall include delivery and hospital supplemental payments. This requirement must
be satisfied by the Contractor no later than 30 days after notification by
AHCCCSA of the amount required. Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the
enrollment statistics of the Contractor on a monthly basis to determine if the
Performance Bond must be increased. The Contractor shall have 30 days following
notification by AHCCCSA to increase the amount of the Performance Bond. The
Performance Bond amount that must be maintained after the contract term shall be
sufficient to cover all outstanding liabilities and will be determined by
AHCCCSA. The Contractor may not change the amount of the performance bond
without prior written approval from AHCCCS, Division of Health Care Management.
Refer to the ACOM Performance Bond and Equity Per Member Policy for more
details.

48. ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT

The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund deficit through
capital contributions in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA within 30 days after
receipt by AHCCCSA of the final audited financial statements, or as otherwise
requested by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in any
or all GSA's as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if unaudited.

49. ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS

The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA, make any
advances to a related party or subcontractor. The Contractor shall not, without
similar prior approval, make any distribution, loan or loan guarantee to any
entity, including another fund or line of business within its organization. All
investments, other than investments in U.S. Government securities or
Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA prior approval. (See the Reporting
Guide for Acute Care Contractors for alternatives to the prior approval of
individual investments.) All requests for prior approval are to be submitted to
the AHCCCSA Division of Health Care Management.

50. FINANCIAL VIABILITY STANDARDS / PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES

AHCCCSA has established financial viability standards/performance guidelines. On
a quarterly basis, AHCCCSA will review the following ratios with the purpose of
monitoring the financial health of the Contractor. The two financial viability
standards, the Current Ratio and Equity per Member, are the standards that best
represent the financial solvency of the Contractor. Therefore, the Contractor
must comply with these two financial viability standards.

AHCCCSA will also monitor the Medical Expense Ratio, the Administrative Cost
Percentage, and the RBUC's Days Outstanding. These guidelines are analyzed as
part of AHCCCSA's due diligence in financial statement monitoring. Sanctions may
not be imposed if the Contractor does not meet these performance guidelines.
AHCCCSA takes into account Contractors' unique programs for managing care and
improving the heath status of members when analyzing medical expense and
administrative ratio results. However, if a critical combination of the
Financial Viability Standards and Performance Guidelines are not met, or if a
Contractor's experience differs significantly from other Contractors',
additional monitoring, such as monthly reporting, may be required.

                                 parent company, the parent company must have
                                 liquid assets that support the amount of the
                                 intercompany loan.

51. SEPARATE INCORPORATION

Within 60 days of contract award, a non-governmental contractor shall have
established a separate corporation for the purposes of this contract, whose sole
activity is the performance of contract function with AHCCCS.

52. MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the Contractor shall
require prior approval of AHCCCSA and a subsequent contract amendment. The
Contractor must submit a detailed merger, reorganization and/or transition plan
to AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care Management, for review. The purpose of the
plan review is to ensure uninterrupted services to members, evaluate the new
entity's ability to support the provider network, ensure that services to
members are not diminished and that major components of the organization and
AHCCCS programs are not adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or
change in ownership.

53. COMPENSATION

The method of compensation under this contract will be Prior Period Coverage
(PPC) capitation, prospective capitation, delivery supplement, hospitalized
supplement for Medical Expense Deduction (MED) members, HIV-AIDS supplement,
reinsurance and third party liability, as described and defined within this
contract and appropriate laws, regulations or policies.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Actuaries establish the capitation rates using practices established by the
Actuarial Standards Board. AHCCCS provides the following data to its actuaries
to establish rates for the purposes of rebasing the capitation rates.

     a.   Utilization and unit cost data derived from reported encounters

     b.   Both Audited and unaudited financial statements reported by
          Contractors

     c.   Local market basket inflation trends

     d.   AHCCCS fee for service schedule pricing adjustments

     e.   Programmatic or Medicaid covered service changes that affect
          reimbursement

     f.   Additional administrative requirements for Contractors

     g.   Other changes to medical practices that affect reimbursement

AHCCCS adjusts its rates to best match payment to risk. This further ensures the
actuarial basis for die capitation rates. The following risk factors will be
included:

     a.   Reinsurance (as described in Paragraph 57)

     b.   HIV/AIDS supplemental payment

     c.   Age/Gender for the 1931(b), SOBRA, KidsCare and BCCTP eligibility
          groups

     d.   Medicare enrollment for SSI members

     e.   Delivery supplemental payment

     f.   Hospitalized supplemental payments for MED members

     g.   Geographic Service Area adjustments

     h.   Risk sharing for Title XIX Waiver Group reimbursement

     i.   Risk sharing for PPC reimbursement

     j.   Member choice statistic for Title XIX Waiver Group

     k.   Member share of cost amounts

The above information is reviewed by AHCCCS' actuaries in renewal years to
determine if adjustments are necessary to maintain actuarially sound rates. A
Contractor may cover services for members that are not covered under the State
Plan; however those services are not included in the data provided to actuaries
for setting capitation rates [42 CFR 438.6(e)]. In addition to the above data
used to review the appropriateness of capitation rates, during renewal years,
AHCCCS may look at other factors that potentially impact appropriate
reimbursement including the medical cost experience of members who exercise
their right to choose a contractor upon initial enrollment versus those who are
auto assigned to a contractor.

PROSPECTIVE CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation for all
prospective member months, including partial member months. This capitation
includes the cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members
during the prospective period coverage.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE (PPC) CAPITATION: Except for SOBRA Family Planning,
KidsCare and HIFA Parents, the Contractor will be paid capitation for all PPC
member months, including partial member months. This capitation includes the
cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members during prior
period coverage. The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA and will be
paid to the Contractor along with the prospective capitation described below.
Contractors will not receive PPC capitation for newborns of members who were
enrolled at the time of delivery.

RECONCILIATION OF PPC COSTS TO REIMBURSEMENT: AHCCCSA will reconcile the
Contractor's PPC medical cost expenses to PPC capitation paid to the Contractor
during the year. This reconciliation will limit the Contractor's profits and
losses to 2%. Any losses in excess of 2% will be reimbursed to the Contractor,
and likewise, profits in excess of 2% will be recouped. Encounter data will be
used to determine medical expenses. Refer to the ACOM PPC Reconciliation Policy
for further details.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

RISK SHARING FOR TITTLE XIX WAIVER MEMBERS: AHCCCSA will reconcile the
Contractor's PPC and prospective medical cost expenses to PPC capitation,
prospective capitation, hospitalized supplemental payments, delivery
supplemental payments and HIV/AIDS supplemental payments paid to the Contractor
during the year. This reconciliation will limit the Contractor's profits and
losses to 2%. Any losses in excess of 2% will be reimbursed to the Contractor,
and likewise, profits in excess of 2% will be recouped. Encounter data will be
used to determine medical expenses. Refer to the ACOM Title XIX Waiver
Reconciliation Policy for further details.

DELIVERY SUPPLEMENT: When the Contractor has an enrolled woman who delivers
during a prospective enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a
supplemental payment. Supplemental payments will not apply to women who deliver
in a prior period coverage time period. AHCCCSA reserves the right at any time
during the term of this contract to adjust the amount of this payment for women
who deliver at home. The delivery supplemental payment is not made if the
hospitalized supplemental payment has already been paid.

HOSPITALIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT: If an MED member is an inpatient on the date
of application for AHCCCS eligibility, and the date of application falls within
the member's eligibility period, the Contractor is entitled to a supplemental
payment to help defray costs related to the inpatient stay. The payment is a
one-time supplement that is paid when the member is enrolled with the Contractor
and is subject to review during the term of the contract.

HIV-AIDS SUPPLEMENT: On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall submit to
AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care Management, an unduplicated monthly count of
members, by rate code, who are using approved HIV/AIDS drugs along with the
supporting pharmacy log. The report shall be submitted, along with the quarterly
financial reporting package, within 60 days after the end of each quarter.
AHCCCSA reserves the right to recoup any amounts paid for ineligible members as
well as an associated penalty for incorrect encounter reporting. The approved
HIV/AIDS drug list is located on the AHCCCS website at www.azahcccs.gov.

Refer to the ACOM Contractor HIV/AIDS Supplemental Payments Policy for further
details and requirements.

54. PAYMENTS TO CONTRACTORS

Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments to the
Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contract provided that the
Contractor's performance is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
contract. Payment must comply with requirements of A.R.S. Title 36. AHCCCSA
reserves the option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or National
Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) transfer and will provide the
Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the effective date of any such
change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA shall not be
liable for any error or delay in transfer or indirect or consequential damages
arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or
expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by
the Contractor. Except for adjustments made to correct errors in payment, and as
otherwise specified in this section, any savings remaining to the Contractor as
a result of favorable claims experience and efficiencies in service delivery at
the end of the contract term may be kept by the Contractor.

All funds received by the Contractor pursuant to this contract shall be
separately accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Except for funds received from the collection of permitted copayments and
third-party liabilities, the only source of payment to the Contractor for the
services provided hereunder is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System
Fund. An error discovered by the State, with or without an audit, in the amount
of fees paid to the Contractor will be subject to adjustment or repayment by
AHCCCSA making a corresponding decrease in a

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

current Contractor's payment or by making an additional payment to the
Contractor. When a contractor identifies an overpayment, AHCCCSA must be
notified and reimbursed within 30 days of identification.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned or pledged by the
Contractor. This section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole option from
making payment to a fiscal agent hired by Contractor.

55. CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS

Except for changes made specifically in accordance with this contract, the rates
set forth in Section B shall not be subject to re-negotiation or modification
during the contract period. AHCCCSA may, at its option, review the effect of a
program change and determine if a capitation adjustment is needed. In these
instances the adjustment will be prospective with assumptions discussed with the
Contractor prior to modifying capitation rates. The Contractor may request a
review of a program change if it believes the program change was not equitable;
AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a review.

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance of any
obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option and in addition to
other available remedies, adjust the amount of payment until there is
satisfactory resolution of the default. The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA
and/or AHCCCSA may deduct from future monthly capitation for any portion of a
month during which the Contractor was not at risk due to, for example:

a.   death of a member

b.   member's incarceration (not eligible for AHCCCS benefits from the date of
     incarceration)

c.   duplicate capitation to the same Contractor

d.   adjustment based on change in member's contract type

e.   voluntary withdrawal

If a member is enrolled twice with the same Contractor, recoupment will be made
as soon as the double capitation is identified. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
modify its policy on capitation recoupments at any time during the term of this
contract.

56. INCENTIVES

AHCCCSA will be implementing an incentive program that utilizes financial and/or
non-financial incentives to promote program quality. AHCCCSA will use contractor
clinical performance indicators in the development of an incentive program.
Examples of incentive programs are listed below.

AUTO ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM: Effective CYE '06, AHCCCSA will adjust the auto
assignment algorithm methodology to incorporate contractor's clinical
performance indicator results in the calculation of target percentages. AHCCCSA
will use the following performance indicators:

          Prenatal Care in the First Trimester
          Well-Child Visits 3-6 Years

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Effective CYE '06, AHCCCSA may elect to reduce
Operational Financial Review (OFR) requirements for high performing contractors.

USE OF WEBSITE: Contractors will be required to post their clinical performance
indicators compared to AHCCCS standard and statewide averages on their website.
In addition, AHCCCSA will post contractor performance indicators on its website.

57. REINSURANCE

Reinsurance is a stop-loss program provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the
partial reimbursement of covered services, as described below, for a member with
an acute medical condition beyond an annual deductible level. AHCCCSA
"self-insures" the reinsurance program through a deduction to capitation rates
that is intended to be budget neutral. Refer to the AHCCCSA Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual for further details on the Reinsurance Program.

INPATIENT REINSURANCE

Inpatient reinsurance covers partial reimbursement of covered inpatient facility
medical services. See the table below for applicable deductible levels and
coinsurance percentages. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA
will reimburse the Contractor for covered inpatient services incurred above the
deductible. The deductible is the responsibility of the Contractor. Per diem
rates paid for nursing facility services provided within 30 days of an acute
hospital stay, including room and board, provided in lieu of hospitalization for
up to 90 days in any contract year shall be eligible for reinsurance coverage.

The following table represents deductible and coinsurance levels:

*    applies to all members except for Title XIX Waiver Group members

A) PROSPECTIVE REINSURANCE: This coverage applies to prospective enrollment
periods. The deductible level is based on the Contractor's statewide AHCCCS
acute care enrollment (not including SOBRA Family Planning Extension services)
as of October 1st each contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown
in the table above. AHCCCSA will adjust the Contractor's deductible level at the
beginning of a contract year if the Contractor's enrollment changes to the next
enrollment level. A Contractor at the $35,000 or $50,000 deductible level may
elect a lower deductible prior to the beginning of a new contract year. These
deductible levels are subject to change by AHCCCSA during the term of this
contract. Any change will have a corresponding impact on capitation rates.

B) PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE REINSURANCE: Effective October 1, 2003, AHCCCSA will no
longer cover PPC inpatient expenses under the reinsurance program for any
members except Title XIX Waiver Group members. See section c) below for
additional information.

C) TITLE XIX WAIVER MEMBERS: A separate reinsurance deductible for the Title XIX
Waiver Group applies for both the prospective and prior period coverage time
periods. There can only be one reinsurance case for prior period and prospective
enrollment.

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE

The reinsurance program includes a special Catastrophic Reinsurance program.
This program encompasses members diagnosed with hemophilia, von Willebrand's
Disease, and Gaucher's Disease. For additional detail and restrictions refer to
the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual and the AMPM. There are no
deductibles for catastrophic reinsurance cases. All medically necessary covered
services provided during


                                      -66-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

the contract year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the AHCCCS
allowed amount or the Contractor's paid amount, depending on subcap code.
Reinsurance coverage for anti-hemophilic blood factors will be limited to 85% of
the AHCCCS contracted amount or the Contractor's paid amount, whichever is
lower. Capitation rates may be adjusted to reflect any cost savings resulting
from the implementation of the AHCCCS anti-hemophilic blood factor contract. All
catastrophic claims are subject to medical review by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care Management,
Reinsurance Unit, of cases identified for catastrophic reinsurance coverage
within 30 days of (a) initial diagnosis, (b) enrollment with the Contractor, and
(c) the beginning of each contract year. Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid
for a maximum 30-day retroactive period from the date of notification to
AHCCCSA. The determination of whether a case or type of case is catastrophic
shall be made by the Director or designee based on the following criteria; 1)
severity of medical condition, including prognosis; and 2) the average cost or
average length of hospitalization and medical care, or both, in Arizona, for the
type of case under consideration.

HEMOPHILIA: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all members
diagnosed with Hemophilia (ICD9 codes 286.0, 286.1, 286.2).

VON WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for
all members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDAVP responders
and dependent on Plasma Factor VIII.

GAUCHER'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance is available for members diagnosed
with Gaucher's Disease classified as Type I and are dependent on enzyme
replacement therapy.

TRANSPLANTS

This program covers members who are eligible to receive covered major organ and
tissue transplantation including bone marrow, heart, heart/lung, lung, liver,
kidney, and other organ transplantation. Bone grafts and cornea transplantation
services are not eligible for transplant reinsurance coverage but are eligible
under the regular inpatient reinsurance program. Refer to the AMPM for covered
services for organ and tissue transplants. Reinsurance coverage for transplants
is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the transplantation services
rendered, or 85% of the Contractor's paid amount, whichever is lower. The AHCCCS
contracted transplantation rates may be found in the Bidder's Library. When a
member is referred to a transplant facility for an AHCCCS-covered organ
transplant, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care
Management.

OTHER

For all reinsurance case types other than transplants, Contractors will be
reimbursed 100% for all medically necessary covered expenses provided in a
contract year, after the reinsurance case reaches $650,000. Transplant case
types have another risk limitation methodology described in the AHCCCSA
Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual.

ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION AND PAYMENTS FOR REINSURANCE

A) ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION: A Contractor shall prepare, review, verify, certify,
and submit, encounters for consideration to AHCCCSA. Upon submission, the
Contractor certifies that the services listed were actually rendered. The
encounters must be submitted in the format prescribed by AHCCCSA. The Contractor
must initiate and evaluate an encounter for probable 1st and 3rd party liability
before submitting the encounter for reinsurance consideration, unless the
encounter involves underinsured or uninsured motorist liability insurance, 1st
and 3rd party liability insurance or a tort feasor.


                                      -67-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

The Contractor must maintain evidence that costs incurred have been paid by the
Contractor before submitting reinsurance encounters. This information is subject
to AHCCCSA review. Collections from lst and 3rd parties should be reflected by
the Contractor as reductions in the encounters submitted on a dollar-for-dollar
basis. For purposes of AHCCCSA reinsurance, payments made by
Contractor-purchased reinsurance are not considered lst and 3rd party
collections.

All reinsurance claims must reach a clean claim status within fifteen months
from the end date of service, or date of eligibility posting, whichever is
later. Encounters for reinsurance claims that have passed the fifteen month
deadline and are being adjusted due to a claim dispute or hearing decision must
be submitted within 90 calendar days of the date of the claim dispute or hearing
decision. Failure to submit the encounter within this timeframe will result in
the loss of any related reinsurance dollars.

B) ENCOUNTER PROCESSING: AHCCCSA will accept for processing only those
encounters that are submitted directly by an AHCCCS Contractor and that comply
with the AHCCCSA Encounter Reporting User Manual

C) PAYMENT OF INPATIENT AND CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE CASES: AHCCCSA will
reimburse a Contractor for costs incurred in excess of the applicable deductible
level, subject to coinsurance percentages. Amounts in excess of the deductible
level shall be paid based upon costs paid by the Contractor, minus the
coinsurance unless the costs are paid under a subcapitated arrangement. In
subcapitated arrangements, the Administration shall base reimbursement of
reinsurance encounters on the lower of the AHCCCS allowed amount or the reported
health plan paid amount, minus the coinsurance and Medicare/TPL payment and
applicable quick pay discounts.

Reimbursement for these reinsurance benefits will be made to the Contractor each
month. AHCCCSA will also provide a reconciliation of reinsurance payments in the
case where encounters used in the calculation of reinsurance benefits are
subsequently adjusted or voided.

When a member with an annual enrollment choice changes Contractors within a
contract year, for reinsurance purposes, all eligible inpatient costs, nursing
facility costs and inpatient psychiatric costs incurred for that member will
follow the member to the receiving contractor. Therefore, all submitted
encounters from the contractor the member is leaving (for dates of service
within the current contract year) will be applied toward, but not exceed, the
receiving contractor's deductible level. For further details regarding this
policy and other reinsurance policies refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual.

D) PAYMENT OF TRANSPLANT REINSURANCE CASES: Reinsurance benefits are based upon
the lower of the AHCCCS contract amount or the Contractor's paid amount, subject
to coinsurance percentages. Effective for dates of service on or after October
1, 2004, Contractors are required to submit all supporting service encounters
for transplant services. Reinsurance payments will be linked to transplant
encounter submissions. Please refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing
Manual for the appropriate billing of transplant services. Reimbursement for
these reinsurance benefits will be made to the Contractor each month.

REINSURANCE AUDITS

PRE-AUDIT: Medical audits on prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance
cases will be determined based on statistically valid retrospective random
sampling or on targeted cases/encounters selected based on utilization trend
information. For closed contracts, a 100% audit may be conducted. AHCCCSA,
Division of Health Care Management, Reinsurance Unit, will generate the cases
and/or encounters selected and will notify the Contractor of documentation
needed for the medical audit process to occur. The Reinsurance Unit may select
cases based on encounter data received during the existing contract year to
ensure timeliness of the audit process.

AUDIT: AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least 45 days advance notice of any
audit. The Contractor shall have all requested medical records and financial
documentation available to the nurse auditors. Any


                                      -68-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

documents not requested in advance by AHCCCSA shall be made available upon
request of the Audit Team during the course of the audit. The Contractor
representative shall be available to the Audit Team at all times during AHCCCSA
audit activities. If an audit should be conducted on-site, the Contractor shall
provide the Audit Team with workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets
and privacy for conferences.

Audits may be completed without an on-site visit. For these audits, the
Contractor will be asked to send the required documentation to AHCCCSA. The
documentation will then be reviewed by AHCCCS.

AUDIT CONSIDERATIONS: Reinsurance consideration will be given to inpatient
facility contracts and hearing decisions rendered by the Office of Legal
Assistance. Pre-hearing and/or hearing penalties discoverable during the review
process will not be reimbursed under reinsurance.

Per diem rates may be paid for nursing facility and rehabilitation services
provided the services are rendered within 30 days of an acute hospital stay,
including room and board, provided in lieu of hospitalization for up to 90 days
in any contract year. The services rendered in these sub-acute settings must be
of an acute nature and, in the case of rehabilitative or restorative services,
steady progress must be documented in the medical record.

AUDIT DETERMINATIONS: The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Reinsurance
Post-Audit Results letter approximately 45 days after the audit and given an
opportunity to comment and provide additional medical or financial documentation
on any audit findings. AHCCCSA may limit reinsurance reimbursement to a lower
or alternative level of care if the Director or designee determines that the
less costly alternative could and should have been used by the Contractor. A
recoupment of reinsurance reimbursements made to the Contractor may occur based
on the results of the medical audit.

A Contractor whose reinsurance case is reduced or denied shall be notified in
writing by AHCCCSA and will be informed of rationale for reduction or denial
determination and the applicable grievance and appeal process available.

58. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS / THIRD PARTY LIABILITY

Pursuant to federal and state law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort. This
means AHCCCSA shall be used as a source of payment for covered services only
after all other sources of payment have been exhausted. The Contractor shall
coordinate benefits in accordance with 42 CFR 433.135 et seq., ARS 36-2903, and
A.A.C. R9-22-1001 et seq. so that costs for services otherwise payable by the
Contractor are cost avoided or recovered from a liable first or third-party
payer. The Contractor may require subcontractors to be responsible for
coordination of benefits for services provided pursuant to this contract.

Members with CRS condition: A member with private insurance is not required to
utilize CRSA. If the member uses the private insurance network for a CRS covered
condition, the Contractor is responsible for all applicable deductibles and
copayments. When the private insurance is exhausted with respect to CRS covered
conditions, the Contractor shall refer the member to CRSA for determination for
CRS services.

The two methods used in the coordination of benefits are cost avoidance and post
payment recovery. The Contractor shall use these methods as described in A.A.C.
R9-22-1001 et seq. and federal and state law. See also Section D, Paragraph 60,
Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.

COST AVOIDANCE: The Contractor shall take reasonable measures to determine the
legal liability of third parties who are liable to pay for covered services. The
Contractor shall cost-avoid a claim if it establishes the probable existence of
a third party or has information that establishes that third party liability
exists. However, if the probable existence of third party liability cannot be
established or third party liability benefits are not available to pay the claim
at the time the claim is filed, the Contractor must process the claim.


                                      -69-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

If a third party insurer (other than Medicare) requires the member to pay any
co-payment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is responsible for making
these payments, even if the services are provided outside of the Contractor
network. The Contractor is not responsible for paying coinsurance and
deductibles that are in excess of what the Contractor would have paid for the
entire service per a written contract with the provider performing the service,
or the AHCCCS FFS payment equivalent. The Contractor must decide whether it is
more cost-effective to provide the service within its network or pay coinsurance
and deductibles for a service outside its network. For continuity of care, the
Contractor may also choose to provide the service within its network. If the
Contractor refers the member for services to a third-party insurer, other than
Medicare, and the insurer requires payment in advance of all co-payments,
coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must make such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will not pay the claim for
a covered service due to untimely claim filing or as a result of the underlying
insurance coverage (e.g. the service is not a covered benefit), the Contractor
shall not deny the service, deny payment of the claim based on third party
liability, or require a written denial letter if the service is medically
necessary. The Contractor shall communicate any known change in health insurance
information, including Medicare, to AHCCCS Administration, Division of Member
Services, not later than 10 days from the date of discovery using the approved
AHCCCS correspondence. Failure to report these cases may result in one of the
remedies specified in Section D, Paragraph 72, Sanctions. If the Contractor does
not know whether a particular service is covered by the third party, and the
service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall contact the third party and
determine whether or not such service is covered rather than requiring the
member to do so. In the event that the service is not covered by the third
party, the Contractor shall arrange for the timely provision of the service.
(See also Section D, Paragraph 60, Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.)

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered services. For
prenatal care and preventive pediatric services, AHCCCS may require the
Contractor to provide such service and then coordinate payment with the
potentially liable third party ("pay and chase"). In emergencies, the Contractor
shall provide the necessary services and then coordinate payment with the
third-party payer. The Contractor shall also provide medically necessary
transportation so the member can receive medical benefits. Further, if a service
is medically necessary, the Contractor shall ensure that its cost avoidance
efforts do not prevent a member from receiving such service and that the member
shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles for use of the other
insurer's providers.

POST-PAYMENT RECOVERIES: Post-payment recovery is necessary in cases where the
Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost-avoid. The Contractor shall
identify, through the use of trauma code edits, utilizing diagnostic codes 799.9
and 800 to 999.9 (excluding code 994.6), and other procedures. The Contractor
shall notify AHCCCSA's authorized representative within 10 business days of the
identification of a third-party liability case with reinsurance or fee-for
service payments made by AHCCCS. Failure to report these cases may result in one
of the remedies specified in Section D, Paragraph 72, Sanctions. The Contractor
shall identify all potentially liable third parties and pursue reimbursement
from them except in the circumstances below.

The Contractor shall not pursue reimbursement in the following circumstances,
unless the case has been referred to the Contractor by AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA's
authorized representative:

Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance
First-and third-party liability insurance
Tortfeasors, including casualty
Special Treatment Trust Recovery
Restitution Recovery
Worker's Compensation
Estate Recovery

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above circumstances to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the Contractor identify such a
situation. The Contractor shall cooperate with AHCCCSA's authorized
representative in all collection efforts. In joint cases involving both AHCCCS
fee-


                                      -70-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

for-service or reinsurance and the Contractor, AHCCCSA's authorized
representative is responsible for performing all research, investigation and
payment of lien-related costs, subsequent to the referral of any and all
relevant case information to AHCCCSA's authorized representative by the
Contractor. AHCCCSA's authorized representative is also responsible for
negotiating and acting in the best interest of all parties to obtain a
reasonable settlement in joint cases and may compromise a settlement in order to
maximize overall reimbursement, net of legal and other costs. The Contractor
will be responsible for their prorated share of the contingency fee. The
Contractor's share of the contingency fee will be deducted from the settlement
proceeds prior to AHCCCSA remitting the settlement to the Contractor. For total
plan cases involving only payments made by the Contractor, the Contractor is
responsible for performing all research, investigation, the mandatory filing of
initial liens on cases that exceed $250, lien amendments, lien releases, and
payment of other related costs in accordance with A.R.S. 36-2915 and A.R.S.
36-2916. The Contractor shall use the AHCCCS approved casualty recovery
correspondence when filing liens and when corresponding to others in regard to
casualty recovery. The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party
collections if all of the following conditions exist:

     a.   Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the
          Contractor's financial liability for the member;

     b.   There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-service,
          reinsurance or administrative costs (i.e. lien filing, etc.); and

     c.   Such recovery is not prohibited by state or Federal law.

REPORTING: The Contractor may be required to report the amount of third-party
collections and cost avoidance. In addition, upon AHCCCSA's request, the
Contractor shall provide an electronic extract of the Casualty cases, including
open and closed cases. Data elements include, but are not limited to: the
member's first and last name; AHCCCS ID; date of incident; claimed amount;
paid/recovered amount; and case status. The AHCCCSA TPL Section shall provide
the format and reporting schedule for this information to the Contractor. Prior
to negotiating a settlement on a total plan case, the Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA to ensure that there is no reinsurance or fee for service payments that
have been made by AHCCCS. For total plan cases, the contractor shall report
settlement information to AHCCCS, utilizing the AHCCCS approved casualty
recovery Notification of Settlement form, within 10 business days from the
settlement date. Failure to report these cases may result in one of the remedies
specified in Section D, Paragraph 72, Sanctions.

AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, on an agreed upon schedule, with a complete
file of all third-party coverage information (other than Medicare) for the
purpose of updating the Contractor's files. The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA
of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format prescribed by
AHCCCSA.

TITLE XXI (KIDSCARE), HIFA PARENTS AND BCCTP: Eligibility for KidsCare, HIFA
Parents and BCCTP benefits require that the applicant/member not be enrolled
with any other creditable health insurance plan. If the Contractor becomes aware
of any such coverage, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA immediately. AHCCCSA
will determine if the other insurance meets the creditable definition in A.R.S.
36-2982(G).

CONTRACT TERMINATION: Upon termination of this contract, the Contractor will
complete the existing third party liability cases or make any necessary
arrangements to transfer the cases to AHCCCSA's authorized TPL representative.

59.  COPAYMENTS

Most of the AHCCCS members remain exempt from repayments while others are
subject to an optional copayment. Those populations exempt or subject to
optional copayments may not be denied services for the inability to pay the
copayment. [42 CFR 438.108]

Any copayments collected shall belong to the Contractor or its subcontractors.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP No. YH04-0001

Attachment L provides detail of the populations and their related copayment
structure.

60.  MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING

AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.
These members are referred to as "dual eligibles". Generally, Contractors are
responsible for payment of Medicare coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered
services provided to dual eligible members. However, there are different cost
sharing responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a variety
of factors. Unless prior approval is obtained from AHCCCSA, the Contractor must
limit their cost sharing responsibility according to the ACOM Medicare Cost
Sharing Policy. The Contractor shall have no cost sharing obligation if the
Medicare payment exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same
service of a non-Medicare member.

61.  MARKETING

The Contractor shall submit all proposed marketing and outreach materials and
events that will involve the general public to the AHCCCS Marketing Committee
for prior approval in accordance with the ACOM Marketing Outreach and Incentives
Policy. [42 CFR 438.104] The Contractor must have signed contracts with PCPs,
specialists, dentists, and pharmacies in order for them to be included in
marketing materials.

62.  CORPORATE COMPLIANCE

In accordance with A.R.S. Section 36-2918.01, all contractors are required to
notify the AHCCCS, Office of Program Integrity (OPI) immediately of all
suspected fraud or abuse. The Contractor agrees to promptly (within ten business
days of discovery) inform OPI in writing of instances of suspected fraud or
abuse [42 CFR 455.1(a)(l)]. This shall include acts of suspected fraud or abuse
that were resolved internally but involved AHCCCS funds, contractors or
sub-contractors.

As stated in A.R.S. Section 13-2310, incorporated herein by reference, any
person who knowingly obtains any benefit by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, promises, or material omissions is guilty of a Class
2 felony.

The Contractor agrees to permit and cooperate with any onsite review. A review
by AHCCCS, OPI may be conducted without notice and for the purpose of ensuring
program compliance. The Contractor also agrees to respond to electronic,
telephonic or written requests for information within the timeframe specified by
AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall be in compliance with 42 CFR 438.608. The Contractor must
have a mandatory compliance program, supported by other administrative
procedures, that is designed to guard against fraud and abuse. The Contractor
shall have written criteria for selecting a Compliance Officer and a job
description that clearly outlines the responsibilities and the authority of the
position. The Compliance Officer shall have the authority to access records and
independently refer suspected member fraud, provider fraud and member abuse
cases to AHCCCS, OPI or other duly authorized enforcement agencies.

The compliance program, which shall both prevent and detect suspected fraud or
abuse, must include:

     1.   Written policies, procedures, and standards of conduct that articulate
          the organization's commitment to and processes for complying with all
          applicable federal and state standards.

     2.   The written designation of a compliance committee who are accountable
          to the Contractor's top management.


                                      -72-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

     3.   The Compliance Officer must be an onsite management official who
          reports directly to the Contractor's top management. Any exceptions
          must be approved by AHCCCSA.

     4.   Effective training and education.

     5.   Effective lines of communication between the compliance officer and
          the organization's employees.

     6.   Enforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary
          guidelines.

     7.   Provision for internal monitoring and auditing.

     8.   Provision for prompt response to problems detected.

     9.   A Compliance Committee which will be made up of, at a minimum, the
          Compliance Officer, a budgetary official and other executive officials
          with the authority to commit resources. The Compliance Committee will
          assist the Compliance Officer with monitoring, reviewing and assessing
          the effectiveness of the compliance program and timeliness of
          compliance reporting.

The Contractor is required to research potential overpayments identified by
AHCCCS, OPI. After conducting a cost benefit analysis to determine if such
action is warranted, the Contractor should attempt to recover any overpayments
identified. The AHCCCS OPI shall be advised of the final disposition of the
research and advised of actions, if any, taken by the Contractor.

63. RECORDS RETENTION

The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to covered services and
expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA and working papers used in the
preparation of reports to AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall comply with all
specifications for record keeping established by AHCCCSA. All books and records
shall be maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS Rules
and policies. Records shall include but not be limited to financial statements,
records relating to the quality of care, medical records, prescription files and
other records specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available, at all reasonable times during the term
of this contract, any of its records for inspection, audit or reproduction by
any authorized representative of AHCCCSA, State or Federal government. The
Contractor shall be responsible for any costs associated with the reproduction
of requested information.

The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for a period of
five years from the date of final payment under this contract. HIPAA related
documents must be retained for a period of six years per 45 CFR 164.530(j).

If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records relating to
the work terminated shall be preserved and made available for a period of five
years from the date of any such termination. Records which relate to grievances,
disputes, litigation or the settlement of claims arising out of the performance
of this contract, or costs and expenses of this contract to which exception has
been taken by AHCCCSA, shall be retained by the Contractor for a period of five
years after the date of final disposition or resolution thereof.

64. DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA relating to the
information requirements of this contract and as required to support the data
elements to be provided AHCCCSA in the formats prescribed by AHCCCSA and in
formats prescribed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA). Details for the formats may be found in the draft HIPAA Transaction
Companion Documents & Trading Partner Agreements, and in the AHCCCS Technical
Interface Guidelines, available in the Bidder's Library.

The information so recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance with
all procedures, policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the term of this
contract. If any of these procedures, policies, rules, regulations


                                      -73-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

or statutes are hereinafter changed both parties agree to conform to these
changes following appropriate notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed submission or
payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors), and/or penalty applied due to
any error, omission, deletion, or erroneous insert caused by
Contractor-submitted data. Any data that does not meet the standards required by
AHCCCSA shall not be accepted by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies immediately
upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA. If any unreported inconsistencies are
subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall be responsible for the necessary
adjustments to correct its records at its own expense.

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of eligibility and
enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange. Upon request by
AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP
assignments in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange.

The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific security code for
use in all data transmissions made in accordance with contract requirements.
Each data transmission by the Contractor shall include the Contractor's security
code. The Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it certifies that
any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best of the Contractor's
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or designee's knowledge [42 CFR
438.606]. The Contractor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the State
of Arizona and AHCCCSA from any and all claims or liabilities, including but not
limited to consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings and
reimbursements of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any error,
omission, deletion or erroneous insert caused by the Contractor in the submitted
input data. Neither the State of Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be responsible for
any incorrect or delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS services providers
(subcontractors) resulting from such error, omission, deletion, or erroneous
input data caused by the Contractor in the submission of AHCCCS claims.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative costs paid to the
Contractor. There is no separate payment for software changes. A PMMIS systems
contact will be assigned after contract award. AHCCCSA will work with the
contractors as they evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.

HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA): The Contractor
shall comply with the Administrative Simplification requirements of Subpart F of
the HIPAA of 1996 (Public Law 107-191, 110 Statutes 1936) and all Federal
regulations implementing that Subpart that are applicable to the operations of
the Contractor by the dates required by the implementing Federal regulations.

65. ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success of
the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA uses encounter data to pay reinsurance benefits, set
fee-for-service and capitation rates, determine disproportionate share payments
to hospitals, and to determine compliance with performance standards. The
Contractor shall submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all services for which the
Contractor incurred a financial liability and claims for services eligible for
processing by the Contractor where no financial liability was incurred,
including services provided during prior period coverage. This requirement is a
condition of the CMS grant award. [42 CFR 438.242(b)(l)]

A Contractor shall prepare, review, verify, certify, and submit, encounters for
consideration to AHCCCSA. Upon submission, the Contractor certifies that the
services listed were actually rendered [42 CFR 455.1(a)(2)]. The encounters must
be submitted in the format prescribed by AHCCCSA


                                      -74-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media and must be
submitted in the PMMIS AHCCCSA supplied formats. Specific requirements for
encounter data are described in the AHCCCSA Encounter Reporting User Manual, a
copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library. The Encounter Submission
Requirements are included herein as Attachment I. Refer to Paragraph 64, Data
Exchange Requirements, for further information.

An Encounter Submission Tracking Report must be maintained and made available to
AHCCCSA upon request. The Tracking Report's purpose is to link each claim to an
adjudicated or pended encounter returned to the Contractor. Further information
regarding the Encounter Submission Tracking Report may be found in The AHCCCSA
Encounter Reporting User's Manual.

Each month AHCCCSA provides the Contractor with full replacement files
containing provider and medical procedure coding information. These files should
be used to assist the Contractor in accurate Encounter Reporting. Refer to
Paragraph 64, Data Exchange Requirements, for further information.

66. ENROLLMENT AND CAPITATION TRANSACTION UPDATES

AHCCCSA produces daily enrollment transaction updates identifying new members
and changes to members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data, which the
Contractor shall use to update its member records. The daily enrollment
transaction update, which is run prior to the monthly enrollment and capitation
transaction update, is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate
code changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments and
disenrollments.

AHCCCSA also produces a daily Manual Payment Transaction, which identifies
enrollment or disenrollment activity that was not included on the daily
enrollment transaction update due to internal edits. The Contractor shall use
the Manual Payment Transaction in addition to die daily enrollment transaction
update to update its member records.

A weekly capitation transaction will be produced to provide contractors with
member-level capitation payment information. This file will show changes to the
prospective capitation payments, as sent in the monthly file, resulting from
enrollment changes that occur after the monthly file is produced. This file will
also identify mass adjustments to and/or manual capitation payments that
occurred at AHCCCS after the monthly file is produced.

The monthly enrollment and monthly capitation transaction updates are generally
produced two days before the end of every month. The update will identify the
total active population for the Contractor as of the first day of the next
month. These updates contain the information used by AHCCCSA to produce the
monthly capitation payment for the next month. The Contractor will reconcile
their member files with the AHCCCS monthly update. After reconciling the monthly
update information, the Contractor resumes posting daily updates beginning with
the last two days of the month. The last two daily updates are different from
the regular daily updates in that they pay and/or recoup capitation into the
next month. If the Contractor detects an error through the monthly update
process, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Division of Health Care
Management.

Refer to Paragraph 64, Data Exchange Requirements, for further information.

67. PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS

AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its CMS grant award, requires
periodic reports, encounter data, and other information from the Contractor. The
submission of late, inaccurate, or otherwise incomplete reports shall constitute
failure to report subject to the penalty provisions described in this contract.

Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports are as follows
[42 CFR 438.242(b)(2)]:


                                      -75-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

     a.   Timeliness: Reports or other required data shall be received on or
          before scheduled due dates.

     b.   Accuracy: Reports or other required data shall be prepared in strict
          conformity with appropriate authoritative sources and/or AHCCCS
          defined standards.

     c.   Completeness: All required information shall be fully disclosed in a
          manner that is both responsive and pertinent to report intent with no
          material omissions.

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and frequency of
submission of reports are subject to change at any time during the term of the
contract. The Contractor shall comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting beyond the term of
the contract. For example, processing claims and reporting encounter data will
likely continue beyond the term of the contract because of lag time in filing
source documents by subcontractors.

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting requirements contained
in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health Care Contractors with the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's
Library. The required reports, which are subject to change during the contract
term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report Requirements.

68. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract, request financial or
other information from the Contractor. Responses shall fully disclose all
financial or other information requested. Information may be designated as
confidential but may not be withheld from AHCCCS as proprietary. Information
designated as confidential may not be disclosed by AHCCCS without the prior
written consent of the Contractor except as required by law. Upon receipt of
such written requests for information, the Contractor shall provide complete
information as requested no later than 30 days after the receipt of the request
unless otherwise specified in the request itself.

69. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the dissemination of
information prepared by AHCCCSA or the Federal government to its members. The
cost of such dissemination shall be borne by the Contractor. All advertisements,
publications and printed materials that are produced by the Contractor and refer
to covered services shall state that such services are funded under contract
with AHCCCSA.

70. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS

AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews on all
contractors and will, subject to the availability of resources, provide
technical assistance as appropriate. The Readiness Reviews will be conducted
prior to the start of business. The purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess
new Contractors' readiness and ability to provide covered services to members at
the start of the contract year and current Contractors' readiness to expand to
new geographic service areas. A new Contractor will be permitted to commence
operations only if the Readiness Review factors are met to AHCCCSA's
satisfaction.

71. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

In accordance with CMS requirements, AHCCCSA, or an independent external agent,
will conduct annual Operational and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but
not limited to) ensuring operational and financial program compliance [42 CFR
438.204]. The reviews will identify areas where improvements can be made and


                                      -76-

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREIVIENTS                                CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

make recommendations accordingly, monitor the Contractor's progress towards
implementing mandated programs and provide the Contractor with technical
assistance if necessary. The Contractor shall comply with all other medical
audit provisions as required by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-521 and R9-31-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review will be solely at
the discretion of AHCCCSA. Except in cases where advance notice is not possible
or advance notice may render the review less useful, AHCCCSA will give the
Contractor at least three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site
review. In preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews, the
Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AHCCCSA Review Team by
forwarding in advance such policies, procedures, job descriptions, contracts,
logs and other information that AHCCCSA may request. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents, not requested in advance
by AHCCCSA, shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor personnel, as identified in advance, shall
be available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review
activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with
workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences. Certain documentation submission requirements may be waived at the
discretion of AHCCCSA, if the Contractor has obtained accreditation from NCQA,
JCAHO or any other nationally recognized accrediting body. The Contractor must
submit the entire accreditation report to AHCCCSA for such waiver consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a draft copy of the Operational and Financial
Review Report and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings prior
to AHCCCSA publishing the final report. Operational and Financial Review
findings may be used in the scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that
Contractor. Recommendations, made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor
into compliance with Federal, State, AHCCCS, and/or contract requirements, must
be implemented by the Contractor. AHCCCSA may conduct a follow-up Operational
and Financial Review to determine the Contractor's progress in implementing
recommendations and achieving program compliance. Follow-up reviews may be
conducted at any time after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

The Contractor shall not distribute or otherwise make available the Operational
and Financial Review Tool, draft Operational and Financial Review Report nor
final report to other AHCCCS Contractors.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the event the
Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change in ownership or makes
changes in three or more key staff positions within a 12-month period.

AHCCCSA may request, at the expense of the Contractor, to conduct on-site
reviews of functions performed at out-of-state locations. AHCCCSA will
coordinate travel arrangements and accommodations with the Contractor at their
request.

72. SANCTIONS

AHCCCSA may impose monetary sanctions, suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or
terminate this contract or any related subcontracts in accordance with AHCCCS
Rules R9-22-606, ACOM Sanctions Policy and the terms of this contract and
applicable Federal or State law and regulations. [42 CFR 422.208, 42 CFR
438.700, 702, 704 and 45 CFR 92.36(i)(1)] Written notice will be provided to the
Contractor specifying the sanction to be imposed, the grounds for such sanction
and either the length of suspension or the amount of capitation prepayment to be
withheld. The Contractor may dispute the decision to impose a sanction in
accordance with A.A.C. 9-34-401 et seq. Intermediate sanctions may be imposed,
but are not limited to the following actions:

f.   Additional sanctions allowed under statue or regulation that address areas
     of noncompliance.

Cure Notice Process: Prior to the imposition of a sanction for non-compliance,
AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the Contractor regarding the
details of the non-compliance. The cure notice will specify the period of time
during which the Contractor must bring its performance back into compliance with
contract requirements. If, at the end of the specified time period, the
Contractor has complied with the cure notice requirements, AHCCCSA will take no
further action. If, however, the Contractor has not complied with the cure
notice requirements, AHCCCSA may proceed with the imposition of sanctions. Refer
to the ACOM Sanctions Policy for details.

73. BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND RECOVERY PLAN

The Contractor shall adhere to all elements of the ACOM Business Continuity and
Recovery Plan Policy. The Contractor shall develop a Business Continuity and
Recovery Plan to deal with unexpected events that may affect its ability to

75. PENDING LEGISLATIVE / OTHER ISSUES

The following constitute pending items that may be resolved after the issuance
of this contract. Any program changes due to the resolution of the issues will
be reflected in future amendments to the contract. Capitation rates may also be
adjusted to reflect the financial impact of program changes.

ARIZONA EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM: The Arizona Early Intervention (AzEIP)
Program is implemented through the coordinated activities of the Arizona
Department of Economic Security (DES), the Arizona Department of Health
Services (ADHS), Arizona State Schools for the Deaf and Blind (ASDB), the
Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), and the Arizona Department
of Education (ADE). The AzEIP Program is governed by the Individuals with
Disabilities Act (IDEA), Part C (P.L.105-17). AzEIP, through Federal regulation,
is stipulated as the payor of last resort to Medicaid, and is prohibited from
supplanting another entitlement programs, including Medicaid.

AHCCCS is currently working with the Department of Economic Security to provide
increased Medicaid funding to this program. This may result in additional
coordination with the AzEIP program for the Contractors. Any changes will be
communicated to the Contractors and may result in a future contract amendment.

TRANSPORTATION: AHCCCSA is evaluating its methodology, under capitation, for
providing transportation services to its members. Options may include
contracting with a centralized transportation broker to provide services to all
AHCCCS members.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

76. BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997 (BBA)

In August 2002, CMS issued final regulations for the implementation of the BBA.
AHCCCS continues to review all areas of the regulations to ensure full
compliance with the BBA; however, there are some issues that may require further
clarification from CMS. Any program changes due to the resolution of the issues
will be reflected in amendments to the contract. Capitation rates may also be
adjusted to reflect the financial impact of the program changes.

77. HEALTHCARE GROUP OF ARIZONA

AHCCCSA encourages all Contractors to participate in the Healthcare Group (HCG)
program. Legislation was passed in 2002 that shifted administrative
responsibilities from HCG contractors to AHCCCSA. Additionally, effective
February 1, 2003, HCG's service package and premium structure has been
redesigned to better reflect the small group product in the Arizona marketplace.
HCG has created a niche market, as insurance companies are moving away from the
Health Maintenance Organization market. HCG hopes to expand its enrollment,
significantly during the next two years, which will result in a solid membership
base to spread risk, thereby increasing the attractiveness of the HCG product.
For additional information, contact AHCCCSA, Office of the Director.

78. MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT (MMA)

The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 created a prescription drug benefit
called Medicare Part D for individuals who are eligible for Medicare Part A
and/or enrolled in Medicare Part B. Beginning January 1, 2006, AHCCCS will no
longer cover prescription drugs, with very few exceptions, for dual eligible
members. AHCCCS will not cover prescription drugs for this population whether or
not they are enrolled in Medicare Part D. Capitation rates will be adjusted
accordingly to account for this change.

DRUGS EXCLUDED FROM MEDICARE PART D: AHCCCS will continue to cover those drugs
ordered by a PCP, attending physician, dentist or other authorized prescriber
and dispensed under the direction of a licensed pharmacist subject to
limitations related to prescription supply amounts, contractor formularies and
prior authorization requirements if they are excluded from Medicare Part D
coverage.

As the Medicare Modernization Act is folly implemented, there may be required
changes to business practices of AHCCCS and contractors or the contract. AHCCCS
will identify potential impacts and work with contractors to implement necessary
program changes.

creating the contract on behalf of AHCCCSA is, or becomes at any time while the
contract or any extension of the contract is in effect, an employee of, or a
consultant to, any other party to this contract with respect to the subject
matter of the contract. The cancellation shall be effective when the Contractor
receives written notice of the cancellation unless the notice specifies a later
time.

16) GRATUITIES

AHCCCSA may, by written notice to the Contractor, immediately terminate this
contract if it determines that employment or a gratuity was offered or made by
the Contractor or a representative of the Contractor to any officer or employee
of the State for the purpose of influencing the outcome of the procurement or
securing the contract, an amendment to the contract, or favorable treatment
concerning the contract, including the making of any determination or decision
about contract performance. AHCCCSA, in addition to any other rights or
remedies, shall be entitled to recover exemplary damages in the amount of three
times the value of the gratuity offered by the Contractor.

17) SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT

The Contractor shall not employ, consult, subcontract or enter into any
agreement for Title XIX services with any person or entity who is debarred,
suspended or otherwise excluded from Federal procurement activity or from
participating in non-procurement activities under regulations issued under
Executive Order No. 12549 or under guidelines implementing Executive Order 12549
[42 CFR 438.610(a) and (b)]. This prohibition extends to any entity which
employs, consults, subcontracts with or otherwise reimburses for services any
person substantially involved in the management of another entity which is
debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from Federal procurement activity.

The Contractor shall not retain as a director, officer, partner or owner of 5%
or more of the Contractor entity, any person, or affiliate of such a person, who
is debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from Federal procurement activity.

AHCCCSA may, by written notice to the Contractor, immediately terminate this
contract if it determines that the Contractor has been debarred, suspended or
otherwise lawfully prohibited from participating in any public procurement
activity.

18) TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE

AHCCCSA reserves the right to terminate the contract in whole or in part at any
time for the convenience of the State without penalty or recourse. The
Contracting Officer shall give written notice by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the Contractor of the termination at least 90 days before the
effective date of the termination. In the event of termination under this
paragraph, all documents, data and reports prepared by the Contractor under the
contract shall become the property of and be delivered to AHCCCSA. The
Contractor shall be entitled to receive just and equitable compensation for work
in progress, work completed and materials accepted before the effective date of
the termination.

19) TEMPORARY MANAGEMENT/OPERATION OF A CONTRACTOR AND TERMINATION

Temporary Management/Operation by AHCCCSA: Pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997, 42 CFR 438.700 et seq. and State Law ARS Section 36-2903, AHCCCSA is
authorized to impose temporary management for a Contractor under certain
conditions. Under federal law, temporary management may be imposed if AHCCCS
determines that there is continued egregious behavior by the Contractor,
including but not limited to the following: substantial failure to provide
medically necessary services the Contractor is required to provide; imposition
on enrollees premiums or charges that exceed those permitted by AHCCCSA,
discrimination among enrollees on the basis of health status or need for health
care services; misrepresentation or falsification of information to AHCCCSA or
CMS; misrepresentation or falsification of information furnished to an


                                      -83-

<PAGE>

CONTRACT CLAUSES                                      CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

enrollee or provider; distribution of marketing materials that have not been
approved by AHCCCS or that are false or misleading; or behavior contrary to any
requirements of Sections 1903(m) or 1932 of the Social Security Act. Temporary
management may also be imposed if AHCCCSA determines that there is substantial
risk to enrollees' health or that temporary management is necessary to ensure
the health of enrollees while the Contractor is correcting the deficiencies
noted above or until there is an orderly transition or reorganization of die
Contractor. Under federal law, temporary management is mandatory if AHCCCSA
determines that the Contractor has repeatedly failed to meet substantive
requirements in Sections 1903(m) or 1932 of the Social Security Act. In these
situations, AHCCCSA shall not delay imposition of temporary management to
provide a hearing before imposing this sanction.

State law ARS Section 36-2903 authorizes AHCCCSA to operate a Contractor as
specified in this contract. Prior to operation of the Contractor by AHCCCSA
pursuant to state statute, the Contractor shall have the opportunity for a
hearing. If AHCCCSA determines that emergency action is required, operation of
the Contractor may take place prior to hearing. Operation by AHCCCSA shall occur
only as long as it is necessary to assure delivery of uninterrupted care to
members, to accomplish orderly transition of those members to other contractors,
or until the Contractor reorganizes or otherwise corrects contract performance
failure.

Termination: AHCCCSA reserves the right to terminate this contract in whole or
in part due to the failure of the Contractor to comply with any term or
condition of the contract and as authorized by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997
and 42 CFR 438.708. If the Contractor is providing services under more than one
contract with AHCCCSA, AHCCCSA may deem unsatisfactory performance under one
contract to be cause to require the Contractor to provide assurance of
performance under any and all other contracts. In such situations, AHCCCSA
reserves the right to seek remedies under both actual and anticipatory breaches
of contract if adequate assurance of performance is not received. The
Contracting Officer shall mail written notice of the termination and the
reason(s) for it to the Contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested.
Pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and 42 CFR 438.708, AHCCCSA shall
provide the contractor with a pre-termination hearing before termination of the
contract.

Upon termination, all documents, data, and reports prepared by the Contractor
under the contract shall become the property of and be delivered to AHCCCSA on
demand.

AHCCCSA may, upon termination of this contract, procure on terms and in the
manner that it deems appropriate, materials or services to replace those under
this contract. The Contractor shall be liable for any excess costs incurred by
AHCCCSA in re-procuring the materials or services.

20) TERMINATION - AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS

Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond the
current fiscal year. No legal liability on the part of AHCCCSA for any payment
may arise under this contract until funds are made available for performance of
this contract.

21) RIGHT OF OFFSET

AHCCCSA shall be entitled to offset against any amounts due the Contractor any
expenses or costs incurred by AHCCCSA concerning the Contractor's non-conforming
performance or failure to perform the contract.

22) NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES

The rights and the remedies of AHCCCSA under this contract are not exclusive.

23) NON-DISCRIMINATION

The Contractor shall comply with State Executive Order No. 99-4, which mandates
that all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or
political affiliation, shall have equal access to employment opportunities, and
all other applicable Federal and state laws, rules and regulations, including
the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI. The Contractor shall take
positive action to ensure that applicants for employment, employees, and persons
to whom it provides service are not discriminated against due to race, creed,
color, religion, sex, national origin or disability.

     self-insured status will also be considered.

d.   Professional Liability (if applicable): Provides coverage for alleged
     professional misconduct or lack of ordinary skills in the performance of a
     professional act of service.

The above coverages may be evidenced by either one of the following:

     special conditions required by the contract already pre-printed on the
     form. The Contractor's agent or broker must fill in the pertinent policy
     information and ensure the required special conditions are included in the
     Contractor's policy.

b.   The Accord form: This standard insurance industry certificate of insurance
     does not contain the preprinted special conditions required by this
     contract. These conditions must be entered on the certificate by the agent
     or broker and read as follows:

     The State of Arizona and Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System are
     hereby added as additional insureds. Coverage afforded under this
     Certificate shall be primary and any insurance carried by the State or any
     of its agencies, boards, departments or commissions shall be in excess of
     that provided by the insured Contractor. No policy shall expire, be
     canceled or materially changed without 30 days written notice to the State.
     This Certificate is not valid unless countersigned by an authorized
     representative of the insurance company.

26) DISPUTES

The exclusive manner for the Contractor to assert any claim, grievance, dispute
or demand against AHCCCS shall be in accordance with Title 9 A.A.C. Chapter 34,

termination or a temporary suspension of performance.

27) RIGHT TO INSPECT PLANT OR PLACE OF BUSINESS

29) COVENANT AGAINST CONTINGENT FEES

The Contractor warrants that no person or agency has been employed or retained
to solicit or secure this contract upon an agreement or understanding for a
commission, percentage, brokerage or contingent fee. For violation of this
warranty, AHCCCSA shall have the right to annul this contract without liability.

30) CHANGES

AHCCCSA may at any time, by written notice to the Contractor, make changes
within the general scope of this contract. If any such change causes an increase
or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of
the work under this contract, the Contractor may assert its right to an
adjustment in compensation paid under this contract. The Contractor must assert
its right to such adjustment within 30 days from the date of receipt of the
change notice. Any dispute or disagreement caused by such notice shall
constitute a dispute within the meaning of Section E, Paragraph 26, Disputes,
and be administered accordingly.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to modify the contract, the provisions of such
amendment will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing
by AHCCCSA, even if the amendment has not been signed by the Contractor, unless
within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that it refuses to
sign the amendment. If the Contractor provides such notification, AHCCCSA will
initiate termination proceedings.

33) WARRANTY OF SERVICES

The Contractor warrants that all services provided under this contract will
conform to the requirements stated herein. AHCCCSA's acceptance of services
provided by the Contractor shall not relieve the Contractor from its obligations
under this warranty. In addition to its other remedies, AHCCCSA may, at the

the Contractor's warranty herein. Services corrected by the Contractor shall be
subject to all of the provisions of this contract in the manner and to the same

relationship prior to accepting any assignment involving such party.

designees appointed by the Director, shall be vested with full and exclusive
power of management and control of the Contractor as necessary to ensure the
uninterrupted care to persons and accomplish the orderly transition of persons

ATTACHMENT A: MINIMUM SUBCONTRACT PROVISIONS

[The following provisions must be included verbatim in every subcontract.]

1) ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

No payment due the Subcontractor under this subcontract may be assigned without
the prior approval of the Contractor. No assignment or delegation of the duties
of this subcontract shall be valid unless prior written approval is received
from the Contractor. (AAC R2-7-305)

2) AWARDS OF OTHER SUBCONTRACTS

AHCCCSA and/or the Contractor may undertake or award other contracts for
additional or related work to the work performed by the Subcontractor and the
Subcontractor shall fully cooperate with such other Contractors, subcontractors
or state employees. The Subcontractor shall not commit or permit any act which
will interfere with the performance of work by any other contractor,
subcontractor or state employee. (AAC R2-7-308)

3) CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE - ANTI-KICKBACK AND LABORATORY TESTING

By signing this subcontract, the Subcontractor certifies that it has not engaged
in any violation of the Medicare Anti-Kickback statute (42 USC Sections
1320a-7b) or the "Stark I" and "Stark II" laws governing related-entity
referrals (PL 101-239 and PL 101-432) and compensation there from. If the
Subcontractor provides laboratory testing, it certifies that it has complied
with 42 CFR Section411.361 and has sent to AHCCCSA simultaneous copies of the
information required by that rule to be sent to the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services. (42 USC Sections 1320a-7b; PL 101-239 and PL 101-432; 42 CFR

4) CERTIFICATION OF TRUTHFULNESS OF REPRESENTATION

By signing this subcontract, the Subcontractor certifies that all
representations set forth herein are true to the best of its knowledge.

5) CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS OF 1988

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) of 1988 requires

CLIA Waiver or CLIA Certificate in order to obtain reimbursement from the
Medicare and Medicaid (AHCCCS) programs. In addition, they must meet all the
requirements of 42 CFR 493, Subpart A.

To comply with these requirements, AHCCCSA requires all clinical laboratories to
provide verification of CLIA Licensure or Certificate of Waiver during the
provider registration process. Failure to do so shall result in either a
termination of an active provider ID number or denial of initial registration.
These requirements apply to all clinical laboratories.

Pass-through billing or other similar activities with the intent of avoiding the
above requirements are prohibited. The Contractor may not reimburse providers
who do not comply with the above requirements. (CLIA of 1988; 42 CFR 493,
Subpart A)

6) COMPLIANCE WITH AHCCCSA RULES RELATING TO AUDIT AND INSPECTION

The Subcontractor shall comply with all applicable AHCCCS Rules and Audit Guide
relating to the audit of the Subcontractor's records and the inspection of the
Subcontractor's facilities. If the Subcontractor is an inpatient facility, the
Subcontractor shall file uniform reports and Title XVIII and Title XIX cost
reports with AHCCCSA. (ARS 41-2548; 45 CFR 74.48 (d))

7) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS

The Subcontractor shall comply with all federal, State and local laws, rules,
regulations, standards and executive orders governing performance of duties
under this subcontract, without limitation to those designated within this
subcontract. (Requirement for FFP, 42 CFR 434.70) [42 CFR 438.6(1)]

The Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration (AHCCCSA) or the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services may evaluate, through inspection or
other means, the quality, appropriateness or timeliness of services performed
under this subcontract. (ARS 36-2903. C., (8.); ARS 36-2903.02; AAC 9-22-522)

fraud or abuse has occurred, the Subcontractor shall report the incident to the
prime Contractor as well as to AHCCCSA, Office of Program Integrity. All
incidents of potential fraud should be reported to AHCCCSA, Office of the
Director, Office of Program Integrity. (ARS 36-2918.01; AAC R9-22-511.)

14) GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION

The parties to this contract agree that AHCCCS shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Contractor and Subcontractor for the vicarious liability of
AHCCCS as a result of entering into this contract. However, the parties further

the responsibility of Subcontractor to indemnify, keep and save harmless and
defend the State and AHCCCSA, their agents, officers and employees as provided
herein. Furthermore, the Subcontractor shall be fully responsible for all tax
obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all other applicable insurance
coverage, for itself and its employees, and AHCCCSA shall have no responsibility
or liability for any such taxes or insurance coverage. (45 CFR Part 74)

16) LIMITATIONS ON BILLING AND COLLECTION PRACTICES

Except as provided in federal and state law and regulations, the Subcontractor
shall not bill, nor attempt to collect payment directly or through a collection
agency from a person claiming to be AHCCCS eligible without first receiving
verification from AHCCCSA that the person was ineligible for AHCCCS on the date
of service, or that services provided were not AHCCCS covered services. (AAC
R9-22-702 and R9-22-201(J)) [42 CFR 438.106]

Subcontractor, or any agent or representative of the Subcontractor, to any
officer or employee of the State with a view towards securing a contract or
securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding, amending or the
making of any determinations with respect to the performance of the
Subcontractor; provided, that the existence of the facts upon which the state
makes such findings shall be in issue and may be reviewed in any competent
court. If the subcontract is terminated under this section, unless the
Contractor is a governmental agency, instrumentality or subdivision thereof,
AHCCCSA shall be entitled to a penalty, in addition to any other damages to
which it may be entitled by law, and to exemplary damages in the amount of three

ATTACHMENT B: MINIMUM NETWORK STANDARDS               CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

ATTACHMENT B: MINIMUM NETWORK STANDARDS (By Geographic Service Area)

INSTRUCTIONS:

Contractors shall have in place an adequate network of providers capable of
meeting contract requirements. The information that follows describes the
minimum network requirements by Geographic Service Area (GSA). In some GSA's
there are required service sites located outside of the geographical boundary of
a GSA. The reason for this relates to practical access to care. In certain
instances, a member must travel a much greater distance to receive services
within their assigned GSA, if the member were not allowed to receive services in
an adjoining GSA or state.

Split zip codes occur in some counties. Split zip codes are those which straddle
two different counties. Enrollment for members residing in these zip codes is
based upon the county and GSA to which the entire zip code has been assigned by
AHCCCS. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing services to members
residing in the entire zip code that is assigned to the GSA for which the
Contractor has agreed to provide services. The split zip codes GSA assignments
are as follows:

</TABLE>

If outpatient specialty services (OB, family planning, and pediatrics) are not
included in the primary care provider contract, at least one subcontract is
required for each of these specialties in the service sites specified.

In Tucson (GSA 10) and Metropolitan Phoenix (GSA 12), the Contractor must
demonstrate its ability to provide PCP, dental and pharmacy services so that
members don't need to travel more than 5 miles from their residence.
Metropolitan Phoenix is defined on the Minimum Network Standard page specific to
GSA # 12.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall have a physician with admitting and treatment
privileges with each hospital in its network. Contractors in GSA 10 and/or GSA
12 must have at least one hospital contract in each service district. This
requirement is part of the Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement Pilot
Program, described more fully in Section D, Paragraph 35, Hospital
Reimbursement. A list of Phoenix and Tucson area hospitals are included.

ATTACHMENT G: AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM               CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

ATTACHMENT G: AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not have the right to choose a Contractor or members who have the
right to choose but do not exercise this right, are assigned to a Contractor
through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a mathematical formula
used to distribute members to the various Contractors in a manner that is
predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals.

The algorithm employs a data table and a formula to assign cases (a case may be
a member or a household of members) to Contractors using the target percentages
developed. The algorithm data table consists of all the geographic service areas
(GSA) in the state, all Contractors serving each GSA, and the target percentages
by risk group within each GSA.

The Contractor farthest away from its target percentage within a GSA and risk
group, the largest negative difference, is assigned the next case for that GSA.
The equation used is:

          (t/T) - P = d

t = The total members assigned to the GSA, per risk group category, for the
    Contractor

T = The total members assigned to the GSA, per risk group category, all
    Contractors combined

P = The target percentage of members per risk group for the Contractor

d = The difference

The algorithm is calculated after each assignment to give a new difference for
each Contractor. When more than one Contractor has the same difference, and
their differences are greater than all other Contractors, the Contractor with
the lowest Health Plan I.D. Number will be assigned the case.

Assignment by the algorithm applies to:

     1.   Members that are newly eligible to the AHCCCS program that did not
          choose a Contractor within the prescribed time limits.

     2.   Members whose assigned health plan is no longer available after the
          member moves to a new GSA and did not choose a new Contractor within
          the prescribed time limits.

     3.   Members whose assigned plan is no longer available at the beginning of
          a contract cycle that did not choose a Contractor within the
          prescribed time limits.

All Contractors, within a given geographic service area (GSA) and for each risk
group, will have a placement in the algorithm and will receive members
accordingly. A Contractor with a more favorable target percentage in the
algorithm will receive proportionally more members. Conversely, a Contractor
with a lower target percentage in the algorithm will receive proportionally
fewer members. The algorithm favors Contractors with both lower final bids and
awarded rates. The algorithm also favors those Contractors that score higher on
selected Performance Measures (See Section D, Paragraph 24, Performance
Measures).

For Contractors in the Maricopa and Pima/Santa Cruz GSAs with fewer than 25,000
members statewide, a temporary adjustment will be made to the algorithm formula
in order to ensure a minimum membership (see the discussion entitled "Adjustment
Methodology for Contractors with Fewer than 25,000 Members" for more
information).

Development of the Target Percentages

Beginning in CYE '06, the algorithm target percentages will be developed using
the methodology described below. However, for subsequent years, AHCCCS reserves
the right to change the algorithm methodology to assure assignments are made in
the best interest of the AHCCCS program and the State.

A Contractor's placement in the algorithm is based upon the following three
factors, which are weighted as follows:

1   The final capitation rate bid submitted by the Contractor.           30%
    Final bids that are below the bottom of the rate range will be
    assigned to the bottom of the rate range for development of the
    target percentages.

2   The Contractor's final awarded rate from AHCCCSA.                    30%

3   The Contractor's ranking in Well-Child visits, 3, 4, 5, and 6        40%
    Years of Age (weighted 75%) and Timeliness of Prenatal Care
    (weighted 25%) Performance measures (measurement period CYE
    2004, reported in CYE 2005).
</TABLE>

Points will be assigned to each Contractor by risk group by GSA. Based on the
rankings of the final bid rates and the final awarded rates, each Contractor
will be assigned a number of points for each of these two components separately
as follows:

Contractors that have equal bids in a GSA for the same risk group will be given
an equal percentage of the points for all of the positions combined.

The third component of the calculation, Performance Measure Rates (PMR), will be
assigned a number of points based on the Contractor's ranking among the rates
for the selected Performance Measures. The higher the rate, the more points
assigned. For this component, points will be assigned as follows:

ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY FOR CONTRACTORS WITH FEWER THAN 25,000 MEMBERS

At the beginning of the new contract cycle, the auto-assignment algorithm for
the Maricopa and Pima/Santa Cruz GSAs will be adjusted to favor Contractors with
fewer than 25,000 members statewide. The adjusted algorithm will be utilized
until a target membership of 25,000 members statewide, per Contractor, is
reached.

The adjustment will be made to the final percentages developed using the
methodology above. A pre-determined percentage, based on the table below, will
be added to the affected Contractor(s) and subtracted evenly from the other
Contractors.

     a grievance or appeal.

3.   The availability of assistance in the filing process and the Contractor's
     toll-free numbers that an enrollee can use to file a grievance or appeal by
     phone if requested by the enrollee.

4.   That the Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of each grievance and appeal.
     For Appeals, the Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of standard appeals
     in writing within five business days of receipt and within one business day
     of receipt of expedited appeals.

5.   That the Contractor shall permit both oral and written appeals and
     grievances and that oral inquiries appealing an action are treated as
     appeals.

6.   That the Contractor shall ensure that individuals who make decisions
     regarding grievances and appeals are individuals not involved in any
     previous level of review or decision making and that individuals who make
     decisions regarding: 1) appeals of denials based on lack of medical
     necessity, 2) a grievance regarding denial of expedited resolution of an
     appeal or 3) grievances or appeals involving clinical issues are health
     care professionals as defined in 42 CFR 438.2 with the appropriate clinical
     expertise in treating the enrollee's condition or disease.

     obtain services outside the Contractor's network under 42 CFR
     438.52(b)(2)(ii) when the Contractor is the only Contractor in the rural
     area.

17.  The definition of a standard authorization request. For standard
     authorization decisions, the Contractor must provide a Notice of Action to
     the enrollee as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires,
     but not later than 14 days following the receipt of the authorization with
     a possible extension of up to 14 days if the enrollee or provider requests
     an extension or if the Contractor establishes a need for additional
     information and delay is in the enrollee's best interest. [42 CFR
     438.210(d)(1)]

18.  The definition of an expedited authorization request. For expedited
     authorization decisions, the Contractor must provide a Notice of Action to

19.  That the Notice of Action for a service authorization decision not made
     within the standard or expedited timeframes, whichever is applicable, will
     be made on the date that the timeframes expire. If the Contractor extends
     the timeframe to make a standard or expedited authorization decision, the
     contractor must give the enrollee written notice of the reason to extend
     the timeframe and inform the enrollee of the right to file a grievance if
     the enrollee disagrees with the decision. The Contractor must issue and
     carry out its decision as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition
     requires and no later than the date the extension expires.

               information);

          c.   The enrollee is admitted to an institution where he is ineligible
               for further services;

     that the enrollee may be held liable for the cost of benefits if the
     hearing decision upholds the Contractor.

33.  That the Contractor continues extended benefits originally provided to the
     enrollee until any of the following occurs: 1) the enrollee withdraws
     appeal, 2) the enrollee has not specifically requested continued benefits
     pending a hearing decision within 10 days of the Contractor mailing of the

ATTACHMENT I: ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will be assessed sanctions for noncompliance with encounter
submission requirements. AHCCCSA may also perform special reviews of encounter
data, such as comparing encounter reports to the Contractor's claims files. Any
findings of incomplete or inaccurate encounter data may result in the imposition
of sanctions or requirement of a corrective action plan.

PENDED ENCOUNTER CORRECTIONS

The Contractor must resolve all pended encounters within 120 days of the
original processing date. Sanctions will be imposed according to the following
schedule for each encounter pended for more than 120 days unless the pend is due
to AHCCCSA error:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
 0-120 days   121-180 days    181-240 days   241 - 360 days     361 + days
 ----------   ------------   -------------   --------------   -------------
<S>           <C>            <C>             <C>              <C>
No sanction   $5 per month   $10 per month    $15 per month   $20 per month
</TABLE>

"AHCCCSA error" is defined as a pended encounter, which (1) AHCCCSA acknowledges
to be the result of its own error, and (2) requires a change to the system
programming, an update to the database reference table, or further research by
AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust the sanction amount if
circumstances warrant.

When the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA, in writing, that the resolution of a
pended encounter depends on AHCCCSA rather than the Contractor, AHCCCSA will
respond in writing within 30 days of receipt of such notification. The AHCCCSA
response will report the status of each pending encounter problem or issue in
question.

Pended encounters will not qualify as AHCCCSA errors if AHCCCSA reviews the
Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to research the issue and
provide additional substantiating documentation, or if AHCCCSA disagrees with
the Contractor's claim of AHCCCSA error. If a pended encounter being researched
by AHCCCSA is later determined not to be caused by AHCCCSA error, the Contractor
may be sanctioned retroactively.

Before imposing sanctions, AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor, in writing, of
the total number of sanctionable encounters pended more than 120 days. Pended
encounters shall not be deleted by the Contractor as a means of avoiding
sanctions for failure to correct encounters within 120 days. The Contractor
shall document deleted encounters and shall maintain a record of the deleted
CRNs with appropriate reasons indicated. The Contractor shall, upon request,
make this documentation available to AHCCCSA for review.

ENCOUNTER VALIDATION STUDIES

Per CMS requirement, AHCCCSA will conduct encounter validation studies of the
Contractor's encounter submissions, and sanction the Contractor for
noncompliance with encounter submission requirements. The purpose of encounter
validation studies is to compare recorded utilization information from a medical
record or other source with the Contractor's submitted encounter data. Any and
all covered services may be validated as part of these studies. Encounter
validation studies will be conducted at least yearly.

AHCCCSA may revise study methodology, timelines, and sanction amounts based on
agency review or as a result of consultations with CMS. The Contractor will be
notified in writing of any significant change in study methodology.

AHCCCSA will conduct two encounter validation studies. Study "A" examines
non-institutional services (form HCFA 1500 encounters), and Study "B" examines
institutional services (form UB-92 encounters).

ATTACHMENT I: ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS       CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction amounts and of the
selected data needed for encounter validation studies. The Contractor will have
90 days to submit the requested data to AHCCCSA. In the case of medical records
requests, the Contractor's failure to provide AHCCCSA with the records requested
within 90 days may result in a sanction of $1,000 per missing medical record. If
AHCCCSA does not receive a sufficient number of medical records from the
Contractor to select a statistically valid sample for a study, the Contractor
may be sanctioned up to 5% of its annual capitation payment.

The criteria used in encounter validation studies may include timeliness,
correctness, and omission of encounters. These criteria are defined as follows:

Timeliness: The time elapsed between the date of service and the date that the
encounter is received at AHCCCS. Ninety-five percent (95%) of all encounters
must be received by AHCCCSA no later than 240 days after the end of the month in
which the service was rendered, or the effective date of enrollment with the
Contractor, whichever is later. For all encounters for which timeliness is
evaluated, a sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the population of
encounters may be assessed if the encounter record is received by AHCCCSA more
than 240 days after the date determined above. It is anticipated that the
sanction amount will be $1.00 per error extrapolated to the population of
encounters; however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that
encounter quality has changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements. The
Contractor will be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at
the time the studies begin.

Correctness: A correct encounter contains a complete and accurate description of
AHCCCS covered services provided to a member. A sanction per encounter error
extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if the encounter is
incomplete or incorrectly coded. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will
be $1.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters; however,
sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality
has changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be
notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the
studies begin.

Omission of data: An encounter not submitted to AHCCCSA or an encounter
inappropriately deleted from AHCCCSA's pending encounter file or historical
files in lieu of correction of such record. For Study "A" and for Study "B", a
sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be
assessed for an omission. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be
$5.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "A" and
$10.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "B";
however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter
quality has changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements. The Contractor
will be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time
the studies begin.

For encounter validation studies, AHCCCSA will select all approved and pended
encounters to be studied no earlier than 240 days after the end of the month in
which the service was rendered. Once AHCCCSA has selected the Contractor's
encounters for encounter validation studies, subsequent encounter submissions
for the period being studied will not be considered.

AHCCCSA may review all of the Contractor's submitted encounters, or may select a
sample. The sample size, or number of encounters to be reviewed, will be
determined using statistical methods in order to accurately estimate the
Contractor's error rates. Error rates will be calculated by dividing the number
of errors found by the number of encounters reviewed. A 95% confidence interval
will be used to account for limitations caused by sampling. The confidence
interval shows the range within which the true error rate is estimated to be. If
error rates are based on a sample, the error rate used for sanction purposes
will be the lower limit of the confidence interval.

Encounter validation methodology and statistical formulas are provided in the
AHCCCS Encounter Data Validation Technical Document, which is available in the
Bidders Library. This document also provides examples, which illustrate how
AHCCCSA determines study sample sizes, error rates, confidence intervals, and
sanction amounts.

ATTACHMENT I: ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS       CONTRACT/RFP No. YH04-0001

Written preliminary results of all encounter validation studies will be sent to
the Contractor for review and comment. The Contractor will have a maximum of 30
days to review results and provide AHCCCSA with additional documentation that
would affect the final calculation of error rates and sanctions. AHCCCSA will
examine the Contractor's documentation and may revise study results if
warranted. Written final results of the study will then be sent to the
Contractor and communicated to CMS, and any sanctions will be assessed.

The Contractor may file a written challenge to sanctions assessed by AHCCCSA not
more than 35 days after the Contractor receives final study results from
AHCCCSA. Challenges will be reviewed by AHCCCSA and a written decision will be
rendered no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of a timely challenge.
Sanctions shall not apply to encounter errors successfully challenged. A
challenge must be filed on a timely basis and a decision must be rendered by
AHCCCSA prior to filing a claim dispute and request for hearing pursuant to
A.A.C. 9-34-401 et seq. Sanction amounts will be deducted from the Contractor's
capitation payment.

ENCOUNTER CORRECTIONS

Contractors are required to submit replacement or voided encounters in the event
that claims are subsequently corrected following the initial encounter
submission. This includes corrections as a result of inaccuracies identified by
fraud and abuse audits or investigations conducted by AHCCCSA or the Contractor.
Contractors shall refer to the Encounter Reporting User Manual for instructions
regarding submission of corrected encounters.
