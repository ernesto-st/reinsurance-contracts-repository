<U>Commitment to Lend</U>. Borrower agrees to borrow from each Lender, and each
Lender severally agrees to make advances of its Pro Rata Share of the Loan
proceeds to Borrower in amounts at any one time outstanding not to exceed such
Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of the Loan and (except for Administrative Agent with

The unpaid principal balance of this Loan from day to day outstanding which is
not past due, shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate of interest equal to
the BBA LIBOR Daily Floating Rate plus the LIBOR Margin. The &#147;BBA LIBOR Daily
Floating Rate&#148; shall mean a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the British
Bankers Association LIBOR Rate (&#147;BBA LIBOR&#148;), as published by Reuters (or other
commercially available source providing quotations of BBA LIBOR as selected by
Administrative Agent from time to time) as determined for each Business Day at
approximately 11:00 a.m. London time two (2) London Banking Days prior to the
date in question, for U.S. Dollar deposits (for delivery on the first day of
such interest period) with a one month term, as adjusted from time to time in
Administrative Agent&#146;s sole discretion for reserve requirements, deposit
insurance assessment rates and other regulatory costs. If such rate is not
available at such time for any reason, then the rate will be determined by such
alternative method as reasonably selected by Administrative Agent. A &#147;London
Banking Day&#148; is a day on which banks in London are open for business and
dealing in offshore dollars. Interest shall be computed for the actual number
of days which have elapsed, on the basis of a 360-day year. </FONT></P>

law or regulation or compliance therewith by any Lender prohibits or restricts
or makes impossible the charging of interest based on the BBA LIBOR Daily
Floating Rate and such Lender so notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower,
then until Administrative Agent notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension no longer exist, interest shall accrue and be payable
on the unpaid principal balance of this Loan from the date Administrative Agent
so notifies Borrower until the Maturity Date of this Loan (whether by
acceleration, declaration, extension or otherwise) at a fluctuating rate of
interest equal to the Base Rate. Each Lender agrees to designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will
not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender. </FONT></P>

<U>Default Rate</U>. After the occurrence of a Default (including the expiration
of any applicable cure period), Administrative Agent, in Administrative Agent&#146;s
sole discretion and without notice or demand, may raise the rate of interest
accruing on the Principal Debt a rate per annum (the &#147;Default Rate&#148;) equal to
the BBA LIBOR Daily Floating Rate (or, if unavailable pursuant to Section
1.7.1, the Prime Rate) plus 6.65%. </FONT></P>

<U>Prepayment</U>. Borrower may prepay the principal balance of this Loan, in
full at any time or in part from time to time, without fee, premium or penalty,
provided that: (a) Administrative Agent shall have actually received from
Borrower prior written notice of (i) Borrower&#146;s intent to prepay, (ii) the
amount of principal which will be prepaid (the &#147;Prepaid Principal&#148;), and (iii)
the date on which the prepayment will be made; (b) each prepayment shall be in
a minimum amount of $1,000 or more (unless the prepayment retires the
outstanding balance of this Loan in full); and (c) each prepayment shall be in
the amount of 100% of the Prepaid Principal, plus accrued unpaid interest
thereon to the date of prepayment, plus any other sums which have become due to
Administrative Agent and Lenders under the Loan Documents on or before the date
of prepayment but have not been paid. If this Loan is prepaid in full, any
commitment of Lenders for further advances shall automatically terminate. </FONT></P>

<U>Late Charge</U>. If Borrower shall fail to make any payment due hereunder or
under the terms of any Note within fifteen (15) days after the date such
payment is due, Borrower shall pay to the applicable Lender or Lenders on
demand a late charge equal to 4% of such payment. Such fifteen (15) day period
shall not be construed as in any way extending the due date of any payment. The
&#147;late charge&#148; is imposed for the purpose of defraying the expenses of a Lender
incident to handling such defaulting payment. This charge shall be in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any other remedy Lenders may have and is in addition to
any fees and charges of any agents or attorneys which Administrative Agent or
Lenders may employ upon the occurrence of a Default, whether authorized herein
or by Law. </FONT></P>

maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as &#147;Taxes&#148;). If Borrower shall be
required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
under any Loan Document to Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum
payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section), Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Borrower
shall make such deductions, (iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable Laws, and (iv) within thirty (30) days after the date of such
payment, Borrower shall furnish to Administrative Agent (which shall forward
the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
In addition, Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court
or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or
from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or
otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as &#147;Other

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
If Borrower shall be required by the Laws of any jurisdiction outside the
United States to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable under any Loan Document to Administrative Agent or any Lender, Borrower
shall also pay to Administrative Agent (for the account of such Lender) or to
such Lender, at the time interest is paid, such additional amount that such
Lender specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring
in United States (federal and state) taxes imposed on or measured by net
income) Lender would have received if such deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) had not been made. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
Borrower agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full

Administrative Agent and such Lender and any liability (including penalties,
interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case
whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Tribunal. Payment under this subsection (d) shall be

Administrative Agent shall notify (such notice being referred to as the

if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender. Each non-Defaulting Lender shall have the
right, but in no event or under any circumstance the obligation, to fund such

of the Default Notice (the &#147;Election Period&#148;), such non-Defaulting Lender or

the commitment to fund the Defaulting Lender Amount shall be apportioned pro

Electing Lender&#146;s Commitment bears to the total Commitments of all Electing
Lenders. If the Defaulting Lender fails to pay the Defaulting Lender Payment
Amount within the Election Period, the Electing Lender or Lenders, as
applicable, shall be automatically obligated to fund the Defaulting Lender
Amount (and Defaulting Lender shall no longer be entitled to fund such
Defaulting Lender Amount) within three (3) Business Days following the
expiration of the Election Period to reimburse Administrative Agent or make
payment to Borrower, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if Administrative Agent has funded the Defaulting Lender
Amount, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement for its portion

matters with respect to the Loan Documents, a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed

Document which is made subsequent to the Defaulting Lender&#146;s becoming a

Administrative Agent to do so on such Lender&#146;s behalf. Administrative Agent

notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or
telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it
to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
person or persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including
counsel to any party to the Loan Documents), independent accountants and other
experts selected by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Lenders or all Lenders if required hereunder as it deems
appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its

incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders or such greater
number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance, and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon all Lenders. In the absence of written instructions from the

will have a Material Adverse Effect. Administrative Agent will notify Lenders
of its receipt of any such notice. Administrative Agent shall take such action
with respect to such Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance
with Article 4; provided, however, that unless and until Administrative Agent
has received any such request, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of
Lenders.</FONT></P>

Each Lender acknowledges that none of Agent-Related Persons has made any

hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of Borrower and Guarantor, shall be deemed to constitute
any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lenders as to
any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material
information in their possession. Each Lender represents to Administrative Agent
that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
Borrower and Guarantor, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to
enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrower and Guarantor
hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without

information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as

information then in Administrative Agent&#146;s possession with respect to the Loan
and bearing on the continuing creditworthiness of Borrower or any Guarantor, or
any of their respective Affiliates; provided that nothing contained in this

Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to provide any Lender with any

disclosure thereof (provided such contractual restrictions shall not apply to
distributing to a Lender factual and financial information expressly required
to be provided herein). Except as set forth above, Administrative Agent shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lenders with any credit or

each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities

Person&#146;s own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no
action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be

Administrative Agent is not reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrower, each Lender
shall reimburse Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any

America, N.A. or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any party to
the Loan Documents, or their respective Affiliates (including information that

irrespective of whether or not Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have
made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such
Indebtedness may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency
different from that of the applicable depositor indebtedness. Each Lender

herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the portions of the Loan advanced
by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any
right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share
contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the portions of the Loan made by them as shall be necessary
to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such
portions of the Loan or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with
each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the
circumstances described in Section 6.4 (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall
to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing
Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such
paying Lender&#146;s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such paying Lender&#146;s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered
from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by
the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered without
further interest thereon. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off), but
subject to Section 6.7 with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding
in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this
Section and will in each case notify Lenders following any such purchases or
repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section
shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices,
requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement
with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as
though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations
purchased. </FONT></P>

<U>Draw Request</U>. A &#147;Draw Request&#148; means a properly completed and executed
written application by Borrower to Administrative Agent in the form of Exhibit
&#147;F-1&#148; (or in another form satisfactory to Administrative Agent) setting forth
the amount of Loan proceeds desired, together with the related AIA Document
G-702 and G-703 or such other forms approved by Administrative Agent and such
schedules, affidavits, releases, waivers, statements, paid invoices, paid
bills, and other documents, certificates and information satisfactory to
Administrative Agent, provided that, with respect to any item of Tenant
Improvement Costs for which the tenant, rather than Borrower, is performing the
work, the foregoing documents shall only be required to the extent that the
applicable lease requires such tenant to deliver same. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any tenant of the Improvements who has accepted
occupancy and is paying rent, in lieu of the foregoing conditions in this
Section 1, Borrower may deliver to Administrative Agent the following: (i)
final lien waivers and proof of payment by Borrower and (ii) an executed
estoppel or rent commencement agreement from the tenant confirming that all of
Borrower&#146;s tenant improvement obligations have been satisfied. At least five
(5) Business Days before the requested date of each advance made from the Loan,
Borrower shall deliver a Draw Request to Administrative Agent. Borrower shall
be entitled to an advance only in an amount approved by Administrative Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Loan Documents. Lenders
shall not be required to make advances more frequently than once each calendar
month. Lenders shall, only upon the satisfaction, as determined by
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, of all applicable conditions of
this Agreement and the Loan Documents, be required to make the requested
advance to Borrower on a Funding Date which is a Business Day within five (5),
or if any portion of such advance is LIBOR Rate Principal, eight (8), Business
Days after such satisfaction. Each Draw Request, and Borrower&#146;s acceptance of
any advance, shall be deemed to ratify and confirm, as of the date of the Draw
Request and the advance, respectively, that, except as specified in the Draw
Request, (a) all representations and warranties in the Loan Documents remain
true and correct, and all covenants and agreements in the Loan Documents remain
satisfied, (b) there is no uncured Default existing under the Loan Documents,
(c) all conditions to the advance, whether or not evidence thereof is required
by Administrative Agent, are satisfied, (d) the waivers, statements, paid
invoices, paid bills, and/or other documents, certificates and information
required as set forth above submitted for the Draw Request are complete and
correct, and in all respects what they purport and appear to be for the amount
and period applicable to the Draw Request, (e) all advances previously made to
Borrower were disbursed, and the proceeds of the advance requested in the Draw
Request will immediately be disbursed, for reimbursement to Borrower for, the
costs and expenses specified in the Draw Request for which the advances were
made, and for no other purpose, and (f) after the advance, all obligations for
work and other costs heretofore incurred by Borrower in connection with the
Project and which are due and payable will be fully paid and satisfied.</FONT></P>

<U>Advances</U>. Borrower shall disburse all advances, other than the Initial
Advance made to Borrower, for reimbursement of payments of the Tenant
Improvement Costs or Leasing Commissions only, specified in the Draw Request
for which the advances were made, </FONT></P>

Request, all supporting documentation and information required by
Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent will determine the amount of the
advance Lenders shall make in accordance with this Agreement, the Loan
Documents, and if and to the extent required by Administrative Agent, to
Administrative Agent&#146;s satisfaction, the following standards:</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
<U>Approved Leases</U>. Borrower shall not enter into any tenant lease of space
in the Improvements unless satisfactory to or deemed satisfactory to
Administrative Agent prior to execution. Borrower&#146;s standard form of tenant
lease, and any revisions thereto, must have the prior written approval of
Administrative Agent. Any tenant lease shall be &#147;deemed&#148; satisfactory to
Administrative Agent that (a) is on the standard form lease approved by
Administrative Agent, with no deviations except as satisfactory to
Administrative Agent; (b) is entered into in the ordinary course of business
with a bona fide unrelated third party tenant, and Borrower, acting in good
faith and exercising due diligence, has determined that the tenant is
financially capable of performing its obligations under the lease; (c) is
received by Administrative Agent (together with each guarantee thereof (if any)
and financial information regarding the tenant and each guarantor (if any)
received by Borrower) within fifteen (15) days after execution; (d) reflects an
arms-length transaction at then current market rate for comparable space; (e)
contains no right to purchase the Property, or any present or future interest
therein; (f) does not cover in excess of 25% of the aggregate net rentable area
of the Improvements; and (g) is expressly subordinate to the Mortgage. Borrower
shall provide to Administrative Agent a correct and complete copy of each
tenant lease, including any exhibits, and each guarantee thereof (if any),
prior to execution unless the lease in question is reasonably satisfactory to
Administrative Agent under the foregoing requirements. Borrower shall,
throughout the term of this Agreement, pay all reasonable costs incurred by
Administrative Agent in connection with Administrative Agent&#146;s review and
approval of tenant leases and each guarantee thereof (if any), including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
<U>Effect of Lease Approval</U>. No approval of any lease by Administrative
Agent shall be for any purpose other than to protect Lenders&#146; security, and to
preserve Lenders&#146; rights under the Loan Documents. No approval by
Administrative Agent shall result in a waiver of any default of Borrower. In no
event shall any approval by Administrative Agent of a lease be a representation
of any kind, with regard to the lease or its adequacy or enforceability, or the
financial capacity of any tenant or guarantor.</FONT></P>

Administrative Agent and Lenders that Borrower has delivered to Administrative
Agent a true and correct copy of all tenant leases and each guarantee thereof
(if any), affecting any part of the Improvements, together with an accurate and
complete rent roll for the Project, and no such lease or guarantee contains any
option to purchase all or any portion of the Property or any interest therein

any portion thereof or interest therein.</FONT></P>

further exercise thereof, and every Right may be exercised at any time and from
time to time. No failure by Administrative Agent or Lenders to exercise, nor
delay in exercising any Right, including but not limited to the right to

otherwise called for hereunder or thereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be
paid to Lenders for the use, forbearance, or detention of the Loan shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and
spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so
that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the
maximum lawful rate from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for

2.1. Mortgagor represents, warrants, and covenants as follows:</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
<U>Payment and Performance</U>. Mortgagor will make due and punctual
payment of the Secured Indebtedness. Mortgagor will timely and properly perform
and comply with all of the covenants, agreements, and conditions imposed upon
it by this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents and will not permit a default
to occur hereunder or thereunder. Time shall be of the essence in this
Mortgage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<U>Title and Permitted Encumbrances</U>. Mortgagor has, in Mortgagor&#146;s
own right, and Mortgagor covenants to maintain, lawful, good and marketable
title to the Property, is lawfully seized and possessed of the Property and
every part thereof, and has the right to convey the same, free and clear of all
liens, charges, claims, security interests, and encumbrances except for (i) the
matters, if any, set forth under the heading &#147;Permitted Encumbrances&#148; in <U>Exhibit
B</U> hereto, </FONT></P>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="100%" SIZE=4><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE='PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: ALWAYS'></P><PAGE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>which are Permitted
Encumbrances only to the extent the same are valid and subsisting and affect
the Property, (ii) the liens and security interests evidenced by this Mortgage,
(iii) statutory liens for real estate taxes and assessments on the Property
which are not yet delinquent, and (iv) other liens and security interests (if
any) in favor of Mortgagee (the matters described in the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) being herein called the &#147;Permitted Encumbrances&#148;).
Mortgagor owns and holds the Fee Parcel in fee simple absolute. Mortgagor is
the owner of a valid and subsisting interest as tenant under the Ground Lease,
that the Ground Lease is in full force and effect, there are no defaults
thereunder and no event has occurred or is occurring which after notice or
passage of time or both will result in such a default, that the Ground Lease is
subject to no lien, charge or encumbrance of any kind and is prior to all
liens, charges and encumbrances whatsoever on the fee interest of the lessor
thereunder except such as are listed as exceptions to title in the title policy
insuring the lien hereof. Mortgagor, and Mortgagor&#146;s successors and assigns,
will warrant generally and forever defend title to the Property, subject as
aforesaid, to Mortgagee and his successors or substitutes and assigns, against
the claims and demands of all persons claiming or to claim the same or any part
thereof. Mortgagor will preserve the leasehold estate created in it by the
Ground Lease, and will forever warrant and defend the same to Mortgagee and
will forever warrant and defend the validity and priority of the lien hereof
against the claims of all persons and parties whomsoever. Mortgagor will
perform or cause to be performed all of the covenants and conditions required
to be performed by it under the Ground Lease, will do all things necessary to
preserve unimpaired its rights thereunder, and will not enter into any
agreement modifying or amending the Ground Lease or releasing the lessor
thereunder from any obligations imposed upon it thereby. If Mortgagor receives
a notice of default under the Ground Lease, it shall immediately cause a copy
of such notice to be sent by registered United States mail to Mortgagee. Mortgagor
will punctually pay, perform, observe and keep all covenants, obligations and
conditions in or pursuant to any Permitted Encumbrance and will not modify or
permit modification of any Permitted Encumbrance without the prior written
consent of Mortgagee. Inclusion of any matter as a Permitted Encumbrance does
not constitute approval or waiver by Mortgagee of any existing or future
violation or other breach thereof by Mortgagor, by the Property or otherwise.
No part of the Property constitutes all or any part of the principal residence
of Mortgagor if Mortgagor is an individual. If any right or interest of
Mortgagee in the Property or any part thereof shall be endangered or questioned
or shall be attacked directly or indirectly, Mortgagee and Mortgagee, or either
of them (whether or not named as parties to legal proceedings with respect
thereto), are hereby authorized and empowered to take such steps as in their
discretion may be proper for the defense of any such legal proceedings or the
protection of such right or interest of Mortgagee, including but not limited to
the employment of independent counsel, the prosecution or defense of
litigation, and the compromise or discharge of adverse claims. All expenditures
so made of every kind and character shall be a demand obligation (which
obligation Mortgagor hereby promises to pay) owing by Mortgagor to Mortgagee or
Mortgagee (as the case may be), and the party (Mortgagee or Mortgagee, as the
case may be) making such expenditures shall be subrogated to all rights of the
person receiving such payment.</FONT></P>

imposed upon or against or with respect to the Property or the ownership, use,

as the same become due and payable, including but not limited to all real

basis, against claims for &#147;personal injury&#148; liability, including bodily injury,
death or property damage liability, for the benefit of Mortgagor as named
insured and Mortgagee as additional insured; (5) statutory workers&#146;

other insurance that may be carried by Mortgagor or Mortgagee and that all of
the provisions thereof, except the limits of liability, shall operate in the

insurer which has issued a policy of title, hazard, liability or other
insurance required pursuant to this Mortgage or any other Loan Document becomes
insolvent or the subject of any petition, case, proceeding or other action
pursuant to any Debtor Relief Law, or if in Mortgagee&#146;s reasonable opinion the
financial responsibility of such insurer is or becomes inadequate, Mortgagor
shall, in each instance promptly upon its discovery thereof or upon the request
of Mortgagee therefor, and at Mortgagor&#146;s expense, promptly obtain and deliver
to Mortgagee a like policy (or, if and to the extent permitted by Mortgagee,
acceptable evidence of insurance) issued by another insurer, which insurer and
policy meet the requirements of this Mortgage or such other Loan Document, as
the case may be. Without limiting the discretion of Mortgagee with respect to
required endorsements to insurance policies, all such policies for loss of or
damage to the Property shall contain a standard mortgagee clause (without
contribution) naming Mortgagee as mortgagee with loss proceeds payable to
Mortgagee notwithstanding (i) any act, failure to act or negligence of or
violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained in any such
policy by any named or additional insured; (ii) the occupation or use of the
Property for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms of any such
policy; (iii) any foreclosure or other action by Mortgagee under the Loan
Documents; or (iv) any change in title to or ownership of the Property or any
portion thereof, such proceeds to be held for application as provided in the
Loan Documents. The originals of each initial insurance policy (or to the
extent permitted by Mortgagee, a copy of the original policy and such evidence
of insurance acceptable to Mortgagee) shall be delivered to Mortgagee at the
time of execution of this Mortgage, with all premiums fully paid current, and
each renewal or substitute policy (or evidence of insurance) shall be delivered
to Mortgagee, with all premiums fully paid current, at least ten (10) days
before the termination of the policy it renews or replaces. Mortgagor shall pay
all premiums on policies required hereunder as they become due and payable and

payment thereof. If any loss occurs at any time when Mortgagor has failed to
perform Mortgagor&#146;s covenants and agreements in this paragraph with respect to
any insurance payable because of loss sustained to any part of the Property
whether or not such insurance is required by Mortgagee, Mortgagee shall
nevertheless be entitled to the benefit of all insurance covering the loss and
held by or for Mortgagor, to the same extent as if it had been made payable to
Mortgagee. Upon any foreclosure hereof or transfer of title to the Property in
extinguishment of the whole or any part of the Secured Indebtedness, all of
Mortgagor&#146;s right, title and interest in and to the insurance policies referred
to in this Section (including unearned premiums) and all proceeds payable
thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at foreclosure or other such
transferee, to the extent permissible under such policies. Mortgagee shall have

any claim under, and receive the proceeds of, all insurance for loss of or
damage to the Property where the loss is estimated by Mortgagee to be
$1,000,000 or more, regardless of whether or not such insurance policies are
required by Mortgagee, and the expenses incurred by Mortgagee in the adjustment

incurred by it in the collection of such proceeds and (ii) second to

Mortgagor in restoring the Property and shall be approved by Mortgagee.
Insurance proceeds shall be applied to such restoration solely if (A) Mortgagee
determines that: (i) the Property is capable of being suitably restored in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements to the value, condition,
character and general utility existing prior to such damage or destruction,
and, in any event, to a Loan to Value Ratio of not greater than 70%, provided
that this clause (i) shall not apply to insurance proceeds relating to a
casualty for which the gross insurance proceeds do not exceed $1,000,000; (ii)
sufficient funds are unconditionally available (from proceeds of insurance
and/or from funds of Mortgagor) to enable Mortgagor promptly to commence, and
thereafter diligently to prosecute to completion, such restoration, provided
that this clause (ii) shall not apply to insurance proceeds relating to a
casualty for which the gross insurance proceeds do not exceed $1,000,000; (iii)
Mortgagor is not in default or in breach of any obligations under any Loan
Document, no uncured Default exists under any Loan Document and no facts or
circumstances exist that would constitute a Default with the passage of time or
the giving of notice or both; and (iv) neither the validity, enforceability nor
priority of the lien of this Mortgage shall be adversely affected; (B)
Mortgagor has entered into a written agreement, satisfactory in form and
substance to Mortgagee, containing such conditions to disbursements as are
employed at the time by Mortgagee for construction loans; (C) Mortgagor has

required to assure completion of restoration in accordance with the standards

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
3.1. <U>Assignment</U>. Mortgagor hereby assigns to Mortgagee all Rents
(hereinafter defined) and all of Mortgagor&#146;s rights in and under all Leases
(hereinafter defined). So long as no Default (hereinafter defined) has
occurred, Mortgagor shall have a license (which license shall terminate
automatically and without further notice upon the occurrence of a Default) to
collect, but not prior to accrual, the Rents under the Leases and, where
applicable, subleases, such Rents to be held in trust for Mortgagee, and to
otherwise deal with all Leases as permitted by this Mortgage. Each month,
provided no Default has occurred, Mortgagor may retain such Rents as were
collected that month and held in trust for Mortgagee; provided, however, that
all Rents collected by Mortgagor shall be applied solely to the ordinary and
necessary expenses of owning and operating the Property or paid to Mortgagee.
Upon the revocation of such license, all Rents shall be paid directly to
Mortgagee and not through Mortgagor, all without the necessity of any further
action by Mortgagee, including, without limitation, any action to obtain
possession of the Land, Improvements or any other portion of the Property or
any action for the appointment of a receiver. Mortgagor hereby authorizes and
directs the tenants under the Leases to pay Rents to Mortgagee upon written
demand by Mortgagee, without further consent of Mortgagor, without any
obligation of such tenants to determine whether a Default has in fact occurred
and regardless of whether Mortgagee has taken possession of any portion of the
Property, and the tenants may rely upon any written statement delivered by
Mortgagee to the tenants. Any such payments to Mortgagee shall constitute
payments to Mortgagor under the Leases, and Mortgagor hereby irrevocably
appoints Mortgagee as its attorney-in-fact to do all things, after a Default,
which Mortgagor might otherwise do with respect to the Property and the Leases
thereon, including, without limitation, (i) collecting Rents with or without
suit and applying the same, less expenses of collection, to any of the
obligations secured hereunder or to expenses of operating and maintaining the
Property (including reasonable reserves for anticipated expenses), at the
option of Mortgagee, all in such manner as may be determined by Mortgagee, or
at the option of Mortgagee, holding the same as security for </FONT></P>

Secured Indebtedness, (ii) leasing, in the name of Mortgagor, the whole or any
part of the Property which may become vacant, and (iii) employing agents
therefor and paying such agents reasonable compensation for their services. The
curing of such Default, unless other Defaults also then exist, shall entitle
Mortgagor to recover its aforesaid license to do any such things which
Mortgagor might otherwise do with respect to the Property and the Leases
thereon and to again collect such Rents. The powers and rights granted in this
paragraph shall be in addition to the other remedies herein provided for upon
the occurrence of a Default and may be exercised independently of or
concurrently with any of said remedies. Nothing in the foregoing shall be
construed to impose any obligation upon Mortgagee to exercise any power or
right granted in this paragraph or to assume any liability under any Lease of
any part of the Property and no liability shall attach to Mortgagee for failure
or inability to collect any Rents under any such Lease. The assignment
contained in this Section shall become null and void upon the release of this
Mortgage. As used herein: (i) &#147;Lease&#148; means each existing or future lease,
sublease (to the extent of Mortgagor&#146;s rights thereunder) or other agreement
under the terms of which any person has or acquires any right to occupy or use
the Property, or any part thereof, or interest therein, and each existing or
future guaranty of payment or performance thereunder, and all extensions,
renewals, modifications and replacements of each such lease, sublease,
agreement or guaranty; and (ii) &#147;Rents&#148; means all of the rents, revenue,
income, profits and proceeds derived and to be derived from the Property or
arising from the use or enjoyment of any portion thereof or from any Lease,
including but not limited to the proceeds from any negotiated lease termination
or buyout of such Lease, liquidated damages following default under any such
Lease, all proceeds payable under any policy of insurance covering loss of
rents resulting from untenantability caused by damage to any part of the
Property, all of Mortgagor&#146;s rights to recover monetary amounts from any tenant
in bankruptcy including, without limitation, rights of recovery for use and
occupancy and damage claims arising out of Lease defaults, including
rejections, under any applicable Debtor Relief Law (hereinafter defined),
together with any sums of money that may now or at any time hereafter be or
become due and payable to Mortgagor by virtue of any and all royalties,
overriding royalties, bonuses, delay rentals and any other amount of any kind
or character arising under any and all present and all future oil, gas, mineral

after the cancellation or surrender a new Lease of such premises is made with a

purpose, unilaterally subordinate the lien of this Mortgage to any Lease,
without joinder or consent of, or notice to, Mortgagor, any tenant or any other
person, and notice is hereby given to each tenant under a Lease of such right

time by a specific writing intended for the purpose: (a) waive compliance by
Mortgagor with any covenant herein made by Mortgagor to the extent and in the
manner specified in such writing; (b) consent to Mortgagor&#146;s doing any act
which hereunder Mortgagor is prohibited from doing, or to Mortgagor&#146;s failing
to do any act which hereunder Mortgagor is required to do, to the extent and in
the manner specified in such writing; (c) release any part of the Property or
any interest therein from the lien and security interest of this Mortgage,
without the joinder of Mortgagee; or (d) release any party liable, either

Mortgagee in such writing.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.5. <U>No Impairment of Security</U>. The lien, security interest and other
security rights of Mortgagee hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
not be impaired by any indulgence, moratorium or release granted by Mortgagee
including, but not limited to, any renewal, extension or modification which
Mortgagee may grant with respect to any Secured Indebtedness, or any surrender,
compromise, release, renewal, extension, exchange or substitution which
Mortgagee may grant in respect of the Property, or any part thereof or any
interest therein, or any release or indulgence granted to any endorser,
guarantor or surety of any Secured Indebtedness. The taking of additional
security by Mortgagee shall not release or impair the lien, security interest
or other security rights of Mortgagee hereunder or affect the liability of
Mortgagor or of any endorser, guarantor or surety, or improve the right of any
junior lien Mortgagee in the Property (without implying hereby Mortgagee&#146;s
consent to any junior lien).</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.6. <U>Acts Not Constituting Waiver by Mortgagee</U>. Mortgagee may waive any
default without waiving any other prior or subsequent default. Mortgagee may
remedy any default without waiving the default remedied. Neither failure by
Mortgagee to exercise, nor delay by Mortgagee in exercising, nor discontinuance
of the exercise of any right, power or remedy (including but not limited to the
right to accelerate the maturity of the Secured Indebtedness or any part
thereof) upon or after any default shall be construed as a waiver of such default
or as a waiver of the right to exercise any such right, power or remedy at a
later date. No single or partial exercise by Mortgagee of any right, power or
remedy hereunder shall exhaust the same or shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof, and every such right, power or remedy hereunder may be
exercised at any time and from time to time. No modification or </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>waiver of any provision
hereof nor consent to any departure by Mortgagor therefrom shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Mortgagee and
then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance,
for the purpose for which given and to the extent therein specified. No notice
to nor demand on Mortgagor in any case shall of itself entitle Mortgagor to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Remittances in payment of any part of the Secured Indebtedness other than in
the required amount in immediately available U.S. funds shall not, regardless of
any receipt or credit issued therefor, constitute payment until the required
amount is actually received by Mortgagee in immediately available U.S. funds
and shall be made and accepted subject to the condition that any check or draft
may be handled for collection in accordance with the practice of the collecting
bank or banks. Acceptance by Mortgagee of any payment in an amount less than
the amount then due on any Secured Indebtedness shall be deemed an acceptance
on account only and shall not in any way excuse the existence of a default
hereunder notwithstanding any notation on or accompanying such partial payment
to the contrary.</FONT></P>

6.7. <U>Mortgagor&#146;s Successors</U>. If the ownership of the Property or any
part thereof becomes vested in a person other than Mortgagor, Mortgagee may,
without notice to Mortgagor, deal with such successor or successors in interest
with reference to this Mortgage and to the Secured Indebtedness in the same
manner as with Mortgagor, without in any way vitiating or discharging
Mortgagor&#146;s liability hereunder or for the payment of the indebtedness or
performance of the obligations secured hereby. No transfer of the Property, no
forbearance on the part of Mortgagee, and no extension of the time for the
payment of the Secured Indebtedness given by Mortgagee shall operate to
release, discharge, modify, change or affect, in whole or in part, the
liability of Mortgagor hereunder for the payment of the indebtedness or
performance of the obligations secured hereby or the liability of any other
person hereunder for the payment of the indebtedness secured hereby. Each
Mortgagor agrees that it shall be bound by any modification of this Mortgage or
any of the other Loan Documents made by Mortgagee and any subsequent owner of
the Property, with or without notice to such Mortgagor, and no such
modifications shall impair the obligations of such Mortgagor under this
Mortgage or any other Loan Document. Nothing in this Section or elsewhere in
this Mortgage shall be construed to imply Mortgagee&#146;s consent to any transfer
of the Property.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.8. <U>Place of Payment</U>. All Secured Indebtedness which may be owing
hereunder at any time by Mortgagor shall be payable at the place designated in
the Note (or if no such designation is made, at the address of Mortgagee
indicated at the end of this Mortgage). </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.9. <U>Subrogation to Existing Liens; Vendor&#146;s Lien</U>. To the extent that
proceeds of the Note are used to pay indebtedness secured by any outstanding
lien, security interest, charge or prior encumbrance against the Property, such
proceeds have been advanced by Mortgagee at Mortgagor&#146;s request, and Mortgagee
shall be subrogated to any and all rights, security interests and liens owned
by any owner or Mortgagee of such outstanding liens, security interests,
charges or encumbrances, however remote, irrespective of whether said liens,
security interests, charges or encumbrances are released, and all of the same
are recognized as valid and subsisting and are renewed and continued and merged
herein to secure the Secured Indebtedness, but the terms and provisions of this
Mortgage shall govern and control the manner and terms of enforcement of the
liens, security interests, charges and encumbrances to which Mortgagee is
subrogated hereunder. It is expressly understood that, in consideration of the
payment of such </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>indebtedness by
Mortgagee, Mortgagor hereby waives and releases all demands and causes of
action for offsets and payments in connection with the said indebtedness. If
all or any portion of the proceeds of the loan evidenced by the Note or of any
other secured indebtedness has been advanced for the purpose of paying the
purchase price for all or a part of the Property, no vendor&#146;s lien is waived;
and Mortgagee shall have, and is hereby granted, a vendor&#146;s lien on the
Property as cumulative additional security for the secured indebtedness.
Mortgagee may foreclose under this Mortgage or under the vendor&#146;s lien without
waiving the other or may foreclose under both.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.10. <U>Application of Payments to Certain Indebtedness</U>. If any part of
the Secured Indebtedness cannot be lawfully secured by this Mortgage or if any
part of the Property cannot be lawfully subject to the lien and security
interest hereof to the full extent of such indebtedness, then all payments made
shall be applied on said indebtedness first in discharge of that portion
thereof which is not secured by this Mortgage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.11. <U>Nature of Loan; Compliance with Usury Laws</U>. The loan evidenced by
the Note is being made solely for the purpose of carrying on or acquiring a
business or commercial enterprise. It is the intent of Mortgagor and Mortgagee
and all other parties to the Loan Documents to conform to and contract in
strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. All
agreements between Mortgagee and Mortgagor (or any other party liable with
respect to any indebtedness under the Loan Documents) are hereby limited by the
provisions of this Section which shall override and control all such
agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising. In no way, nor in any
event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment, default, demand
for payment, or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the interest
taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, chargeable, or received under this
Mortgage, the Note or any other Loan Document or otherwise, exceed the maximum
nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law (the &#147;Maximum Amount&#148;). If, from
any possible construction of any document, interest would otherwise be payable
in excess of the Maximum Amount, any such construction shall be subject to the
provisions of this Section and such document shall ipso facto be automatically
reformed and the interest payable shall be automatically reduced to the Maximum
Amount, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document. If
Mortgagee shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as
interest under applicable law and which would apart from this provision be in
excess of the Maximum Amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have
been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of
the principal amount owing on the Secured Indebtedness in the inverse order of
its maturity and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to Mortgagor or
the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been
excessive exceeds such unpaid principal. The right to accelerate maturity of
the Note or any other Secured Indebtedness does not include the right to
accelerate any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such
acceleration, and Mortgagee does not intend to charge or receive any unearned
interest in the event of acceleration. All interest paid or agreed to be paid
to Mortgagee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full stated term (including any
renewal or extension) of such indebtedness so that the amount of interest on
account of such indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Amount. As used in
this Section, the term &#147;applicable law&#148; shall mean the laws of the State of New
York or the federal laws of the United </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
<U>Release of Mortgage</U>. If all of the Secured Indebtedness is paid
as the same becomes due and payable and all of the covenants, warranties,
undertakings and agreements made in this Mortgage are kept and performed, and
all Swap Transactions and all other obligations, if any, of Mortgagee for
further advances have been terminated, then, and in that event only, all rights
under this Mortgage shall terminate (except to the extent expressly provided
herein with respect to indemnifications, representations and warranties and
other rights which are to continue following the release hereof) and the Property
shall become wholly clear of the liens, security interests, conveyances and
assignments evidenced hereby, and such liens and security interests shall be
released by Mortgagee in due form at Mortgagor&#146;s cost. Without limitation, all
provisions herein for indemnity of Mortgagee or Mortgagee shall survive
discharge of the Secured Indebtedness, the termination of any and all Swap
Transactions and any foreclosure, release or termination of this Mortgage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<U>Partial Releases; No Release in Default</U>. Partial releases of the
lien of this Mortgage shall be made in accordance with the terms and provisions
of <U>Exhibit C</U> attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof,
or in accordance with such other terms and conditions as may subsequently be
agreed to by Mortgagee. If no such <U>Exhibit C</U> is attached hereto, then
there are no terms and provisions for partial releases, to which Mortgagee and
Mortgagor have agreed at this time. In any event, no partial release shall be
sought, requested or required if any Default has occurred which has not been
cured.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
<U>Effect of Partial Release</U>. Mortgagee may, regardless of
consideration, cause the release of any part of the Property from the lien of
this Mortgage without in any manner affecting or impairing the lien or priority
of this Mortgage as to the remainder of the Property.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
<U>Release Fee</U>. If permitted by applicable law Mortgagor shall pay
to Mortgagee, at the time of each partial or complete release of the lien of
this Mortgage, a release fee in the amount of $25.00 if the release instrument
is delivered to Mortgagee for execution or $50.00, if Mortgagee is required to
prepare the release instrument. In addition, Mortgagor shall pay to Mortgagee a
fee in the amount of $25.00 for each other document or instrument which
Mortgagor requires Mortgagee to execute.</FONT></P>

provided in such other Loan Document, shall be deemed sufficiently given or

provision of this Mortgage is unenforceable or invalid shall not affect the
enforceability or validity of any other provision and the determination that
the application of any provision of this Mortgage to any person or circumstance
is illegal or unenforceable shall not affect the enforceability or validity of

the singular number shall be held and construed to include the plural, unless
the context otherwise requires. Titles appearing at the beginning of any

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
2.1. Mortgagor represents, warrants, and covenants as follows:</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
<U>Payment and Performance</U>. Mortgagor will make due and punctual
payment of the Secured Indebtedness. Mortgagor will timely and properly perform
and comply with all of the covenants, agreements, and conditions imposed upon
it by this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents and will not permit a default
to occur hereunder or thereunder. Time shall be of the essence in this
Mortgage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<U>Title and Permitted Encumbrances</U>. Mortgagor has, in Mortgagor&#146;s
own right, and Mortgagor covenants to maintain, lawful, good and marketable title
to the Property, is lawfully seized and possessed of the Property and every
part thereof, and has the right to convey the same, free and clear of all
liens, charges, claims, security interests, and encumbrances except for (i) the
matters, if any, set forth under the heading &#147;Permitted Encumbrances&#148; in <U>Exhibit
B</U> hereto,</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2>5</FONT></P>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="100%" SIZE=4><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE='PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: ALWAYS'></P><PAGE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>which are Permitted
Encumbrances only to the extent the same are valid and subsisting and affect
the Property, (ii) the liens and security interests evidenced by this Mortgage,
(iii) statutory liens for real estate taxes and assessments on the Property
which are not yet delinquent, and (iv) other liens and security interests (if
any) in favor of Mortgagee (the matters described in the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) being herein called the &#147;Permitted Encumbrances&#148;).
Mortgagor owns and holds the Fee Parcel in fee simple absolute. Mortgagor is
the owner of a valid and subsisting interest as tenant under the Ground Lease,
that the Ground Lease is in full force and effect, there are no defaults
thereunder and no event has occurred or is occurring which after notice or
passage of time or both will result in such a default, that the Ground Lease is
subject to no lien, charge or encumbrance of any kind and is prior to all
liens, charges and encumbrances whatsoever on the fee interest of the lessor
thereunder except such as are listed as exceptions to title in the title policy
insuring the lien hereof. Mortgagor, and Mortgagor&#146;s successors and assigns,
will warrant generally and forever defend title to the Property, subject as
aforesaid, to Mortgagee and his successors or substitutes and assigns, against
the claims and demands of all persons claiming or to claim the same or any part
thereof. Mortgagor will preserve the leasehold estate created in it by the
Ground Lease, and will forever warrant and defend the same to Mortgagee and
will forever warrant and defend the validity and priority of the lien hereof
against the claims of all persons and parties whomsoever. Mortgagor will perform
or cause to be performed all of the covenants and conditions required to be
performed by it under the Ground Lease, will do all things necessary to
preserve unimpaired its rights thereunder, and will not enter into any
agreement modifying or amending the Ground Lease or releasing the lessor
thereunder from any obligations imposed upon it thereby. If Mortgagor receives
a notice of default under the Ground Lease, it shall immediately cause a copy
of such notice to be sent by registered United States mail to Mortgagee.
Mortgagor will punctually pay, perform, observe and keep all covenants,
obligations and conditions in or pursuant to any Permitted Encumbrance and will
not modify or permit modification of any Permitted Encumbrance without the
prior written consent of Mortgagee. Inclusion of any matter as a Permitted
Encumbrance does not constitute approval or waiver by Mortgagee of any existing
or future violation or other breach thereof by Mortgagor, by the Property or
otherwise. No part of the Property constitutes all or any part of the principal
residence of Mortgagor if Mortgagor is an individual. If any right or interest
of Mortgagee in the Property or any part thereof shall be endangered or
questioned or shall be attacked directly or indirectly, Mortgagee and
Mortgagee, or either of them (whether or not named as parties to legal
proceedings with respect thereto), are hereby authorized and empowered to take
such steps as in their discretion may be proper for the defense of any such
legal proceedings or the protection of such right or interest of Mortgagee,
including but not limited to the employment of independent counsel, the
prosecution or defense of litigation, and the compromise or discharge of
adverse claims. All expenditures so made of every kind and character shall be a
demand obligation (which obligation Mortgagor hereby promises to pay) owing by
Mortgagor to Mortgagee or Mortgagee (as the case may be), and the party
(Mortgagee or Mortgagee, as the case may be) making such expenditures shall be
subrogated to all rights of the person receiving such payment.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)

other insurance that may be carried by Mortgagor or Mortgagee and that all of

insurer which has issued a policy of title, hazard, liability or other
insurance required pursuant to this Mortgage or any other Loan Document becomes
insolvent or the subject of any petition, case, proceeding or other action
pursuant to any Debtor Relief Law, or if in Mortgagee&#146;s reasonable opinion the

of Mortgagee therefor, and at Mortgagor&#146;s expense, promptly obtain and deliver
to Mortgagee a like policy (or, if and to the extent permitted by Mortgagee,
acceptable evidence of insurance) issued by another insurer, which insurer and

the case may be. Without limiting the discretion of Mortgagee with respect to
required endorsements to insurance policies, all such policies for loss of or

naming Mortgagee as mortgagee with loss proceeds payable to Mortgagee
notwithstanding (i) any act, failure to act or negligence of or violation of

purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms of any such policy; (iii)

originals of each initial insurance policy (or to the extent permitted by
Mortgagee, a copy of the original policy and such evidence of insurance
acceptable to Mortgagee) shall be delivered to Mortgagee at the time of
execution of this Mortgage, with all premiums fully paid current, and each
renewal or substitute policy (or evidence of insurance) shall be delivered to
Mortgagee, with all premiums fully paid current, at least ten (10) days before
the termination of the policy it renews or replaces. Mortgagor shall pay all

Mortgagee. Upon any foreclosure hereof or transfer of title to the Property in
extinguishment of the whole or any part of the Secured Indebtedness, all of
Mortgagor&#146;s right, title and interest in and to the insurance policies referred
to in this Section (including unearned premiums) and all proceeds payable
thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at foreclosure or other such

$1,000,000 or more, regardless of whether or not such insurance policies are
required by Mortgagee, and the expenses incurred by Mortgagee in the adjustment

incurred by it in the collection of such proceeds and (ii) second to

Mortgagor in restoring the Property and shall be approved by Mortgagee.
Insurance proceeds shall be applied to such restoration solely if (A) Mortgagee
determines that: (i) the Property is capable of being suitably restored in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements to the value, condition,
character and general utility existing prior to such damage or destruction,
and, in any event, to a Loan to Value Ratio of not greater than 70%, provided
that this clause (i) shall not apply to insurance proceeds relating to a
casualty for which the gross insurance proceeds do not exceed $1,000,000; (ii) sufficient
funds are unconditionally available (from proceeds of insurance and/or from
funds of Mortgagor) to enable Mortgagor promptly to commence, and thereafter
diligently to prosecute to completion, such restoration, provided that this
clause (ii) shall not apply to insurance proceeds relating to a casualty for
which the gross insurance proceeds do not exceed $1,000,000; (iii) Mortgagor is
not in default or in breach of any obligations under any Loan Document, no
uncured Default exists under any Loan Document and no facts or circumstances
exist that would constitute a Default with the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both; and (iv) neither the validity, enforceability nor priority of
the lien of this Mortgage shall be adversely affected; (B) Mortgagor has
entered into a written agreement, satisfactory in form and substance to
Mortgagee, containing such conditions to disbursements as are employed at the
time by Mortgagee for construction loans; (C) Mortgagor has delivered to
Mortgagee such security as Mortgagee might have reasonably required to assure
completion of restoration in accordance with the standards specified above; and

doing shall be subrogated to any and all rights of the Ground Lessor. Mortgagor

of any notice of default sent by said Ground Lessor to Mortgagor, as tenant
under the Ground Lease, such notice shall constitute full protection to
Mortgagee for any action taken or omitted to be taken by Mortgagee, in good

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
3.1. <U>Assignment</U>. Mortgagor hereby assigns to Mortgagee all Rents
(hereinafter defined) and all of Mortgagor&#146;s rights in and under all Leases
(hereinafter defined). So long as no Default (hereinafter defined) has
occurred, Mortgagor shall have a license (which license shall terminate
automatically and without further notice upon the occurrence of a Default) to
collect, but not prior to accrual, the Rents under the Leases and, where
applicable, subleases, such Rents to be held in trust for Mortgagee, and to
otherwise deal with all Leases as permitted by this Mortgage. Each month,
provided no Default has occurred, Mortgagor may retain such Rents as were
collected that month and held in trust for Mortgagee; provided, however, that
all Rents collected by Mortgagor shall be applied solely to the ordinary and
necessary expenses of owning and operating the Property or paid to Mortgagee.
Upon the revocation of such license, all Rents shall be paid directly to
Mortgagee and not through Mortgagor, all without the necessity of any further
action by Mortgagee, including, without limitation, any action to obtain
possession of the Land, Improvements or any other portion of the Property or
any action for the appointment of a receiver. Mortgagor hereby authorizes and
directs the tenants under the Leases to pay Rents to Mortgagee upon written
demand by Mortgagee, without further consent of Mortgagor, without any
obligation of such tenants to determine whether a Default has in fact occurred
and regardless of whether Mortgagee has taken possession of any portion of the
Property, and the tenants may rely upon any written statement delivered by
Mortgagee to the tenants. Any such payments to Mortgagee shall constitute
payments to Mortgagor under the Leases, and Mortgagor hereby irrevocably
appoints Mortgagee as its attorney-in-fact to do all things, after a Default,
which Mortgagor might otherwise do with respect to the Property and the Leases
thereon, including, without limitation, (i) collecting Rents with or without
suit and applying the same, less expenses of collection, to any of the
obligations secured hereunder or to expenses of operating and maintaining the
Property (including reasonable reserves for anticipated expenses), at the
option of Mortgagee, all in such manner as may be determined by Mortgagee, or
at the option of Mortgagee, holding the same as security for </FONT></P>

Secured Indebtedness, (ii) leasing, in the name of Mortgagor, the whole or any
part of the Property which may become vacant, and (iii) employing agents
therefor and paying such agents reasonable compensation for their services. The
curing of such Default, unless other Defaults also then exist, shall entitle
Mortgagor to recover its aforesaid license to do any such things which
Mortgagor might otherwise do with respect to the Property and the Leases
thereon and to again collect such Rents. The powers and rights granted in this
paragraph shall be in addition to the other remedies herein provided for upon
the occurrence of a Default and may be exercised independently of or
concurrently with any of said remedies. Nothing in the foregoing shall be
construed to impose any obligation upon Mortgagee to exercise any power or
right granted in this paragraph or to assume any liability under any Lease of
any part of the Property and no liability shall attach to Mortgagee for failure
or inability to collect any Rents under any such Lease. The assignment
contained in this Section shall become null and void upon the release of this
Mortgage. As used herein: (i) &#147;Lease&#148; means each existing or future lease,
sublease (to the extent of Mortgagor&#146;s rights thereunder) or other agreement

the Property, or any part thereof, or interest therein, and each existing or

agreement or guaranty; and (ii) &#147;Rents&#148; means all of the rents, revenue,
income, profits and proceeds derived and to be derived from the Property or
arising from the use or enjoyment of any portion thereof or from any Lease,
including but not limited to the proceeds from any negotiated lease termination
or buyout of such Lease, liquidated damages following default under any such
Lease, all proceeds payable under any policy of insurance covering loss of
rents resulting from untenantability caused by damage to any part of the
Property, all of Mortgagor&#146;s rights to recover monetary amounts from any tenant
in bankruptcy including, without limitation, rights of recovery for use and
occupancy and damage claims arising out of Lease defaults, including
rejections, under any applicable Debtor Relief Law (hereinafter defined),

overriding royalties, bonuses, delay rentals and any other amount of any kind

time by a specific writing intended for the purpose: (a) waive compliance by
Mortgagor with any covenant herein made by Mortgagor to the extent and in the
manner specified in such writing; (b) consent to Mortgagor&#146;s doing any act
which hereunder Mortgagor is prohibited from doing, or to Mortgagor&#146;s failing
to do any act which hereunder Mortgagor is required to do, to the extent and in
the manner specified in such writing; (c) release any part of the Property or
any interest therein from the lien and security interest of this Mortgage,
without the joinder of Mortgagee; or (d) release any party liable, either
directly or indirectly, for the Secured Indebtedness or for any covenant herein
or in any other Loan Document, without impairing or releasing the liability of

Mortgagee in such writing.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.5. <U>No Impairment of Security</U>. The lien, security interest and other
security rights of Mortgagee hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
not be impaired by any indulgence, moratorium or release granted by Mortgagee
including, but not limited to, any renewal, extension or modification which
Mortgagee may grant with respect to any Secured Indebtedness, or any surrender,
compromise, release, renewal, extension, exchange or substitution which
Mortgagee may grant in respect of the Property, or any part thereof or any
interest therein, or any release or indulgence granted to any endorser,
guarantor or surety of any Secured Indebtedness. The taking of additional
security by Mortgagee shall not release or impair the lien, security interest
or other security rights of Mortgagee hereunder or affect the liability of
Mortgagor or of any endorser, guarantor or surety, or improve the right of any
junior lien Mortgagee in the Property (without implying hereby Mortgagee&#146;s
consent to any junior lien).</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.6. <U>Acts Not Constituting Waiver by Mortgagee</U>. Mortgagee may waive any
default without waiving any other prior or subsequent default. Mortgagee may
remedy any default without waiving the default remedied. Neither failure by
Mortgagee to exercise, nor delay by Mortgagee in exercising, nor discontinuance
of the exercise of any right, power or remedy (including but not limited to the
right to accelerate the maturity of the Secured Indebtedness or any part
thereof) upon or after any default shall be construed as a waiver of such
default or as a waiver of the right to exercise any such right, power or remedy
at a later date. No single or partial exercise by Mortgagee of any right, power
or remedy hereunder shall exhaust the same or shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof, and every such right, power or remedy hereunder may
be exercised at any time and from time to time. No modification or </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>waiver of any provision
hereof nor consent to any departure by Mortgagor therefrom shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Mortgagee and
then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance,
for the purpose for which given and to the extent therein specified. No notice
to nor demand on Mortgagor in any case shall of itself entitle Mortgagor to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Remittances in payment of any part of the Secured Indebtedness other than in
the required amount in immediately available U.S. funds shall not, regardless
of any receipt or credit issued therefor, constitute payment until the required
amount is actually received by Mortgagee in immediately available U.S. funds
and shall be made and accepted subject to the condition that any check or draft
may be handled for collection in accordance with the practice of the collecting
bank or banks. Acceptance by Mortgagee of any payment in an amount less than
the amount then due on any Secured Indebtedness shall be deemed an acceptance
on account only and shall not in any way excuse the existence of a default
hereunder notwithstanding any notation on or accompanying such partial payment
to the contrary.</FONT></P>

6.7. <U>Mortgagor&#146;s Successors</U>. If the ownership of the Property or any
part thereof becomes vested in a person other than Mortgagor, Mortgagee may,
without notice to Mortgagor, deal with such successor or successors in interest
with reference to this Mortgage and to the Secured Indebtedness in the same
manner as with Mortgagor, without in any way vitiating or discharging
Mortgagor&#146;s liability hereunder or for the payment of the indebtedness or
performance of the obligations secured hereby. No transfer of the Property, no
forbearance on the part of Mortgagee, and no extension of the time for the
payment of the Secured Indebtedness given by Mortgagee shall operate to
release, discharge, modify, change or affect, in whole or in part, the
liability of Mortgagor hereunder for the payment of the indebtedness or
performance of the obligations secured hereby or the liability of any other
person hereunder for the payment of the indebtedness secured hereby. Each
Mortgagor agrees that it shall be bound by any modification of this Mortgage or
any of the other Loan Documents made by Mortgagee and any subsequent owner of
the Property, with or without notice to such Mortgagor, and no such
modifications shall impair the obligations of such Mortgagor under this
Mortgage or any other Loan Document. Nothing in this Section or elsewhere in
this Mortgage shall be construed to imply Mortgagee&#146;s consent to any transfer
of the Property.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.8. <U>Place of Payment</U>. All Secured Indebtedness which may be owing
hereunder at any time by Mortgagor shall be payable at the place designated in
the Note (or if no such designation is made, at the address of Mortgagee
indicated at the end of this Mortgage). </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6.9. <U>Subrogation
to Existing Liens; Vendor&#146;s Lien</U>. To the extent that proceeds of the Note
are used to pay indebtedness secured by any outstanding lien, security
interest, charge or prior encumbrance against the Property, such proceeds have
been advanced by Mortgagee at Mortgagor&#146;s request, and Mortgagee shall be
subrogated to any and all rights, security interests and liens owned by any
owner or Mortgagee of such outstanding liens, security interests, charges or
encumbrances, however remote, irrespective of whether said liens, security
interests, charges or encumbrances are released, and all of the same are
recognized as valid and subsisting and are renewed and continued and merged
herein to secure the Secured Indebtedness, but the terms and provisions of this
Mortgage shall govern and control the manner and terms of enforcement of the
liens, security interests, charges and encumbrances to which Mortgagee is
subrogated hereunder. It is expressly understood that, in consideration of the
payment of such </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>indebtedness by
Mortgagee, Mortgagor hereby waives and releases all demands and causes of
action for offsets and payments in connection with the said indebtedness. If
all or any portion of the proceeds of the loan evidenced by the Note or of any
other secured indebtedness has been advanced for the purpose of paying the
purchase price for all or a part of the Property, no vendor&#146;s lien is waived;
and Mortgagee shall have, and is hereby granted, a vendor&#146;s lien on the
Property as cumulative additional security for the secured indebtedness.
Mortgagee may foreclose under this Mortgage or under the vendor&#146;s lien without
waiving the other or may foreclose under both.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.10. <U>Application of Payments to Certain Indebtedness</U>. If any part of
the Secured Indebtedness cannot be lawfully secured by this Mortgage or if any
part of the Property cannot be lawfully subject to the lien and security
interest hereof to the full extent of such indebtedness, then all payments made
shall be applied on said indebtedness first in discharge of that portion
thereof which is not secured by this Mortgage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.11. <U>Nature of Loan; Compliance with Usury Laws</U>. The loan evidenced by
the Note is being made solely for the purpose of carrying on or acquiring a
business or commercial enterprise. It is the intent of Mortgagor and Mortgagee
and all other parties to the Loan Documents to conform to and contract in
strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. All
agreements between Mortgagee and Mortgagor (or any other party liable with
respect to any indebtedness under the Loan Documents) are hereby limited by the
provisions of this Section which shall override and control all such
agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising. In no way, nor in any
event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment, default, demand
for payment, or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the
interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, chargeable, or received
under this Mortgage, the Note or any other Loan Document or otherwise, exceed
the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law (the &#147;Maximum
Amount&#148;). If, from any possible construction of any document, interest would
otherwise be payable in excess of the Maximum Amount, any such construction
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and such document shall ipso
facto be automatically reformed and the interest payable shall be automatically
reduced to the Maximum Amount, without the necessity of execution of any
amendment or new document. If Mortgagee shall ever receive anything of value
which is characterized as interest under applicable law and which would apart
from this provision be in excess of the Maximum Amount, an amount equal to the
amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be
applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Secured
Indebtedness in the inverse order of its maturity and not to the payment of
interest, or refunded to Mortgagor or the other payor thereof if and to the
extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid
principal. The right to accelerate maturity of the Note or any other Secured
Indebtedness does not include the right to accelerate any interest which has
not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and Mortgagee does not
intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of acceleration.
All interest paid or agreed to be paid to Mortgagee shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of such
indebtedness so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness
does not exceed the Maximum Amount. As used in this Section, the term
&#147;applicable law&#148; shall mean the laws of the State of New York or the federal
laws of the United </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
<U>Release of Mortgage</U>. If all of the Secured Indebtedness is paid
as the same becomes due and payable and all of the covenants, warranties,
undertakings and agreements made in this Mortgage are kept and performed, and
all Swap Transactions and all other obligations, if any, of Mortgagee for
further advances have been terminated, then, and in that event only, all rights
under this Mortgage shall terminate (except to the extent expressly provided
herein with respect to indemnifications, representations and warranties and
other rights which are to continue following the release hereof) and the
Property shall become wholly clear of the liens, security interests,
conveyances and assignments evidenced hereby, and such liens and security
interests shall be released by Mortgagee in due form at Mortgagor&#146;s cost.
Without limitation, all provisions herein for indemnity of Mortgagee or
Mortgagee shall survive discharge of the Secured Indebtedness, the termination
of any and all Swap Transactions and any foreclosure, release or termination of
this Mortgage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<U>Partial Releases; No Release in Default</U>. Partial releases of the
lien of this Mortgage shall be made in accordance with the terms and provisions
of <U>Exhibit C</U> attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof,
or in accordance with such other terms and conditions as may subsequently be
agreed to by Mortgagee. If no such <U>Exhibit C</U> is attached hereto, then
there are no terms and provisions for partial releases, to which Mortgagee and
Mortgagor have agreed at this time. In any event, no partial release shall be
sought, requested or required if any Default has occurred which has not been
cured.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
<U>Effect of Partial Release</U>. Mortgagee may, regardless of

this Mortgage without in any manner affecting or impairing the lien or priority
of this Mortgage as to the remainder of the Property.</FONT></P>

<U>Release Fee</U>. If permitted by applicable law Mortgagor shall pay
to Mortgagee, at the time of each partial or complete release of the lien of
this Mortgage, a release fee in the amount of $25.00 if the release instrument
is delivered to Mortgagee for execution or $50.00, if Mortgagee is required to
prepare the release instrument. In addition, Mortgagor shall pay to Mortgagee a
fee in the amount of $25.00 for each other document or instrument which
Mortgagor requires Mortgagee to execute.</FONT></P>

Coverage Ratio (as hereinafter defined) of at least 1.43 to 1.0, then, on the
further condition that no Default then exists, the Initial PL Amount shall be
reduced to zero. As used herein, the term &#147;Additional PL Amount&#148; shall mean an

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a foreclosure sale, Guarantor agrees that Guarantor&#146;s

(x) the unpaid principal amount of the Loan, (y) costs and expenses of such
sale and (z) the amount of any taxes or assessments or any similar charges paid

Guarantor at any time or limit Administrative Agent&#146;s right to proceed against
Guarantor at any time or from time to time for principal, interest, default
interest and late charges guaranteed hereby which are not paid as and when the
