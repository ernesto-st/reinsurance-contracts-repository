<PAGE>
                                       23

Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the Termination
Date (i) in an amount for each such Advance not to exceed such Lender's Unused
Revolving Credit Commitment at such time and (ii) in an aggregate amount for all
revolving Credit Advances outstanding at any one time not to exceed an amount
equal to (A) the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of all Revolving Credit
Lenders, minus (B) the aggregate Swing Line Advances, minus (C) the aggregate
Available Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, in each case at such
time. Each Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of
$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (other than a
Borrowing the proceeds of which shall be used solely to repay or prepay in full
outstanding Swing Line Advances or outstanding Letter of Credit Advances) and
shall consist of Revolving Credit Advances made simultaneously by the Revolving
Credit Lenders ratably according to their Revolving Credit Commitments. Within
the limits of each Revolving Credit Lender's Unused Revolving Credit Commitment
in effect from time to time, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(a),
prepay pursuant to Section 2.06(a) and reborrow under this Section 2.01(a).

                (b)     The Swing Line Advances. Subject to other arrangements
as referred to in Section 2.02(b)(i), the Borrower may request the Swing Line
Bank to make, and the Swing Line Bank may, if in its sole discretion it elects
to do so, make, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, Swing Line
Advances to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period

not to exceed at any time outstanding $20,000,000 (the "SWING LINE FACILITY")
and (ii) in an amount not at any time exceeding the amount of the then
applicable Swing Line Reserve. No Swing Line Advance shall be used for the
purpose of funding the payment of principal of any other Swing Line Advance.
Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be in minimum amounts and in multiples as agreed
between the Borrower and the Swing Line Bank and shall be made as a Base Rate
Advance. Within the limits of the Swing Line Facility and within the limits
referred to in clause (ii) above, so long as the Swing Line Bank, in its sole
discretion, elects to make Swing Line Advances, the Borrower may borrow under
this Section 2.01(b), repay pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or prepay pursuant to
Section 2.06(a) and reborrow under this Section 2.01(b).

                (c)     The Letters of Credit. Each Issuing Bank severally
agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to issue (or cause
its Affiliate that is a commercial bank to issue on its behalf) letters of
credit for the account of the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day
during the period from the Effective Date until 60 days before the Termination
Date in an aggregate Available Amount (i) for each such Letter of Credit,
together with all other Letters of Credit not to exceed at any time the Letter
of Credit Facility at such time and (ii) for each such Letter of Credit not to
exceed at any time the lesser of (x) such Issuing Bank's Letter of Credit
Commitment at such time and (y) the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments of the
Revolving Credit Lenders at such time. It is understood and agreed that the
Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued
hereunder for all purposes under this Agreement and the Loan Documents and
Harris Bank shall be deemed an Issuing Bank for all purposes under this
Agreement and the Loan Documents. No Letter of Credit shall have an expiration
date (including all rights of the Borrower or the beneficiary to require
renewal) later than the earlier of 60 days before the Termination Date and (A)
in the case of a Standby Letter of Credit, one year after the date of issuance
thereof, but may by its terms be renewable annually upon notice (a "NOTICE OF
RENEWAL") given to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent on or prior to
any date for notice of renewal set forth in such Letter of Credit but in any
event at least ten Business Days prior to the date of the proposed renewal of
such Standby Letter of Credit and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions
set forth in Article III unless such Issuing Bank has notified the Borrower
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date for notice of
termination set forth in such Letter of Credit but in any event at least ten
Business Days prior to the then effective expiration date of its election not to
renew such Standby Letter of Credit (a "NOTICE OF TERMINATION"; it being
understood and agreed that an Issuing Bank shall not be entitled to issue a
Notice of Termination with respect to such a renewal unless (i) the conditions
precedent to the issuance of Letters of Credit set forth in Section 3.02 shall
not have

                                       24

been fulfilled or waived in accordance herewith, or (ii) a Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, or (iii) pursuant to such renewal the effective
expiration date of such Letter of Credit would occur after the Termination Date
or (iv) such Issuing Bank shall have procured a replacement Issuing Bank) and
(B) in the case of a Trade Letter of Credit, 60 days after the date of issuance
thereof; provided that the terms of each Standby Letter of Credit that is
renewable annually shall (x) require the Issuing Bank that issued such Standby
Letter of Credit to give the beneficiary named in such Standby Letter of Credit
notice of any Notice of Termination, (y) permit such beneficiary, upon receipt
of such notice, to draw under such Standby Letter of Credit prior to the date
such Standby Letter of Credit otherwise would have been automatically renewed
and (z) not permit the expiration date (after giving effect to any renewal) of
such Standby Letter of Credit in any event to be extended to a date later than
60 days before the Termination Date. If either a Notice of Renewal is not given
by the Borrower or a Notice of Termination is given by the relevant Issuing Bank
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, such Standby Letter of Credit
shall expire on the date on which it otherwise would have been renewed;
provided, however, that even in the absence of receipt of a Notice of Renewal
the relevant Issuing Bank may in its discretion, unless instructed to the
contrary by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, deem that a Notice of
Renewal had been timely delivered and in such case, a Notice of Renewal shall be
deemed to have been so delivered for all purposes under this Agreement. Each
Standby Letter of Credit shall contain a provision authorizing the Issuing Bank
thereunder to deliver to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, a notice (a
"DEFAULT TERMINATION NOTICE") terminating such Letter of Credit and giving such
beneficiary 15 days to draw such Letter of Credit. Within the limits of the
Letter of Credit Facility, and subject to the limits referred to above, the
Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit under this Section
2.01(c), repay any Letter of Credit Advances resulting from drawings thereunder
pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and request the issuance of additional Letters of
Credit under this Section 2.01(c).

                SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances. (b) Except as otherwise
provided in Section 2.02(b) or 2.03, each Borrowing shall be made on notice,
given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day
prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing
consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, or the first Business Day prior to the
date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base
Rate Advances, by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, which shall give to
each Appropriate Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or telecopier. Each such
notice of a Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF BORROWING") shall be in writing or by
telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex or telecopier, in
substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i)
date of such Borrowing, (ii) Facility under which such Borrowing is to be made,
(iii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iv) aggregate amount of such
Borrowing and (v) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each Appropriate Lender
shall, before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing,
make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds,
such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing in accordance with the
respective Commitments under the applicable Facility of such Lender and the
other Appropriate Lenders. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such
funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article
III, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower by
crediting the Borrower's Account; provided, however, that, in the case of any
Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall first make a portion
of such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of any Swing Line Advances
and Letter of Credit Advances made by the Swing Line Bank or any Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, and by any other Revolving Credit Lender and outstanding on
the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid
thereon to and as of such date, available to the Swing Line Bank or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, and such other Revolving Credit Lenders for repayment
of such Swing Line Advances and Letter of Credit Advances.

                (b)     (i) Swing Line Borrowings may be made either upon notice
as set forth in Section 2.02(b)(ii) below or pursuant to this Section 2.02(b)(i)
on a daily basis under mechanics mutually agreed to by the Borrower and the
Swing Line Bank, subject in any case to the fulfillment of the applicable
conditions precedent set forth in Article III hereof. The Swing Line Reserve at
any time shall be the amount most recently established by the Borrower by
written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger confirmed in
writing by the Swing Line Bank as the maximum aggregate principal amount of
Swing Line Borrowings to be outstanding at any one time (the "SWING LINE
RESERVE"), provided that in no event shall the Swing Line Reserve exceed
$20,000,000 at any time. Swing Line Advances made pursuant to this Section
2.02(b)(i) shall be made without any requirement for a prior written or
telephonic request given to the Administrative Agent. The Swing Line Bank will
notify the Administrative Agent, on a monthly basis, of any Swing Line Advances
so made. The Swing Line Bank shall not at any time permit the aggregate
outstanding amount of the Swing Line Advances to exceed the then applicable
amount of the Swing Line Reserve.

                (ii)    Each Swing Line Borrowing, if not made in accordance
with Section 2.02(b)(i) above, shall be made on notice, given not later than
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Swing Line
Borrowing, by the Borrower to the Swing Line Bank and the Administrative Agent.
Each such notice of a Swing Line Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF SWING LINE BORROWING")
shall be in writing or by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex
or telecopier, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii)
amount of such Borrowing and (iii) maturity of such Borrowing (which maturity
shall be no later than the seventh day after the requested date of such
Borrowing). If, in its sole discretion, it elects to make the requested Swing
Line Advance, the Swing Line Bank will make the amount thereof available to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds.
After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of
the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Administrative Agent
will make such funds available to the Borrower by crediting the Borrower's
Account.

                (iii)   Upon written demand by the Swing Line Bank, with a copy
of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each other Revolving Credit Lender
shall purchase from the Swing Line Bank, and the Swing Line Bank shall sell and
assign to each such other Revolving Credit Lender, such other Lender's Pro Rata
Share of such outstanding Swing Line Advance as of the date of such demand, by
making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Bank, by deposit to the
Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the
portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line Advance to be
purchased by such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and
assignment, and all parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the obligations of
such other Revolving Credit Lenders to purchase outstanding Swing Line Advances
is absolute and unconditional under all circumstances, and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, the
termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments or any other circumstances. Each
Revolving Credit Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding
Swing Line Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by
the Swing Line Bank, provided that notice of such demand is given not later than
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day or (ii) the first Business
Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such
time. Upon any such assignment by the Swing Line Bank to any other Revolving
Credit Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, the Swing Line Bank
represents and warrants to such other Lender that the Swing Line Bank is the
legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes no
other representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to
such Swing Line Advance, the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the
extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have so made the amount of
such Swing Line Advance available to the Administrative Agent, or if the Swing
Line Lender must disgorge or return any amounts paid by the Borrower in respect
thereof, such Revolving Credit Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Swing Line Bank forthwith on demand such amount

<PAGE>
                                       26

together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by the
Swing Line Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent,
at the Base Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such
amount for the account of the Swing Line Bank on any Business Day, such amount
so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by
such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the
outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by the Swing Line
Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

                (c)     Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for
the initial Borrowing hereunder and for five days after the Effective Date (or
such earlier date as shall be specified in its sole discretion by the Lead
Arranger in a written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) or
for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than
$5,000,000 or if the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make Eurodollar
Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.09 or 2.10 and (ii)
the Revolving Credit Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than twelve
separate Borrowings.

                (d)     Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Swing Line
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any
Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Appropriate Lender
against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any
failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing
for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III,
including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits),
cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made
by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such
failure, is not made on such date.

                (e)     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from an Appropriate Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing under a
Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not
have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay or pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount and to pay interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until
the date such amount is repaid or paid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in
the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at such time under
Section 2.07 to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such
Lender, the Base Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Advance
as part of such Borrowing for all purposes.

                (f)     The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made
by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing,
but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

                SECTION 2.03. Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under
Letters of Credit. (a) Request for Issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be
issued upon notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
fifth Business Day prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of
Credit, by the Borrower to any Issuing Bank, which shall give to the
Administrative Agent and

<PAGE>
                                       27

each Revolving Credit Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or telecopier or
other writing. Each such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "NOTICE OF
ISSUANCE") shall be in writing or by telephone, confirmed immediately in
writing, or telex or telecopier, specifying therein the requested (i) date of
such issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) Available Amount of such
Letter of Credit, (iii) expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (iv) name and
address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (v) form of such Letter
of Credit, and shall be accompanied by such application and agreement for letter
of credit as such Issuing Bank may specify to the Borrower for use in connection
with such requested Letter of Credit (a "LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT"). If (x)
the requested form of such Letter of Credit is acceptable to such Issuing Bank
in its sole discretion and (y) it has not received notice of objection to such
issuance from Lenders holding at least a majority of the Revolving Credit
Commitments, such Issuing Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable
conditions set forth in Article III, make such Letter of Credit available to the
Borrower at its office referred to in Section 8.02 or as otherwise agreed with
the Borrower in connection with such issuance. In the event and to the extent
that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.

                (b)     Letter of Credit Reports. Each Issuing Bank shall
furnish (i) to the Administrative Agent on or about the first Business Day of
each week a written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters
of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the previous week and drawings
during such week under all Letters of Credit, (ii) to each Revolving Credit
Lender on or about the first Business Day of each month a written report
summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank during the preceding month and drawings during such month under all
such Letters of Credit and (iii) to the Administrative Agent and each Revolving
Credit Lender on or about the first Business Day of each calendar quarter a
written report setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount during
the preceding calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank.

                (c)     Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by any Issuing
Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all
purposes of this Agreement the making by such Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit
Advance, which shall be a Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft. Upon
written demand by any Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent, each Revolving Credit Lender shall purchase from such
Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall sell and assign to each such Revolving
Credit Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Letter of Credit
Advance as of the date of such purchase, by making available for the account of
its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day
funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of
such Letter of Credit Advance to be purchased by such Lender. Promptly after
receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent shall transfer such funds to such
Issuing Bank. The Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment, and
all parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the obligations of such other
Revolving Credit Lenders to purchase outstanding Letter of Credit Advances is
absolute and unconditional under all circumstances, and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, the
termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments or any other circumstances. Each
Revolving Credit Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding
Letter of Credit Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is
made by the applicable Issuing Bank, provided that notice of such demand is
given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day, or
(ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand
is given after such time. Upon any such assignment by an Issuing Bank to any
Revolving Credit Lender of a portion of a Letter of Credit Advance, such Issuing
Bank represents and warrants to such other Lender that such Issuing Bank is the
legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, free and clear
of any liens, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to such Letter of Credit Advance, the Loan Documents
or any

<PAGE>
                                       28

Loan Party. If and to the extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have
so made the amount of such Letter of Credit Advance available to the
Administrative Agent, or if an Issuing Bank must disgorge or return any amounts
paid by the Borrower in respect thereof, such Revolving Credit Lender agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank forthwith
on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
of demand by such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account
of such Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent such amount for the account of such Issuing Bank on any
Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a
Letter of Credit Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes
of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Letter of Credit
Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such
Business Day.

                (d)     Failure to Make Letter of Credit Advances. The failure
of any Lender to make the Letter of Credit Advance to be made by it on the date
specified in Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation hereunder to make its Letter of Credit Advance on such date, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Letter of Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.

                SECTION 2.04. Repayment of Advances. (a) Revolving Credit
Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
account of the Revolving Credit Lenders on the Termination Date the aggregate
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances then outstanding.

                (b)     Swing Line Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Bank and each other
Revolving Credit Lender that has made a Swing Line Advance the outstanding
principal amount of each Swing Line Advance made by each of them on the earlier
of the maturity date specified in the applicable Notice of Swing Line Borrowing
(which maturity shall be no later than the seventh day after the requested date
of such Borrowing) and the Termination Date.

                (c)     Letter of Credit Advances. (i) The Borrower shall repay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Issuing Bank and each other
Revolving Credit Lender that has made a Letter of Credit Advance on the earlier
of demand and the Termination Date the outstanding principal amount of each
Letter of Credit Advance made by each of them.

                (ii)    The Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement,
any Letter of Credit Agreement and any other agreement or instrument relating to
any Letter of Credit, and the obligations of Revolving Credit Lenders to
reimburse any Issuing Bank for Letter of Credit Advances not reimbursed by the
Borrower, shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Letter of Credit Agreement and
such other agreement or instrument under all circumstances, including, without
limitation, the following circumstances:

                (A)     any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan
        Document, any Letter of Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any
        other agreement or instrument relating thereto (all of the foregoing
        being, collectively, the "L/C RELATED DOCUMENTS");

                (B)     any change in the time, manner or place of payment of,
        or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower
        in respect of any L/C Related Document or any other amendment or waiver
        of or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C Related
        Documents;

<PAGE>
                                       29

                (C)     the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
        right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or
        any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for which any such
        beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Bank or
        any other Person, whether in connection with the transactions
        contemplated by the L/C Related Documents or any unrelated transaction;

                (D)     any statement or any other document presented under a
        Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
        insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
        inaccurate in any respect;

                (E)     payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
        against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not comply with
        the terms of such Letter of Credit;

                (F)     any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
        Collateral or other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of
        or consent to departure from the Guaranties or any other guarantee, for
        all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower in respect of the L/C
        Related Documents; or

                (G)     any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
        or not similar to any of the foregoing, including, without limitation,
        any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense
        available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or a Guarantor.

                SECTION 2.05. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a)
Optional. The Borrower may, upon at least five Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, terminate in whole or reduce in part the unused portions
of the Letter of Credit Facility and the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments;
provided, however, that each partial reduction of a Facility (i) shall be in an
aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof and (ii) shall be made ratably among the Appropriate Lenders in
accordance with their Commitments with respect to such Facility.

                (b)     Mandatory. (i) The Letter of Credit Facility shall be
permanently reduced from time to time on the date of each reduction in the
Revolving Credit Facility by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the
Letter of Credit Facility exceeds the Revolving Credit Facility after giving
effect to such reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility.

                (ii)    The Swing Line Facility shall be permanently reduced
from time to time on the date of each reduction in the Revolving Credit Facility
by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the Swing Line Facility exceeds
the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to such reduction of the
Revolving Credit Facility.

                (iii)   The Revolving Credit Facility shall be automatically and
permanently reduced, on a pro rata basis, on each date on which prepayment
thereof is required to be made pursuant to Section 2.06(b)(i) in an amount equal
to the applicable Reduction Amount, provided that each such reduction of the
Revolving Credit Facility shall be made ratably among the Revolving Credit
Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitments.

                SECTION 2.06. Prepayments. (a) Optional. The Borrower may, upon
at least one Business Day's notice in the case of Base Rate Advances and three
Business Days' notice in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case to
the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay
the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Advances comprising part of
the same Borrowing in whole

<PAGE>
                                       30

or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such
prepayment on the aggregate principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that
(x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of
$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) if
any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance is made on a date other than the
last day of an Interest Period for such Advance, the Borrower shall also pay any
amounts owing pursuant to Section 8.04(c). Each such prepayment shall be
applied, at the option of the Borrower either (i) to the Revolving Credit
Facility or (ii) to the Swing Line Advances or (iii) to the Letter of Credit
Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prepayment of Swing Line Advances held
by the Swing Line Bank shall not require any prior notice.

                (b)     Mandatory. (i) The Borrower shall, on the date of
receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries from
the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of any assets of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than any sale, lease, transfer or other
disposition of Inventory in the ordinary course of business and not as part of
the sale of a business) or of any Extraordinary Receipt, prepay an aggregate
principal amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowings and
deposit an amount in the L/C Cash Collateral Account in accordance with clause
(viii) below in an amount equal to the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds or such
Extraordinary Receipt, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Borrower
shall not be required to make any such prepayment and deposit with respect to up
to an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 of Net Cash Proceeds in each Fiscal Year
from any such sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of assets or from any
such Extraordinary Receipt. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the
Revolving Credit Facility as set forth in clause (iv) below.

                (ii)    The Borrower shall, on each Business Day, prepay an
aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances comprising part of
the same Borrowings, the Letter of Credit Advances and the Swing Line Advances
and deposit an amount in the L/C Cash Collateral Account in accordance with
clause (viii) below in an amount equal to the amount by which (A) the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of (x) the Revolving Credit Advances, (y) the Letter
of Credit Advances and (z) the Swing Line Advances then outstanding plus the
aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds (B)
the Revolving Credit Facility on such Business Day.

                (iii)   The Borrower shall, on each Business Day, pay to the
Administrative Agent for deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account an amount
sufficient to cause the aggregate amount on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account to equal the amount by which the aggregate Available Amount of all
Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds the Letter of Credit Facility on such
Business Day.

                (iv)    Prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility made
pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be first applied to prepay
Letter of Credit Advances then outstanding until such Advances are paid in full,
second applied to prepay Swing Line Advances then outstanding until such
Advances are paid in full, third applied to prepay Revolving Credit Advances
then outstanding comprising part of the same Borrowings until such Advances are
paid in full and fourth deposited in the L/C Cash Collateral Account to cash
collateralize 100% of the Available Amount of the Letters of Credit then
outstanding; and, in the case of prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility
required pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the amount remaining (if
any) after the prepayment in full of the Advances then outstanding and the 100%
cash collateralization of the aggregate Available Amount of Letters of Credit
then outstanding (the sum of such prepayment amounts, cash collateralization
amounts and remaining amount being referred to herein as the "REDUCTION AMOUNT")
may be retained by the Borrower and the Revolving Credit Facility shall be
permanently reduced as set forth in Section 2.05(b)(iii). Upon the drawing of
any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Banks or Revolving
Credit Lenders, as applicable.

<PAGE>
                                       31

                (v)     All prepayments under this subsection (b) shall be made
together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal
amount prepaid.

                SECTION 2.07. Interest. (a) Scheduled Interest. The Borrower
shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each
Lender from and including the date of such Advance until (but excluding) the
date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per
annum:

                (i)     Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance
        is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum
        of (A) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (B) the Applicable
        Margin in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the
        last day of each March, June, September and December during such periods
        and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in
        full.

                (ii)    Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such
        Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all
        times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (A) the
        Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Advance plus (B) the
        Applicable Margin in effect on the first day of such Interest Period,
        payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such
        Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day
        that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the
        first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurodollar Rate
        Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

                (b)     Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Default, the Borrower shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid
principal amount of each Advance owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on the
dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and on demand, at a rate per
annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be
paid on such Advance pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount
payable under the Loan Documents that is not paid when due, from the date such
amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears
on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum
equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid,
in the case of interest, on the Type of Advance on which such interest has
accrued pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and, in all other cases, on
Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above.

                (c)     Notice of Interest Period and Interest Rate. Promptly
after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(a), a notice of
Conversion pursuant to Section 2.09 or a notice of selection of an Interest
Period pursuant to the terms of the definition of "Interest Period", the
Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Borrower and each Appropriate
Lender of the applicable Interest Period and the applicable interest rate
determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above.

                SECTION 2.08. Fees. (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Revolving Credit Lenders a
commitment fee, from the Effective Date in the case of each Initial Lender (and
from the effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to
which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender) until the Termination
Date, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing September 30, 2004, and on the Termination
Date, at the rate of (i) on the Closing Date, 0.30% per annum and (ii)
thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Percentage, in each case
on the average daily portion of the sum of each Revolving Credit Lender's Unused
Revolving Credit Commitment plus its Pro Rata Share of the Swing Line Reserve
during such period; provided, however, that any commitment fee accrued with
respect to any of the Commitments of a

<PAGE>
                                       32

Defaulting Lender during the period prior to the time such Lender became a
Defaulting Lender and unpaid at such time shall not be payable by the Borrower
so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender except to the extent that
such commitment fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by the Borrower
prior to such time; and provided further that no commitment fee shall accrue on
any of the Commitments of a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender.

                (b)     Letter of Credit Fees, Etc. (i) The Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender a
commission, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing September 30, 2004, and on the Termination
Date, on such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the average daily aggregate Available
Amount during such quarter of Letters of Credit outstanding from time to time at
the rate equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans.

                (ii)    The Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank, for its own
account, (A) an issuance fee for each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank in an amount as the Borrower and such Issuing Bank may agree, payable on
the date of issuance and on renewal of such Letter of Credit, and (B) such other
commissions, fronting fees, transfer fees and other fees and charges in
connection with the issuance or administration of each Letter of Credit issued
by such Issuing Bank as the Borrower and such Issuing Bank shall agree.

                (c)     Agents' Fees. The Borrower shall pay to each Agent and
the Lead Arranger for its own account such fees as may from time to time be
agreed between the Borrower and such Agent or the Lead Arranger, as the case may
be.

                SECTION 2.09. Conversion of Advances. (a) Optional. The Borrower
may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent not later
than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date
of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.07 and
2.10, Convert all or any portion of the Advances of one Type comprising the same
Borrowing into Advances of the other Type; provided, however, that any
Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made
only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances,
any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in
an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in Section 2.02(c), no
Conversion of any Advances shall result in more separate Borrowings than
permitted under Section 2.02(c) and each Conversion of Advances comprising part
of the same Borrowing under any Facility shall be made ratably among the
Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their Commitments under such Facility.
Each such notice of Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above,
specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted and
(iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the
initial Interest Period for such Advances. Each notice of Conversion shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

                (b)     Mandatory. (i) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be
reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such
Advances shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                (ii)    If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any
Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Appropriate
Lenders, whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance.

<PAGE>
                                       33

                (iii)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Default, (x) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of
the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and
(y) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into,
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

                SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs, Etc. (a) If, due to either (i)
the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law),
there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make
or of making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances or of agreeing to
issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of Credit or of
agreeing to make or of making or maintaining Letter of Credit Advances
(excluding, for purposes of this Section 2.10, any such increased costs
resulting from (x) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.12 shall govern)
and (y) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross
income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the
laws of which such Lender Party is organized or has its Applicable Lending
Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the Borrower shall from time
to time, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Lender Party additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party for
such increased cost; provided, however, that a Lender Party claiming additional
amounts under this Section 2.10(a) agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent
with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a
different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a designation would
avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost that may
thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender
Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party. A notice as to the
amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender Party,
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                (b)     If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change
in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with
any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender Party or
any corporation controlling such Lender Party as a result of or based upon the
existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or to issue or participate
in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of such type or the
issuance or maintenance of or participation in the Letters of Credit (or similar
contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender Party or such
corporation (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender
Party, from time to time as specified by such Lender Party, additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender Party in the light of such circumstances,
to the extent that such Lender Party reasonably determines such increase in
capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender Party's commitment to
lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder or to the
issuance or maintenance of or participation in any Letters of Credit. A notice
as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower by such Lender Party shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                (c)     If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances under
any Facility, the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the
Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately
reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their
Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent
shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders, whereupon
(i) each such Eurodollar Rate Advance under such Facility will automatically, on
the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base
Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make, or to
Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the

<PAGE>
                                       34

Borrower that such Lenders have determined that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist.

                (d)     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder,
then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower
through the Administrative Agent, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance under each
Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment will automatically, upon such
demand, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the
Appropriate Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that, before making any such
demand, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different
Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a designation would allow such
Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations
to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Advances and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

                SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower shall
make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of
counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
day when due in U.S. dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Account in same day funds, with payments being received by the
Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter
cause like funds to be distributed (i) if such payment by the Borrower is in
respect of principal, interest, commitment fees or any other Obligation then
payable hereunder and under the Notes to more than one Lender Party, to such
Lender Parties for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices
ratably in accordance with the amounts of such respective Obligations then
payable to such Lender Parties and (ii) if such payment by the Borrower is in
respect of any Obligation then payable hereunder to one Lender Party, to such
Lender Party for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to
be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance
of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained
therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after the
effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall
make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest
assigned thereby to the Lender Party assignee thereunder, and the parties to
such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

                (b)     The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender Party and
each of its Affiliates, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender Party
is not made when due hereunder or, in the case of a Lender, under the Note held
by such Lender, to charge from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender Party or
such Affiliate any amount so due.

                (c)     All computations of interest based on the Prime Rate
shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366
days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the
Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees and Letter of Credit
commissions shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of
360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day
but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest,
fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Administrative

<PAGE>
                                       35

Agent of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                (d)     Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall
be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment
fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause
payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in
the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next
preceding Business Day.

                (e)     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any
Lender Party hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender Party
on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender Party. If
and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to
the Administrative Agent, each such Lender Party shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Base Rate.

                (f)     If the Administrative Agent receives funds for
application to the Obligations under the Loan Documents under circumstances for
which the Loan Documents do not specify the Advances or the Facility to which,
or the manner in which, such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent
may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each
Lender Party ratably in accordance with such Lender Party's proportionate share
of the principal amount of all outstanding Advances and the Available Amount of
all Letters of Credit then outstanding, in repayment or prepayment of such of
the outstanding Advances or other Obligations owed to such Lender Party, and for
application to such principal installments, as the Administrative Agent shall
direct.

                SECTION 2.12. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to
or for the account of any Lender Party or any Agent hereunder or under any Notes
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or
future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender Party
and each Agent, taxes that are imposed on its overall net income by the United
States and taxes that are imposed on its overall net income (and franchise taxes
imposed in lieu thereof) by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of
which such Lender Party or such Agent, as the case may be, is organized or any
political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender Party, taxes that
are imposed on its overall net income (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu
thereof) by the state or foreign jurisdiction of such Lender Party's Applicable
Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in
respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to
as "TAXES"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from
or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender Party
or any Agent, (i) the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after the Borrower and the Administrative Agent have made all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.12) such Lender Party or such Agent, as the case may be,
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make all such deductions and (iii)
the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

                                       36

                (b)     In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or
future stamp, documentary, excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies
that arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Notes or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, performance under, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement, any Notes or any other Loan Documents or the
transfer of any Notes (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

                (c)     The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender Party and each
Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Taxes and Other
Taxes, and for the full amount of taxes of any kind imposed or assessed by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12, imposed on or paid by
such Lender Party or such Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from
the date such Lender Party or such Agent (as the case may be) makes written
demand therefor.

                (d)     Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred
to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
such payment, to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written
proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent. In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes by or on behalf
of the Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States or by or
on behalf of the Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if the
Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, the Borrower
shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Administrative
Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Administrative
Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of
subsections (d) and (e) of this Section 2.12, the terms "UNITED STATES" and
"UNITED STATES PERSON" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

                (e)     Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States shall, on or prior to the date of its
execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender
Party and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender Party, and from time to
time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so
long thereafter as such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), provide
each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal
Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI (or successor forms), as appropriate, or in the
case of a Lender Party that is claiming a reduced rate of United States
withholding tax because of a tax treaty or that has certified in writing to the
Administrative Agent that it is not (i) a "bank" as defined in Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) a 10-percent shareholder (within
the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code) of the
Borrower or (iii) a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower
(within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code), Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or any successor or other form prescribed by the
Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender Party is exempt from or
entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant
to this Agreement or any Notes or, in the case of a Lender Party that has
certified that it is not a "bank" as described above, certifying that such
Lender Party is a foreign corporation, partnership, estate or trust. If the
forms provided by a Lender Party at the time such Lender Party first becomes a
party to this Agreement indicate a United States interest withholding tax rate
in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded
from Taxes unless and until such Lender Party provides the appropriate forms
certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser
rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such
forms; provided, however, that if, at the effective date of the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party becomes a party to this Agreement,
the Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of this
Section 2.12 in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to
interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include
(in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or

<PAGE>
                                       37

other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if
any, applicable with respect to the Lender Party assignee on such date. If any
form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of
information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and
information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN
or W-8ECI or the related certificate described above, that the applicable Lender
Party reasonably considers to be confidential, such Lender Party shall give
notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such
form or document such confidential information.

                (f)     For any period with respect to which a Lender Party has
failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other
document described in subsection (e) above (other than if such failure is due to
a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring
after the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was
required to be provided or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise
is not required under subsection (e) above), such Lender Party shall not be
entitled to indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) of this Section 2.12
with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure;
provided, however, that should a Lender Party become subject to Taxes because of
its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder,
the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender Party shall reasonably request
to assist such Lender Party to recover such Taxes.

                (g)     Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.12 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party. Nothing in this
Section 2.12 or otherwise in this Agreement shall require any Lender Party to
disclose to the Borrower any of its tax returns (or any other information that
it deems to be confidential or proprietary).

                (h)     Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 2.12
shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Notes
and Advances made hereunder.

                SECTION 2.13. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender Party
shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through
the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an
assignment pursuant to Section 8.07) (a) on account of Obligations due and
payable to such Lender Party hereunder and under the Notes at such time in
excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party at such time to (ii) the
aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties
hereunder and under the Notes at such time) of payments on account of the
Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes
at such time obtained by all the Lender Parties at such time or (b) on account
of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender Party hereunder
and under the Notes at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to
the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Lender Party
at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due
and payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time)
of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all
Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time obtained by all of the
Lender Parties at such time, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the
other Lender Parties such interests or participating interests in the
Obligations due and payable or owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender Party to share the excess payment
ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such
purchase from each other Lender Party shall be rescinded and such other Lender
Party

<PAGE>
                                       38

shall repay to the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of
such Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the
purchase price paid to such Lender Party to (ii) the aggregate purchase price
paid to all Lender Parties) of such recovery together with an amount equal to
such Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount
of such other Lender Party's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid
or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so
recovered; provided further that, so long as the Obligations under the Loan
Documents shall not have been accelerated, any excess payment received by any
Appropriate Lender shall be shared on a pro rata basis only with other
Appropriate Lenders. The Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so purchasing an
interest or participating interest from another Lender Party pursuant to this
Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such interest
or participating interest, as the case may be, as fully as if such Lender Party
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such interest or
participating interest, as the case may be.

                SECTION 2.14. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances and
issuances of Letters of Credit shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that
it shall use such proceeds and Letters of Credit), (a) for the Refinancing and
to pay transaction fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith and (b) to
provide working capital for the Loan Parties and for other general corporate
purposes, including, without limitation, for purposes of making Capital
Expenditures.

                SECTION 2.15. Defaulting Lenders. (a) In the event that, at any
one time, (i) any Lender Party shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such
Defaulting Lender shall owe a Defaulted Amount to any Agent or any of the other
Lender Parties and (iii) the Borrower shall make any payment hereunder or under
any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Defaulting Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, on its behalf or on behalf
of such other Agents or such other Lender Parties and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, apply at such time the amount so paid by the
Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender to the payment of each
such Defaulted Amount to the extent required to pay such Defaulted Amount. In
the event that the Administrative Agent shall so apply any such amount to the
payment of any such Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount so applied by the
Administrative Agent shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents payment, to such extent, of such Defaulted Amount on such
date. Any such amount so applied by the Administrative Agent shall be retained
by the Administrative Agent or distributed by the Administrative Agent to such
other Agents or such other Lender Parties, ratably in accordance with the
respective portions of such Defaulted Amounts payable at such time to the
Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other Lender Parties and, if
the amount of such payment made by the Borrower shall at such time be
insufficient to pay all Defaulted Amounts owing at such time to the
Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other Lender Parties, in the
following order of priority:

                (i)     first, to the Agents for any Defaulted Amounts then
        owing to them, in their capacities as such, ratably in accordance with
        such respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to the Agents;

                (ii)    second, to the Issuing Banks and the Swing Line Bank for
        any Defaulted Amounts then owing to them, in their capacities as such,
        ratably in accordance with such respective Defaulted Amounts then owing
        to the Issuing Banks and the Swing Line Bank; and

                (iii)   third, to any other Lender Parties for any Defaulted
        Amounts then owing to such other Lender Parties, ratably in accordance
        with such respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to such other Lender
        Parties.

<PAGE>
                                       39

Any portion of such amount paid by the Borrower for the account of such
Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (a), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (b) of this Section 2.15.

                (b)     In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender Party
shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not owe a
Defaulted Advance or a Defaulted Amount and (iii) the Borrower, any Agent or any
other Lender Party shall be required to pay or distribute any amount hereunder
or under any other Loan Document to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender, then the Borrower or such Agent or such other Lender Party shall pay
such amount to the Administrative Agent to be held by the Administrative Agent,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in escrow or the
Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
hold in escrow such amount otherwise held by it. Any funds held by the
Administrative Agent in escrow under this subsection (b) shall be deposited by
the Administrative Agent in such account as the Administrative Agent shall
designate in writing to the Borrower and the Defaulting Lender, in the name and
under the control of the Administrative Agent, but subject to the provisions of
this subsection (b). The terms applicable to such account, including the rate of
interest payable with respect to the credit balance of such account from time to
time, shall be the Administrative Agent's standard terms applicable to escrow
accounts maintained with it. Any interest credited to such account from time to
time shall be held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under, and applied by
the Administrative Agent from time to time in accordance with the provisions of,
this subsection (b). The Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, apply all funds so held in escrow from time to time
to the extent necessary to make any Advances required to be made by such
Defaulting Lender and to pay any amount payable by such Defaulting Lender
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender Party, as and when such Advances or amounts are required to be made
or paid and, if the amount so held in escrow shall at any time be insufficient
to make and pay all such Advances and amounts required to be made or paid at
such time, in the following order of priority:

                (i)     first, to the Agents for any amounts then due and
        payable by such Defaulting Lender to them hereunder, in their capacities
        as such, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due and
        payable to the Agents;

                (ii)    second, to the Issuing Banks and the Swing Line Bank for
        any amounts then due and payable to them hereunder, in their capacities
        as such, by such Defaulting Lender, ratably in accordance with such
        respective amounts then due and payable to the Issuing Banks and the
        Swing Line Bank;

                (iii)   third, to any other Lender Parties for any amount then
        due and payable by such Defaulting Lender to such other Lender Parties
        hereunder, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due
        and payable to such other Lender Parties; and

                (iv)    fourth, to the Borrower for any Advance then required to
        be made by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to a Commitment of such
        Defaulting Lender.

In the event that any Lender Party that is a Defaulting Lender shall, at any
time, cease to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds held by the Administrative
Agent in escrow at such time with respect to such Lender Party shall be
distributed by the Administrative Agent to such Lender Party and applied by such
Lender Party to the Obligations owing to such Lender Party at such time under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents ratably in accordance with the
respective amounts of such Obligations outstanding at such time.

<PAGE>
                                       40

                (c)     The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender
under this Section 2.15 are in addition to other rights and remedies that the
Borrower may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted
Advance and that any Agent or any Lender Party may have against such Defaulting
Lender with respect to any Defaulted Amount.

                SECTION 2.16. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender Party shall
maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing
the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance
owing to such Lender Party from time to time, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The
Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender Party to the Borrower (with a
copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) to the effect that a promissory
note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for
such Lender Party to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or
otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender Party, the
Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender Party, with a copy to
the Administrative Agent, a Revolving Credit Note substantially the form of
Exhibit A hereto, respectively, payable to the order of such Lender Party in a
principal amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender Party.
All references to Notes in the Loan Documents shall mean Notes, if any, to the
extent issued hereunder.

                (b)     The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 8.07(d) shall include an account for each Lender Party, in
which account shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made
hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate,
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender Party hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender Party's share
thereof.

                (c)     Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent
in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender Party in
its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie
evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become
due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender
Party and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender Party, under
this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of
the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party to make an entry, or any finding
that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall
not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE III
                            CONDITIONS OF LENDING AND
                         ISSUANCES OF LETTERS OF CREDIT

                SECTION 3.01. Conditions Precedent to Initial Extension of
Credit. The obligation of each Lender to make an Advance or of any Issuing Bank
to issue a Letter of Credit on the occasion of the Initial Extension of Credit
hereunder is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent
before or concurrently with the Initial Extension of Credit:

                (a)     The Administrative Agent shall have received on or
        before the day of the Initial Extension of Credit the following, each
        dated such day (unless otherwise specified), in form and substance
        satisfactory to the Lead Arranger and the Administrative Agent (unless
        otherwise specified) and (except for the Notes) in sufficient copies for
        each Lender Party:

                5.01(j), in each case as amended, supplemented or otherwise

                        may deem necessary or desirable in order to perfect and
                        protect the first priority liens and security interests

                        protect the Liens created thereby,

        its Subsidiaries to conduct, all transactions otherwise permitted under
        the Loan Documents with any of their Affiliates on terms that are fair
        and reasonable and no less favorable to the Borrower or such Subsidiary
        than it would obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a
        Person not an Affiliate.

                (j)     Covenant to Guarantee Obligations and Give Security.
        Upon (x) the request of the Collateral Agent following the occurrence

                guaranties, mortgages, pledges, assignments, security agreement
                supplements, intellectual property security agreement
                supplements and security agreements.

                (k)     Further Assurances. (i) Promptly upon request by any
        Agent, or any Lender Party through the Administrative Agent, correct,
        and cause each of its Subsidiaries promptly to correct, any defect or

        require from time to time in order to (A) carry out more effectively the
        purposes of the Loan Documents, (B) to the fullest extent permitted by
        applicable law, subject any Loan Party's or any of its Subsidiaries'
        properties, assets, rights or interests to the Liens now or hereafter

        and requests for information and reports or for action as any Loan Party
        or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to make under such Related
        Document.

                (m)     Preparation of Environmental Reports.(i) At the request
        of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent from time to time,
        provide to the Lender Parties within 60 days after such request, at the
        expense of the Borrower, an environmental site assessment report for any
        of its or its Subsidiaries' properties described in such request,
        prepared by an environmental consulting firm acceptable to the
        Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, indicating the presence or
        absence of Hazardous Materials and the estimated cost of any compliance,
        removal or remedial action in connection with any Hazardous Materials on
        such properties; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if
        the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent determines at any time
        that a material risk exists that any such report will not be provided
        within the time referred to above, the Administrative Agent or the
        Collateral Agent may retain an environmental consulting firm to prepare
        such report at the expense of the Borrower, and the Borrower hereby
        grants and agrees to cause any Subsidiary that owns any property
        described in such request to grant at the time of such request to the
        Agents, the Lender Parties, such firm and any agents or representatives
        thereof an irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject to the rights of
        tenants, to enter onto their respective properties to undertake such an
        assessment.

                (ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause
        (i), as promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, provide to the
        Lead Arranger an environmental assessment report or such other
        information as may be requested by the Lead Arranger, in form and
        substance satisfactory to the Lead Arranger, from an environmental
        consulting firm acceptable to the Lead Arranger and/or from the
        Borrower's environmental counsel, in the case of other information, as
        to any hazards, costs or liabilities under Environmental Laws to which
        any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries may have become subject since
        the date of the Existing Credit Agreement, the amount and nature of such
        hazards, costs or liabilities and the Borrower's plans with respect to
        hazards, costs or liabilities, together with evidence, in form and
        substance satisfactory to the Lead Arranger, that all applicable
        Environmental Laws shall have been complied with. To the extent that
        either such report or any other information that may become available to
        the Lead Arranger shall disclose any hazards, costs or liabilities under
        Environmental Laws or otherwise that the Lead Arranger deems material,
        the Borrower agrees to take such steps as the Lead Arranger may request
        to make adequate provision for such hazards, costs or liabilities.

                (n)     Compliance with Terms of Leaseholds. Make all payments
        and otherwise perform all obligations in respect of all leases of real
        property to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
        keep such leases in full force and effect and not allow such leases to
        lapse or be terminated or any rights to renew such leases to be
        forfeited or cancelled, notify the Administrative Agent of any default
        by any party with respect to such leases and cooperate with the
        Administrative Agent in all respects to cure any such default, and cause
        each of its Subsidiaries to do so, except, in any case, where the
        failure to do so, either individually or in the aggregate, could not be
        reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (o)     Cash Concentration Accounts. Maintain, and cause each of
        its Subsidiaries to maintain, main cash concentration accounts with a
        Lender Party and lockbox accounts into which all proceeds of Collateral
        are paid with a Lender Party or one or more Lenders acceptable to the
        Collateral Agent that have accepted the assignment of such accounts to
        the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant to
        the Security Agreement.

        terms, take all such action to such end as may be from time to time
        requested by the Administrative Agent and, upon request of the
        Administrative Agent, make to each other party to each such Material
        Contract such demands and requests for information and reports or for
        action as any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to make
        under such Material Contract, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to do
        so, except, in any case, where the failure to do so, either individually
        or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably likely to have a Material
        Adverse Effect.

                (q)     Mortgages. By the date that is 60 days after the day of
        the Initial Extension of Credit (which date may be extended, in the

                        recording offices that the Administrative Agent may deem

                        and subsisting Lien on the property described therein in
                        favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the

        covenant or agreement contained in Section 2.14, 5.01(e), (f), (i), (j),
        (m) or (p), 5.02, 5.03 or 5.04; provided, that, the Borrower shall have

        other term, covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document on its
        part to be performed or observed if such failure shall remain unremedied

        Officer becomes aware of such failure or (ii) written notice thereof
        shall have been given to the Borrower by any Agent or any Lender Party;
        or

                (e)     any Loan Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any Excluded

        redeem, purchase or defease such Debt shall be required to be made, in
        each case prior to the stated maturity thereof; or

                (f)     any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall
        generally not pay its debts as such debts become due, or shall admit in
        writing its inability to pay its debts generally, or shall make a
        general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or any proceeding shall
        be instituted by or against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries
        seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking
        liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
        protection, relief, or composition of it or its debts under any law
        relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization

        or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the
        appointment of a receiver, trustee or other similar official for it or
        for any substantial part of its property and, in the case of any such
        proceeding instituted against it (but not instituted by it) that is
        being diligently contested by it in good faith, either such proceeding
        shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period of 30 days or any of
        the actions sought in such proceeding (including, without limitation,
        the entry of an order for relief against, or the appointment of a
        receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for, it or any
        substantial part of its property) shall occur; or any Loan Party or any

        aggregate, for the payment of money in excess of $5,000,000 shall be
        rendered against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries and shall
        remain unpaid and either (i) enforcement proceedings shall have been
        commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or order or (ii) there
        shall be any period of 10 consecutive days during which a stay of
        enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or
        otherwise, shall not be in effect; or

                (h)     any non-monetary judgment or order shall be rendered
        against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries that could be
        reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and there shall be
        any period of 10 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of
        such judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise,
        shall not be in effect; or

                (i)     any provision of any Loan Document after delivery

        reason (other than pursuant to the terms thereof) cease to create a
        valid and perfected first priority lien on and security interest in the
        Collateral purported to be covered thereby; or

                (k)     a Change of Control shall occur; or

                (l)     any ERISA Event shall have occurred with respect to a
        Plan and the sum (determined as of the date of occurrence of such ERISA
        Event) of the Insufficiency of such Plan and the Insufficiency of any
        and all other Plans with respect to which an ERISA Event shall have
        occurred and then exist (or the liability of the Loan Parties and the
        ERISA Affiliates related to such ERISA Event) exceeds $1,000,000; or

                (m)     any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
        notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that it has incurred
        Withdrawal Liability to such Multiemployer Plan in an amount that, when
        aggregated with all other amounts required to be paid to Multiemployer
        Plans by the Loan Parties and the ERISA Affiliates as Withdrawal
        Liability (determined as of the date of such notification), exceeds
        $1,000,000 or requires payments exceeding $500,000 per annum; or

                (n)     any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
        notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer
        Plan is in reorganization or is being terminated, within the meaning of
        Title IV of ERISA, and as a result of such reorganization or termination
        the aggregate annual contributions of the Loan Parties and the ERISA
        Affiliates to all Multiemployer Plans that are then in reorganization or
        being terminated have been or will be increased over the

<PAGE>
                                       70

        amounts contributed to such Multiemployer Plans for the plan years of
        such Multiemployer Plans immediately preceding the plan year in which
        such reorganization or termination occurs by an amount exceeding
        $1,000,000; or

                (o)     an "Event of Default" (as defined in any Mortgage) shall
        have occurred and be continuing;

then, and in any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall at the request,
or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrower,
declare the Commitments of each Lender Party and the obligation of each Lender
Party to make Advances (other than Letter of Credit Advances by an Issuing Bank
or a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and Swing Line Advances
by a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.02(b)) and of the Issuing
Banks to issue Letters of Credit to be terminated, whereupon the same shall
forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of
the Required Lenders, (A) by notice to the Borrower, declare the Notes, all
interest thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Notes, all
such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all
of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, (B) by notice to each
party required under the terms of any agreement in support of which a Standby
Letter of Credit is issued, request that all Obligations under such agreement be
declared to be due and payable and (C) by notice to any Issuing Bank, direct
such Issuing Bank to deliver a Default Termination Notice to the beneficiary of
each Standby Letter of Credit issued by it, and such Issuing Bank shall deliver
such Default Termination Notices; provided, however, that in the event of an
actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under
the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (x) the Commitments of each Lender Party and the
obligation of each Lender Party to make Advances (other than Letter of Credit
Advances by an Issuing Bank or a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section
2.03(c) and Swing Line Advances by a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section
2.02(b)) and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit shall automatically
be terminated and (y) the Notes, all such interest and all such amounts shall
automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
the Borrower.

                SECTION 6.02. Actions in Respect of the Letters of Credit upon
Default. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders,
irrespective of whether it is taking any of the actions described in Section
6.01 or otherwise, make demand upon the Borrower to, and forthwith upon such
demand the Borrower will, pay to the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lender
Parties in same day funds at the Collateral Agent's office designated in such
demand, for deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the
aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding. If at any
time the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent determines that any funds
held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account are subject to any right or claim of any
Person other than the Agents and the Lender Parties or that the total amount of
such funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit,
the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent, pay to the Collateral Agent, as additional funds to be
deposited and held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the
excess of (a) such aggregate Available Amount over (b) the total amount of
funds, if any, then held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account that the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, determines to
be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of
Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, such
funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Banks or Revolving Credit
Lenders, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                THE AGENTS, ETC.

                SECTION 7.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender Party (in
its capacities as a Lender, the Swing Line Bank (if applicable), an Issuing Bank
(if applicable) and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential Hedge
Banks) hereby appoints and authorizes the Lead Arranger and each Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Lead
Arranger and such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such
powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters
not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation,
enforcement or collection of the Notes), no Agent nor the Lead Arranger shall be
required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to
act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lender Parties and all holders of Notes;
provided, however, that no Agent nor the Lead Arranger shall be required to take
any action that exposes such Agent nor the Lead Arranger to personal liability
or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. Each Agent agrees to
give to each Lender Party prompt notice of each notice given to it by the
Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

                SECTION 7.02. Reliance, Etc. Neither the Lead Arranger nor any
Agent nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in
connection with the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence
or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing,
the Lead Arranger and each Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the
holder thereof until, in the case of the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered
into by the Lender that is the payee of such Note, as assignor, and an Eligible
Assignee, as assignee, or, in the case of any other Agent or the Lead Arranger,
such Agent or the Lead Arranger has received notice from the Administrative
Agent that it has received and accepted such Assignment and Acceptance, in each
case as provided in Section 8.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including
counsel for any Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender
Party and shall not be responsible to any Lender Party for any statements,
warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection
with the Loan Documents; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire
as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions
of any Loan Document on the part of any Loan Party or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of any Loan Party; (e) shall not be
responsible to any Lender Party for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or
in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate
or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, telecopy or telex)
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

                SECTION 7.03. Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., GECC and
Affiliates. With respect to its Commitments, the Advances made by it and the
Notes issued to it, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and GECC shall have the
same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender Party and
may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent; and the term "Lender
Party" or "Lender Parties" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and GECC in their respective individual
capacities. Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and GECC and

<PAGE>
                                       72

their respective affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as
trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from and
generally engage in any kind of business with, any Loan Party, any of its
Subsidiaries and any Person that may do business with or own securities of any
Loan Party or any such Subsidiary, all as if Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.
and GECC were not Agents and without any duty to account therefor to the Lender
Parties.

                SECTION 7.04. Lender Party Credit Decision. Each Lender Party
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent, the
Lead Arranger or any other Lender Party and based on the financial statements
referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent, the Lead Arranger or any other Lender Party and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement.

                SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. (a) Each Lender Party severally
agrees to indemnify the Lead Arranger and each Agent (to the extent not promptly
reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against such Lender Party's ratable share
(determined as provided below) of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under the Loan Documents
(collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED COSTS"); provided, however, that no Lender Party
shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from such Agent's or the Lead Arranger's gross negligence or willful
misconduct as found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction with respect to such Agent or the Lead Arranger, as the case may
be. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender Party agrees to reimburse
the Lead Arranger and each Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of
any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of
counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 8.04, to the extent that the Lead
Arranger or such Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by
the Borrower. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving
rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 7.05 applies whether any such
investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender Party or any
other Person.

                (b)     Each Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify each
Issuing Bank (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and
against such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Issuing
Bank in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action
taken or omitted by such Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents; provided,
however, that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Issuing Bank's gross
negligence or willful misconduct as found in a final, non-appealable judgment by
a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender Party agrees to reimburse such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its
ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and
expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 8.04, to the extent
that such Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by
the Borrower.

                (c)     For purposes of this Section 7.05, the Lender Parties'
respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any time,
according to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount

<PAGE>
                                       73

of the Advances outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lender
Parties, (ii) their respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Available Amount
of all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time and (iii) their respective
Unused Revolving Credit Commitments at such time; provided that the aggregate
principal amount of Swing Line Advances owing to the Swing Line Bank and of
Letter of Credit Advances owing to such Issuing Bank shall be considered to be
owed to the Revolving Credit Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective
Revolving Credit Commitments. The failure of any Lender Party to reimburse any
Agent or any Issuing Bank, as the case may be, promptly upon demand for its
ratable share of any amount required to be paid by the Lender Parties to such
Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, as provided herein shall not
relieve any other Lender Party of its obligation hereunder to reimburse such
Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for its ratable share of such
amount, but no Lender Party shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender Party to reimburse such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
for such other Lender Party's ratable share of such amount. Without prejudice to
the survival of any other agreement of any Lender Party hereunder, the agreement
and obligations of each Lender Party contained in this Section 7.05 shall
survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

                SECTION 7.06. Successor Agents. Any Agent may resign at any time
by giving written notice thereof to the Lender Parties and the Borrower and may
be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders. Upon any
such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days
after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required
Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf
of the Lender Parties, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial
bank organized under the laws of the United States or of any State thereof and
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent and, in
the case of a successor Collateral Agent, upon the execution and filing or
recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such
amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other instruments or
notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may
request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported
to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor Agent shall succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties
of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. If within 45 days after written
notice is given of the retiring Agent's resignation or removal under this
Section 7.06 no successor Agent shall have been appointed and shall have
accepted such appointment, then on such 45th day (a) the retiring Agent's
resignation or removal shall become effective, (b) the retiring Agent shall
thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents
and (c) the Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all duties of the retiring
Agent under the Loan Documents until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor Agent as provided above. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent shall have become effective, the
provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

                SECTION 7.07. The Lead Arranger, the Syndication Agent and the
Documentation Agent. It is understood and agreed by all parties hereto that
neither the Lead Arranger, nor the Syndication Agent, nor the Documentation
Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities under this Agreement (except, as
to the Lead Arranger, for certain approval rights expressly provided for
herein), and shall have no liability for any actions taken or not taken in
connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

Collateral Documents, consented to) by the Required Lenders, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that (a) no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all of the Lenders
(other than any Lender Party that is, at such time, a Defaulting Lender), do any

sale, release such Guarantor or otherwise limit such Guarantor's liability with
respect to the Obligations owing to the Agents and the Lender Parties, (iii)
release all or substantially all of the Collateral in any transaction or series
of related transactions or permit the creation, incurrence, assumption or

Commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility if such Lender is directly
affected by such amendment, waiver or consent, (i) increase the Commitments of
such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes held by
such Lender or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder to such Lender, (iii)
postpone any date fixed for any scheduled payment of principal of, or interest
on, the Notes held by such Lender or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder
to such Lender, (iv) change the order of application of any prepayment set forth
in Section 2.06 in any manner that materially affects such Lender; provided
further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed
by the Swing Line Bank or an Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in addition to
the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or obligations
of the Swing Line Bank or of such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under this
Agreement; and provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by an Agent in addition to the Lenders required
above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of such Agent under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

                SECTION 8.02. Notices, Etc. (a) All notices and other

hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to
procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing

Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other
communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to
procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications.

                SECTION 8.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any
Lender Party or any Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right
hereunder or under any Note or any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The
remedies provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law.

                SECTION 8.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay
on demand (i) all costs and expenses of the Lead Arranger and, after the Initial
Extension of Credit, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, also
each Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification and amendment of the Loan Documents (including,
without limitation, (A) all due diligence, collateral review, syndication,
transportation, computer, duplication, appraisal, audit, insurance, consultant,
search, filing and recording fees and expenses and (B) the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel for the Lead Arranger and, after the Initial Extension of
Credit, also each Agent with respect thereto, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of Shearman & Sterling LLP with respect to advising the Lead Arranger
or such Agent as to its rights and responsibilities, or the perfection,
protection or preservation of rights or interests, under the Loan Documents,
with respect to negotiations with any Loan Party or with other creditors of any
Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of any Default or any events
or circumstances that may give rise to a Default and with respect to presenting
claims in or otherwise participating in or monitoring any bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar proceeding involving creditors' rights generally and any
proceeding ancillary thereto, it being understood and agreed that with respect
to the payment of legal fees and expenses, unless and until the circumstances
set forth in clause (ii) below shall occur, the Borrower shall only be
responsible for the fees and expenses of Shearman & Sterling LLP and any local
counsel selected by it in connection with any and all of the foregoing), and
(ii) all costs and expenses of the Lead Arranger, each Agent and each Lender
Party in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents, whether in any
action, suit or litigation, or any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
proceeding affecting creditors' rights generally (including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Lead Arranger, the
Administrative Agent and each Lender Party with respect thereto).

                (b)     The Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and save and
hold harmless the Lead Arranger, each Agent, each Lender Party and each of their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
advisors (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against, and shall pay on
demand, any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that
may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each
case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including, without
limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or
preparation of a defense in connection therewith) (i) the Facilities, the actual
or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances or the

<PAGE>
                                       76

Letters of Credit, the Transaction Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby or (ii) the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous
Materials on any property of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Environmental Action relating in any way to any Loan Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or
expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other
proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 8.04(b) applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or
creditors or an Indemnified Party, whether or not any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the Transaction is consummated. The
Borrower also agrees not to assert any claim against any Agent, any Lender Party
or any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and advisors, on any theory of liability, for special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating
to the Facilities, the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances or
the Letters of Credit, the Transaction Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

                (c)     If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any
Eurodollar Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a
Lender Party other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance,
as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.09(b)(i) or
2.10(d), acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or
for any other reason, or by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender Party other than on
the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance upon an assignment of
rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.07 as a result
of a demand by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.07(a), or if the Borrower
fails to make any payment or prepayment of an Advance for which a notice of
prepayment has been given or that is otherwise required to be made, whether
pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.06 or 6.01 or otherwise, the Borrower shall, upon
demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative
Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party any
amounts required to compensate such Lender Party for any additional losses,
costs or expenses that it may incur as a result of such payment or Conversion or
such failure to pay or prepay, as the case may be, including, without
limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by any Lender Party to fund or maintain such Advance.

                (d)     If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs,
expenses or other amounts payable by it under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel and indemnities, such amount
may be paid on behalf of such Loan Party by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender Party, in its sole discretion.

                (e)     Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the agreements and
obligations of the Borrower contained in Sections 2.10 and 2.12 and this Section
8.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other
amounts payable hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents.

                SECTION 8.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request
or the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.01, each Agent and each Lender Party and each of their
respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and otherwise apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent, such Lender Party
or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against
any and all of the Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under
the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether such Agent or such Lender Party

<PAGE>
                                       77

shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note or Notes and
although such Obligations may be unmatured. Each Agent and each Lender Party
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Agent and each
Lender Party and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition
to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) that such Agent, such Lender Party and their respective Affiliates may
have.

                SECTION 8.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and each Agent and
the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender Party
that such Initial Lender Party has executed it and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each Agent and each Lender Party
and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower shall not
have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of the Lender Parties.

                SECTION 8.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender
may, and (following a demand by such Lender pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.12)
upon at least five Business Days' notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, will assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all
or a portion of its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the
Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment
shall be of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and
obligations under and in respect of one or more Facilities, (ii) except in the
case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment,
was a Lender, an Affiliate of any Lender or an Approved Fund of any Lender or an
assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the
aggregate amount of the Commitments being assigned to such Eligible Assignee
pursuant to such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and
Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than
$1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as shall be approved by the Administrative
Agent and, so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the
time of effectiveness of such assignment, the Borrower), (iii) each such
assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, and (iv) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its
acceptance (other than as to assignments to then existing Lenders and/or their
Affiliates) and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance,
together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and together with a
processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that
the processing and recordation fee set forth in sub-clause (iv) above shall not
be payable (A) with respect to an assignment by any Lender Party to an Affiliate
or an Approved Fund of such Lender Party, or (B) with respect to an assignment
(x) which is both by and to an existing Lender Party or (y) with a stated
effective date occurring prior to the 90th day after the Effective Date hereof.

                (b)     Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording,
from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance,
(i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender or an
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, hereunder and (ii) the Lender or an Issuing
Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.10, 2.12 and 8.04
to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to such
assignment) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in
the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion
of an assigning Lender's or an Issuing Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender or such Issuing Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

<PAGE>
                                       78

                (c)     By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, each Lender Party assignor thereunder and each assignee thereunder
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties thereto and hereto as
follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such
assigning Lender Party makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with any Loan Document or the execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the
perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to
be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (ii) such assigning Lender
Party makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to the financial condition of any Loan Party or the performance or
observance by any Loan Party of any of its obligations under any Loan Document
or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such
assignee will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent, such assigning
Lender Party or any other Lender Party and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such
assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints
and authorizes each Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers and discretion under the Loan Documents as are delegated to
such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers and
discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that
by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender or
an Issuing Bank, as the case may be.

                (d)     The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lender Parties and the Commitment under each Facility of, and
principal amount of the Advances owing under each Facility to, each Lender Party
from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Agents and the Lender Parties may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as a Lender Party hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any
Agent or any Lender Party at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

                (e)     Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender Party and an assignee, together with any Note or
Notes subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such
Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the
information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
thereof to the Borrower and each other Agent. In the case of any assignment by a
Lender, within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the
Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or Notes a new Note to the order of
such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it under
each Facility pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if any assigning
Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder under such Facility, a new Note to
the order of such assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained
by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or
Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and
shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.

                (f)     Each Issuing Bank may assign to an Eligible Assignee all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under the undrawn portion of its
Letter of Credit Commitment at any time;

<PAGE>
                                       79

provided, however, that each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee
and the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an
Assignment and Acceptance.

                (g)     Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or more
Persons (other than any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and
the Note or Notes (if any) held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender
Party's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its
Commitments) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender Party shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lender
Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender Party in
connection with such Lender Party's rights and obligations under this Agreement
and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to
approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any
consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that
such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on,
the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the
extent subject to such participation, postpone any date fixed for any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or release
all or substantially all of the Collateral.

                (h)     Any Lender Party may, in connection with any assignment
or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
Section 8.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender
Party by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided, however, that, prior to any
such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
received by it from such Lender Party.

                (i)     Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender Party may at any time create a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any
Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System.

                SECTION 8.08. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

                SECTION 8.09. No Liability of the Issuing Banks. The Borrower
assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of
any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither
the Agents, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank nor any of their respective
officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for: (a) the use that may
be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or
transferee in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness
of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove
to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c)
payment by such Issuing Bank against presentation of documents that do not
comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents
to bear any reference or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit; (d) any
error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any
draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit
(including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), or any

<PAGE>
                                       80

error in interpretation of technical terms therein; or (e) any other
circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter
of Credit, except that the Borrower shall have a claim against such Issuing
Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of
any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by the Borrower that the
Borrower proves were caused by (i) such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or
gross negligence as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction in determining whether documents presented under any
Letter of Credit comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) such
Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit
after the presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with
the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank
may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.

                SECTION 8.10. Confidentiality. Each Agent and each Lender Party
shall hold all information supplied by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
that is marked confidential (the "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION") confidential in
accordance with its customary practices for handling confidential information,
provided that, in any event, disclosure may be made without the consent of the

hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to
the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of
the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State

hereto by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Borrower at its
address specified pursuant to Section 8.02. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other

any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                (b)     Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do

any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party in any New York State or
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                SECTION 8.13. Governing Law. Each Loan Document (other than the
Letters of Credit, to the extent specified below and except as otherwise

made under and governed by the laws of the State of New York (including for such

related Letter of Credit Agreement, or if no laws or rules are designated, the
International Standby Practices (ISP98 - International Chamber of Commerce
Publication Number 590 (the "ISP Rules")) and, as to matters not governed by the
ISP Rules, the internal laws of the State of New York. The Loan Documents
constitute the entire understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter thereof and supersede any prior agreements, written or oral, with
respect thereto.

                SECTION 8.14. Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender hereby notifies
each Loan Party that, pursuant to the requirements of the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, Pub. L. 107-56 (the "PATRIOT ACT"), it is
required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan

will allow it to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act.

                SECTION 8.15. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Borrower, the
Agents and the Lender Parties irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in
any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to any of the Loan Documents, the
Advances, the Letters of Credit or the actions of any Agent or any Lender Party
in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.

        all appropriate adjustments in payments under the Credit Agreement and
        the Notes for periods prior to the Effective Date directly between
        themselves.
