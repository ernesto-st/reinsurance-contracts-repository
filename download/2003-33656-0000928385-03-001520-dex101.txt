                (iii)   Swing Line Loans.

                        (a)     General Provisions. Swing Line Lender hereby
                                agrees, subject to the limitations set forth
                                below with respect to the maximum amount of
                                Swing Line Loans permitted to be outstanding
                                from time to time, to make a portion of the
                                Revolving Loan Commitments available to Borrower
                                from time to time during the period from the

                                       33

<PAGE>

                                Swing Line Loan Commitment to be used for the
                                purposes identified in subsection 2.5B,
                                notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line
                                Loans, when aggregated with Swing Line Lender's
                                outstanding Revolving Loans and Swing Line
                                Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit
                                Usage then in effect, may exceed Swing Line
                                Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment. The original
                                amount of the Swing Line Loan Commitment is
                                $5,000,000; provided that any reduction of the
                                Revolving Loan Commitments made pursuant to
                                subsection 2.4 that reduces the aggregate
                                Revolving Loan Commitments to an amount less
                                than the then current amount of the Swing Line
                                Loan Commitment shall result in an automatic
                                corresponding reduction of the Swing Line Loan
                                Commitment to the amount of the Revolving Loan
                                Commitments, as so reduced, without any further
                                action on the part of Borrower, Administrative
                                Agent or Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Loan
                                Commitment shall expire on the Revolving Loan
                                Commitment Termination Date and all Swing Line
                                Loans and all other amounts owed hereunder with
                                respect to the Swing Line Loans shall be paid in
                                full no later than that date; provided that the
                                Swing Line Loan Commitment shall expire
                                immediately and without further action on April
                                30, 2003 if the Term Loans are not made on or
                                before that date. Amounts borrowed under this
                                subsection 2.1A(iii) may be repaid and
                                reborrowed to but excluding the Revolving Loan
                                Commitment Termination Date.

                Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Swing Line Loans and the Swing Line Loan Commitment shall
be subject to the limitation that in no event shall the Total Utilization of
Revolving Loan Commitments at any time exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments
then in effect.

                        (b)     Swing Line Loan Prepayment with Proceeds of
                                Revolving Loans. With respect to any Swing Line
                                Loans that have not been voluntarily prepaid by
                                Borrower pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i), Swing
                                Line Lender may, at any time in its sole and
                                absolute discretion, deliver to Administrative
                                Agent (with a copy to Borrower), no later than
                                10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the first
                                Business Day in advance of the proposed Funding
                                Date, a notice requesting Revolving Lenders to

                                amount of such Swing Line Loans (the "Refunded
                                Swing Line Loans") outstanding on the date such
                                notice is given. Borrower hereby authorizes the
                                giving of any such notice and the making of any
                                such Revolving Loans. Anything contained in this
                                Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (1)
                                the proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by
                                Revolving Lenders other than

                                by Administrative Agent to Swing Line Lender
                                (and not to Borrower) and applied to repay a
                                corresponding portion of the Refunded Swing Line
                                Loans and (2) on the day such Revolving Loans
                                are made, Swing Line Lender's Pro Rata Share of
                                the Refunded Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to
                                be paid with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan
                                made by Swing Line Lender, and such portion of
                                the Swing Line Loans deemed to be so paid shall
                                no longer be outstanding as Swing Line Loans and
                                shall no longer be due under the Swing Line
                                Note, if any, of Swing Line Lender but shall
                                instead constitute part of Swing Line Lender's
                                outstanding Revolving Loans and shall be due
                                under the Revolving Note, if any, of Swing Line
                                Lender. Borrower hereby authorizes
                                Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender to
                                charge any accounts Administrative Agent and/or
                                Swing Line Lender may have in Borrower's name
                                (up to the amount available in each such
                                account) in order to immediately pay Swing Line
                                Lender the amount of the Refunded Swing Line
                                Loans to the extent the proceeds of such
                                Revolving Loans made by Revolving Lenders,
                                including the Revolving Loan deemed to be made
                                by Swing Line Lender, are not sufficient to
                                repay in full the Refunded Swing Line Loans. If
                                any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed
                                to be paid) to Swing Line Lender should be
                                recovered by or on behalf of Borrower from Swing
                                Line Lender in any bankruptcy proceeding, in any
                                assignment for the benefit of creditors or
                                otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered
                                shall be ratably shared among all Lenders in the
                                manner contemplated by subsection 10.5.

                        (c)     Swing Line Loan Assignments. If for any reason
                                (1) Revolving Loans are not made upon the
                                request of Swing Line Lender as provided in the

                                sufficient to repay any amounts owed to Swing
                                Line Lender in respect of any outstanding Swing
                                Line Loans or (2) the Revolving Loan Commitments
                                are terminated at a time when any Swing Line
                                Loans are outstanding, each Revolving Lender
                                shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have
                                purchased an assignment in of such outstanding
                                Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to its Pro
                                Rata Share (calculated, in the case of the
                                foregoing clause (2), immediately prior to such
                                termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments)
                                of the unpaid amount of such Swing Line Loans
                                together with accrued interest thereon. Upon one
                                Business Day's notice from Swing Line Lender,
                                each Revolving Lender shall deliver to Swing
                                Line Lender an amount equal to its respective
                                assignment in same day funds at the Funding and
                                Payment Office. In order to further evidence
                                such assignment (and without

                                prejudice to the effectiveness of the assignment
                                provisions set forth above), each Revolving
                                Lender agrees to enter into a separate
                                Assignment Agreement at the request of Swing
                                Line Lender in form and substance reasonably
                                satisfactory to Swing Line Lender. In the event
                                any Revolving Lender fails to make available to
                                Swing Line Lender the amount of such Revolving
                                Lender's assignment as provided in this
                                paragraph, Swing Line Lender shall be entitled
                                to recover such amount on demand from such
                                Revolving Lender together with interest thereon
                                at the rate customarily used by Swing Line
                                Lender for the correction of errors among banks
                                for three Business Days and thereafter at the
                                Base Rate. In the event Swing Line Lender
                                receives a payment of any amount in which other
                                Revolving Lenders have purchased assignments as
                                provided in this paragraph, Swing Line Lender
                                shall promptly distribute to Administrative
                                Agent such payment in its entirety and
                                Administrative Agent shall distribute to each
                                other Revolving Lender (including Swing Line
                                Lender) its Pro Rata Share of such payment.

                        (d)     Revolving Lenders' Obligations. Anything
                                contained herein to the contrary
                                notwithstanding, each Revolving Lender's
                                obligation to make Revolving Loans for the
                                purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing Line
                                Loans pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iii)(b) and
                                each Revolving Lender's obligation to purchase
                                an assignment of any unpaid Swing Line Loans
                                pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph
                                shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
                                not be affected by any circumstance, including
                                (1) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
                                defense or other right which such Revolving
                                Lender may have against Swing Line Lender,
                                Borrower or any other Person for any reason
                                whatsoever; (2) the occurrence or continuation
                                of an Event of Default or a Potential Event of
                                Default; (3) any adverse change in the business,
                                operations, properties, assets, condition
                                (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Company
                                or any of its Subsidiaries; (4) any breach of
                                this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any
                                party thereto; or (5) any other circumstance,
                                happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
                                similar to any of the foregoing; provided that
                                such obligations of each Revolving Lender are
                                subject to the condition that (x) Swing Line
                                Lender believed in good faith that all
                                conditions under Section 4 to the making of the
                                applicable Refunded Swing Line Loans or other
                                unpaid Swing Line Loans, as the case may be,
                                were satisfied at the time such Refunded Swing
                                Line Loans or unpaid Swing Line Loans were made
                                or (y) the satisfaction of any such condition
                                not satisfied had been waived in accordance with
                                subsection 10.6 prior to or at the time such

                                       36

<PAGE>

                                Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing
                                Line Loans were made.

                B.      Borrowing Mechanics. Term Loans or Revolving Loans made
on any Funding Date (other than Revolving Loans made pursuant to a request by
Swing Line Lender pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iii) or Revolving Loans made
pursuant to subsection 3.3B) shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of
$3,000,000 and multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount. Term Loans or
Revolving Loans made on any Funding Date as Eurodollar Rate Loans with a
particular Interest Period shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000
and multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount. Swing Line Loans made on
any Funding Date shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and
multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount. Whenever Borrower desires that
Lenders make Term Loans or Revolving Loans it shall deliver to Administrative
Agent a duly executed Notice of Borrowing no later than 12:00 Noon (New York
City time) at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed Funding Date
(in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan) or at least one Business Day in advance
of the proposed Funding Date (in the case of a Base Rate Loan). Whenever
Borrower desires that Swing Line Lender make a Swing Line Loan, it shall deliver
to Swing Line Lender, with a copy to Administrative Agent a duly executed Notice
of Borrowing no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the proposed
Funding Date. Term Loans and Revolving Loans may be continued as or converted
into Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans in the manner provided in
subsection 2.2D. In lieu of delivering a Notice of Borrowing, Borrower may give
Administrative Agent telephonic notice by the required time of any proposed
borrowing under this subsection 2.1B; provided that such notice shall be
promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a duly executed Notice of Borrowing
to Administrative Agent on or before the applicable Funding Date.

                Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any
liability to Borrower in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above
that Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by an
Officer or other person authorized to borrow on behalf of Borrower or for
otherwise acting in good faith under this subsection 2.1B or under subsection
2.2D, and upon funding of Loans by Lenders, and upon conversion or continuation
of the applicable basis for determining the interest rate with respect to any
Loans pursuant to subsection 2.2D, in each case in accordance with this
Agreement, pursuant to any such telephonic notice Borrower shall have effected
Loans or a conversion or continuation, as the case may be, hereunder.

                Borrower shall notify Administrative Agent prior to the funding
of any Loans in the event that any of the matters to which Borrower is required
to certify in the applicable Notice of Borrowing is no longer true and correct
as of the applicable Funding Date, and the acceptance by Borrower of the
proceeds of any Loans shall constitute a re-certification by Borrower, as of the
applicable Funding Date, as to the matters to which Borrower is required to
certify in the applicable Notice of Borrowing.

                Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and 2.6G,
a Notice of Borrowing for, or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation for conversion
to, or continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu
thereof) shall be irrevocable, and Borrower

                                       37

<PAGE>

shall be bound to make a borrowing or to effect a conversion or continuation in
accordance therewith.

                C.      Disbursement of Funds. All Term Loans and Revolving
Loans shall be made by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to their
respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that neither Administrative
Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in
that other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder nor shall the
Commitment of any Lender to make the particular type of Loan requested be
increased or decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in that
other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder. Promptly after
receipt by Administrative Agent of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to subsection
2.1B (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof), Administrative Agent shall notify
each Lender for that type of Loan of the proposed borrowing. Each such Lender
shall make the amount of its Loan available to Administrative Agent not later
than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the applicable Funding Date, in same day
funds in Dollars, at the Funding and Payment Office. Except as provided in
subsection 2.1A(iii) or subsection 3.3B with respect to Revolving Loans used to
repay Refunded Swing Line Loans or to reimburse any Issuing Lender for the
amount of a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it and with respect to
any Swing Line Loans, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent
specified in subsections 4.1 (in the case of Loans made on the Closing Date) and
4.2 (in the case of all Loans), Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of
such Loans available to Borrower on the applicable Funding Date in same day
funds in Dollars equal to the proceeds of all such Loans received by
Administrative Agent from Lenders. In the case of Swing Line Loans, upon
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent specified in subsection 4.2,
Swing Line Lender shall make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to
Borrower not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the applicable Funding
Date, in same day funds in Dollars and pursuant to the instructions in the
Notice of Borrowing for such Swing Line Loan.

                Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any
Lender prior to a Funding Date for any Loans that such Lender does not intend to
make available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's Loan
requested on such Funding Date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender
has made such amount available to Administrative Agent on such Funding Date and
Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to Borrower a corresponding amount on such Funding Date. If such
corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by
such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon,
for each day from such Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to
Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the
correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the
Base Rate. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon
Administrative Agent's demand therefor, Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify Borrower and Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to
Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from such
Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the
rate payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans. Nothing in this
subsection 2.1C shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
fulfill its Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrower

                                       38

<PAGE>

may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

                D.      The Register. Administrative Agent, acting for these
purposes solely as an agent of Borrower (it being acknowledged that
Administrative Agent, in such capacity, and its officers, directors, employees,
agent and affiliates shall constitute Indemnitees under subsection 10.3), shall
maintain (and make available for inspection by Borrower and Lenders upon
reasonable prior notice at reasonable times) at its address referred to in
subsection 10.8 a register for the recordation of, and shall record, the names
and addresses of Lenders and the Term Loan Commitment, Revolving Loan
Commitment, Swing Line Loan Commitment, Term Loan, Revolving Loans and Swing
Line Loans of each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). Borrower,
Administrative Agent and Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed as
Lenders in the Register as the holders and owners of the corresponding
Commitments and Loans listed therein for all purposes hereof; all amounts owed
with respect to any Commitment or Loan shall be owed to the Lender listed in the
Register as the owner thereof; and any request, authority or consent of any
Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding
on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the corresponding
Commitments or Loans. Each Lender shall record on its internal records (and make
available for inspection by Administrative Agent upon reasonable prior notice)
the amount of its Loans and Commitments and each payment in respect hereof, and
any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower, absent
manifest error, subject to the entries in the Register, which shall, absent
manifest error, govern in the event of any inconsistency with any Lender's
records. Failure to make any recordation in the Register or in any Lender's
records, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any Loans or
Commitments or any Obligations in respect of any Loans.

                E.      Optional Notes. If so requested by any Lender by written
notice to Borrower at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date or at
any time thereafter, Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and/or,
if applicable and if so specified in such notice, to any Person who is an
assignee of such Lender pursuant to subsection 10.1) on the Closing Date (or, if
such notice is delivered after the Closing Date, promptly after Borrower's
receipt of such notice) a promissory note or promissory notes to evidence such
Lender's Term Loan, Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans, substantially in the
form of Exhibit IV, Exhibit V, or Exhibit VI annexed hereto, respectively, with
appropriate insertions.

        2.2     INTEREST ON THE LOANS.

                A.      Rate of Interest. Subject to the provisions of
subsections 2.6 and 2.7, each Term Loan and each Revolving Loan shall bear
interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date made through
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate determined by
reference to the Base Rate or the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate. Subject to the
provisions of subsection 2.7, each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the
unpaid principal amount thereof from the date made through maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) at a rate determined by reference to the Base Rate.
The applicable basis for determining the rate of interest with respect to any
Term Loan or any Revolving Loan shall be selected by Borrower initially at the
time a Notice of Borrowing is given with respect to such Loan pursuant to
subsection 2.1B (subject to the last sentence of subsection 2.1B), and the basis
for determining

                                       39

<PAGE>

the interest rate with respect to any Term Loan or any Revolving Loan may be
changed from time to time pursuant to subsection 2.2D (subject to the last
sentence of subsection 2.1B). If on any day a Term Loan or Revolving Loan is
outstanding with respect to which notice has not been delivered to
Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement specifying
the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day
that Loan shall bear interest determined by reference to the Base Rate.

                (i)     Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.2E, 2.2G and
        2.7, the Term Loans shall bear interest through maturity as follows:

                        (a)     if a Base Rate Loan, then at the sum of the Base
                Rate plus 3.5% per annum; or

                        (b)     if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then at the sum of
                the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 4.5% per annum.

                (ii)    Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.2E, 2.2G and
        2.7, the Revolving Loans shall bear interest through maturity as
        follows:

                        (a)     if a Base Rate Loan, then at the sum of the Base
                Rate plus the applicable Base Rate Margin set forth in the table
                below opposite the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the
                four-Fiscal Quarter period for which the applicable Pricing
                Certificate has been delivered pursuant to subsection 6.1(iv);
                or

                        (b)     if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then at the sum of
                the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable Eurodollar Rate
                Margin set forth in the table below opposite the Consolidated
                Leverage Ratio for the four-Fiscal Quarter period for which the
                applicable Pricing Certificate has been delivered pursuant to
                subsection 6.1(iv):

provided that, until the delivery of the Pricing Certificate for the Fiscal
Quarter ending September 30, 2003, the applicable margin for the Revolving Loans
that are Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be 4.00% per annum and for Revolving Loans
that are Base Rate Loans shall be 3.00% per annum.

        (iii)   Upon delivery of the Pricing Certificate by Borrower to
        Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 6.1(iv), the Base Rate
        Margin for Revolving Loan Commitments and the Eurodollar Rate Margin for
        Revolving Loan Commitments shall automatically be adjusted in accordance
        with such Pricing Certificate, such adjustment to become effective on
        the next succeeding Business Day following the receipt by Administrative
        Agent of such Pricing Certificate (subject to the provisions of the
        foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)); provided that, if at any time a Pricing
        Certificate is not delivered at the time required pursuant to subsection
        6.1(iv), from the time such Pricing Certificate was required to be
        delivered until delivery of such Pricing Certificate, the applicable
        margins shall be the maximum percentage amount for the relevant Loan set
        forth above.

        (iv)    Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.2E, 2.2G and 2.7, the
        Swing Line Loans shall bear interest through maturity at the sum of the
        Base Rate plus the applicable Base Rate Margin for Revolving Loans minus
        the Commitment Fee Percentage.

                B.      Interest Periods. In connection with each Eurodollar
Rate Loan, Borrower may, pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion/Continuation, as the case may be, select an interest period
(each an "Interest Period") to be applicable to such Loan, which Interest Period
shall be, at Borrower's option, either a one, two, three or six month period;
provided that:

                (i)     the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan
        shall commence on the Funding Date in respect of such Loan, in the case
        of a Loan initially made as a Eurodollar Rate Loan, or on the date
        specified in the applicable Notice of Conversion/Continuation, in the
        case of a Loan converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan;

                (ii)    in the case of immediately successive Interest Periods
        applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan continued as such pursuant to a
        Notice of Conversion/Continuation, each successive Interest Period shall
        commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;

<PAGE>

                (iii)   if an Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day
        that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the
        next succeeding Business Day; provided that, if any Interest Period
        would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day
        of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month,
        such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

                (iv)    any Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day
        of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically
        corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest
        Period) shall, subject to clause (v) of this subsection 2.2B, end on the
        last Business Day of a calendar month;

                (v)     no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the
        Term Loans shall extend beyond April 30, 2009 and no Interest Period
        with respect to any portion of the Revolving Loans shall extend beyond
        the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date;

                (vi)    no Interest Period with respect to any type of Term
        Loans shall extend beyond a date on which Borrower is required to make a
        scheduled payment of principal of such type of Term Loans, unless the
        sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of such type of Term Loans
        that are Base Rate Loans plus (b) the aggregate principal amount of such
        type of Term Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans with Interest Periods
        expiring on or before such date equals or exceeds the principal amount
        required to be paid on such type of Term Loans on such date;

                (vii)   there shall be no more than 5 Interest Periods
        outstanding at any time; and

                (viii)  in the event Borrower fails to specify an Interest
        Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan in the applicable Notice of
        Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Borrower shall be deemed
        to have selected an Interest Period of one month.

                C.      Interest Payments. Subject to the provisions of
subsection 2.2E, interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on and to
each Interest Payment Date applicable to that Loan, upon any prepayment of that
Loan (to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid) and at maturity
(including final maturity).

                D.      Conversion or Continuation. Subject to the provisions of
subsection 2.6, Borrower shall have the option (i) to convert at any time all or
any part of its outstanding Term Loans or Revolving Loans equal to $3,000,000
and multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount from Loans bearing interest
at a rate determined by reference to one basis to Loans bearing interest at a
rate determined by reference to an alternative basis or (ii) upon the expiration
of any Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or
any portion of such Loan equal to $5,000,000 and multiples of $1,000,000 in
excess of that amount as a Eurodollar Rate Loan; provided, however, that a
Eurodollar Rate Loan may only be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the
expiration date of an Interest Period applicable thereto.

                Borrower shall deliver a duly executed Notice of
Conversion/Continuation to

                                       42

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least one
Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion date (in the case of a
conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least three Business Days in advance of
the proposed conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a
continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan). In lieu of delivering a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, Borrower may give Administrative Agent telephonic
notice by the required time of any proposed conversion/continuation under this
subsection 2.2D; provided that such notice shall be promptly confirmed in
writing by delivery of a duly executed Notice of Conversion/Continuation to
Administrative Agent on or before the proposed conversion/continuation date.
Upon receipt of written or telephonic notice of any proposed
conversion/continuation under this subsection 2.2D, Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of the Loan subject to the Notice of
Conversion/Continuation.

                E.      Default Rate. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of any Event of Default, the outstanding principal amount of all
Loans and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments
thereon not paid when due and any fees and other amounts then due and payable
hereunder, shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in
any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws)
payable upon demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest
rate otherwise payable under this Agreement with respect to the applicable Loans
(or, in the case of any such fees and other amounts, at a rate which is 2% per
annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under this Agreement for
Base Rate Loans); provided that, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, upon the
expiration of the Interest Period in effect at the time any such increase in
interest rate is effective such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall thereupon become
Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear interest payable upon demand at a rate
which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under
this Agreement for Base Rate Loans. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates
of interest provided for in this subsection 2.2E is not a permitted alternative
to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or
otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or
any Lender.

                F.      Computation of Interest. Interest on the Loans shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of
days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on any
Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period
applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted
from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan
to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of
payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to
such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a Eurodollar
Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such Eurodollar Rate
Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded; provided that if a Loan is repaid
on the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on that
Loan.

                G.      Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this subsection 2.2, in no event shall the rate of interest payable by
Borrower with respect to any Loan exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted
to be charged under applicable law.

                                       43

        2.3     FEES.

                A.      Commitment Fees. Borrower agrees to pay to
Administrative Agent, for distribution to each Revolving Lender in proportion to
that Lender's Pro Rata Share, commitment fees for the period from and including
the Closing Date to and excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date
equal to the average of the daily excess of the Revolving Loan Commitments over
the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans
(but not any outstanding Swing Line Loans) plus (ii) the Letter of Credit Usage
multiplied by 0.50% per annum, such commitment fees to be calculated on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of March, June, September and
December of each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the
Closing Date, and on the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date.

                B.      Other Fees. Borrower agrees to pay to Administrative
Agent such fees in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between
Borrower and Administrative Agent.

        telephonic notice to Administrative Agent on or prior to 12:00 Noon (New

        prepayment, which notice, if telephonic, shall be promptly confirmed in
        writing, at any time and from time to time prepay any Swing Line Loan on
        any Business Day in whole or in part in an aggregate minimum amount of
        $500,000 and multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount. Borrower
        may, upon not less than one Business Day's prior written or telephonic
        notice, in the case of Base Rate Loans, and three Business Days' prior
        written or telephonic notice, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, in

        confirmed in writing to Administrative Agent who shall promptly notify
        each Lender for the Loans to be prepaid), at any time and from time to
        time prepay any Term Loans or Revolving Loans on any Business Day in

        Eurodollar Rate Loan may only be prepaid on the expiration of the
        Interest Period applicable thereto. Notice of prepayment having been
        given as aforesaid shall be irrevocable and the principal amount of the
        Loans specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the
        prepayment date specified therein. Any such voluntary prepayment shall
        be applied as specified in subsection 2.4B(iv).

        Borrower may, upon not less than three Business Days' prior written or
        telephonic notice confirmed in writing to Administrative Agent who shall

        from time to time terminate in whole or permanently reduce in part,
        without premium or penalty, the Revolving Loan Commitments in an amount
        up to the amount by which the Revolving Loan Commitments exceed the

        proposed termination or reduction; provided that any such partial
        reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be in an aggregate
        minimum amount of $5,000,000 and multiples of $5,000,000 in excess of
        that amount. Borrower's notice to Administrative Agent shall designate
        the date (which shall be a Business Day) of such termination or
        reduction and the amount of any partial reduction, and such termination
        or reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be effective on the
        date specified in Borrower's notice and shall reduce the Revolving Loan
        Commitment of each Revolving Lender proportionately to its Pro Rata
        Share. Any such voluntary reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments
        shall be applied as specified in subsection 2.4B(iv).

                (iii)   Mandatory Prepayments and Mandatory Reductions of
        Revolving Loan Commitments. The Loans shall be prepaid and/or the
        Revolving Loan Commitments shall be permanently reduced in the amounts
        and under the circumstances set forth below, all such prepayments and/or
        reductions to be applied as set forth below or as more specifically
        provided in subsection 2.4B(iv):

                        (a)     Prepayments and Reductions From Net Asset Sale
                Proceeds. No later than the date of receipt by Company or any of
                its Subsidiaries of any Net Asset Sale Proceeds in respect of
                any Asset Sale, Borrower shall either (1) prepay the Loans
                and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be permanently
                reduced

                                       46

<PAGE>

                in an aggregate amount equal to such Net Asset Sale Proceeds or
                (2) so long as no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default
                shall have occurred and be continuing and to the extent that
                aggregate Net Asset Sale Proceeds from the Closing Date through
                the date of determination do not exceed $2,500,000, deliver to
                Administrative Agent an Officer's Certificate setting forth (x)
                that portion of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds that Borrower or
                such Subsidiary intends to reinvest in equipment or other
                productive assets of the general type used in the business of
                Company and its Subsidiaries within 180 days of such date of
                receipt and (y) the proposed use of such portion of the Net
                Asset Sale Proceeds and such other information with respect to
                such reinvestment as Administrative Agent may reasonably
                request, and Company shall, or shall cause one or more of its
                Subsidiaries to, promptly and diligently apply such portion to
                such reinvestment purposes; provided, however, that, pending
                such reinvestment, such portion of the Net Asset Sale Proceeds
                shall be applied to prepay outstanding Revolving Loans (without
                a reduction in Revolving Loan Commitments) to the full extent
                thereof. In addition, Borrower shall, no later than 180 days
                after receipt of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds that have not
                theretofore been applied to the Obligations or that have not
                been so reinvested as provided above, make an additional
                prepayment of the Loans (and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments
                shall be permanently reduced) in the full amount of all such Net
                Asset Sale Proceeds.

                        (b)     Prepayments and Reductions from Net
                Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds. No later than the first
                Business Day following the date of receipt by Administrative
                Agent or by Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Net
                Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds that are required to be applied
                to prepay the Loans and/or reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments
                pursuant to the provisions of subsection 6.4C, Borrower shall
                prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
                permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to the amount
                of such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds.

                        (c)     Prepayments and Reductions Due to Issuance of
                Equity Securities. On the date of receipt of the Net Securities
                Proceeds from the issuance of any Capital Stock of Company or
                any of its Subsidiaries (other than Net Securities Proceeds in
                an aggregate amount not to exceed $5,000,000 in any Fiscal Year)
                or from any capital contribution to Company by any holder of

                prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
                permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to such Net
                Securities Proceeds.

                        (d)     Prepayments and Reductions Due to Issuance of
                Indebtedness. On the date of receipt of the Net Securities
                Proceeds from the issuance of any Indebtedness of Company or any
                of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, other than
                Indebtedness permitted pursuant to subsection 7.1 (except for
                Indebtedness permitted by subsection 7.1(vii)(y)), Borrower
                shall prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments
                shall be permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to
                such Net Securities Proceeds.

                Excess Cash Flow. (1) In the event that there shall be
                Consolidated Excess Cash Flow for any Fiscal Year (commencing
                with Fiscal Year 2003), Borrower shall, no later than 90 days
                after the end of such Fiscal Year, prepay the Loans and/or the
                Revolving Loan Commitments shall be permanently reduced in an
                aggregate amount equal to 75% of such Consolidated Excess Cash
                Flow; provided, that so long as no Event of Default or Potential
                Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall
                prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
                permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to 50% of such
                Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, if the Consolidated Leverage
                Ratio at the last day of such Fiscal Year is 2.00:1:00 or less.
                (2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Event of
                Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred and be
                continuing either on the last day of such Fiscal Year or on the
                date such payment would be made and Consolidated Excess Cash
                Flow for such Fiscal Year (commencing with Fiscal Year 2003)
                equals or exceeds $30,000,000, Borrower may retain up to
                $5,000,000 of such Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (such retained
                amount, the "Retained Excess Cash Flow") to make acquisitions
                permitted under subsection 7.3(vi) and to enter into marketing,
                joint venture or manufacturing arrangements; provided, that, any
                such Retained Excess Cash Flow not used as permitted above by
                Borrower by the end of the Fiscal Year immediately following the
                date of determination, must be applied in accordance with
                subsection 2.4B(iii)(e)(1).

                        (f)     Prepayments and Reductions from Payment of the
                Pledged Belgium Indebtedness. No later than the first Business
                Day following the date of receipt by Borrower of any payment
                under the Pledged Belgium Indebtedness, Borrower shall prepay
                the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
                permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to the amount
                of such payment.

                        (g)     Calculations of Net Proceeds Amounts; Additional
                Prepayments and Reductions Based on Subsequent Calculations.
                Concurrently with any prepayment of the Loans and/or reduction
                of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to subsections
                2.4B(iii)(a)-(f), Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent
                an Officer's Certificate demonstrating the calculation of the
                amount of the applicable Net Asset Sale Proceeds, Net
                Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, Net Securities Proceeds,
                Consolidated Excess Cash Flow or pursuant to payments made under
                the Pledged Belgium Indebtedness, as the case may be, that gave
                rise to such prepayment and/or reduction. In the event that
                Borrower shall subsequently determine that the actual amount was
                greater than the amount set forth in such Officer's Certificate,
                Borrower shall promptly make an additional prepayment of the
                Loans (and/or, if applicable, the Revolving Loan Commitments
                shall be permanently reduced) in an amount equal to the amount
                of such excess, and Borrower shall concurrently therewith
                deliver to Administrative Agent an

                                       48

<PAGE>

                Officer's Certificate demonstrating the derivation of the
                additional amount resulting in such excess.

                        (h)     Prepayments Due to Reductions or Restrictions of
                Revolving Loan Commitments. Borrower shall from time to time
                prepay first the Swing Line Loans and second the Revolving Loans
                to the extent necessary (1) so that the Total Utilization of
                Revolving Loan Commitments shall not at any time exceed the
                Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect.

                (iv)    Application of Prepayments and Reductions of Revolving
        Loan Commitments.

                        (a)     Application of Voluntary Prepayments by Type of
                Loans and Order of Maturity. Any voluntary prepayments pursuant
                to subsection 2.4B(i) shall be applied as specified by Borrower
                in the applicable notice of prepayment; provided that in the
                event Borrower fails to specify the Loans to which any such
                prepayment shall be applied, such prepayment shall be applied
                first to repay outstanding Swing Line Loans to the full extent
                thereof, second to repay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full
                extent thereof, and third to repay outstanding Term Loans to the
                full extent thereof. Any voluntary prepayments of the Term Loans
                pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall be applied to reduce the
                scheduled installments of principal of the Term Loans set forth
                in subsections 2.4A(i) on a pro rata basis (in accordance with
                the respective outstanding principal amounts thereof) to each
                remaining scheduled installment of principal of the Term Loans,
                as set forth in subsection 2.4A(i).

                        (b)     Application of Mandatory Prepayments by Type of
                Loans. Except as provided in subsection 2.4D, any amount
                required to be applied as a mandatory prepayment of the Loans
                and/or a reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to
                subsections 2.4B(iii)(a)-(f) shall be applied first to prepay
                the Term Loans to the full extent thereof, second, to the extent
                of any remaining portion of such amount, to prepay the Swing
                Line Loans to the full extent thereof and to permanently reduce
                the Revolving Loan Commitments by the amount of such prepayment,
                third, to the extent of any remaining portion of such amount, to
                repay the Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof and to
                further permanently reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments by the
                amount of such prepayment and fourth, to the extent of any
                remaining portion of such amount, to further permanently reduce
                the Revolving Loan Commitments to the full extent thereof. Any
                mandatory reduction of Revolving Commitments pursuant to this
                subsection 2.4B shall be in proportion to each Revolving
                Lender's Pro Rata Share.

                        (c)     Application of Mandatory Prepayments of Term
                Loans to Scheduled Installments of Principal Thereof/Waiver of
                Term Loan Payments. Any mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans
                pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii), subject to the last sentence
                of subsection 2.4B(iv)(c), shall be applied on a pro rata basis
                (in accordance with the respective outstanding principal amounts
                thereof) to

                                       49

<PAGE>

                each scheduled installment of principal of the Term Loans set
                forth in subsection 2.4A(i) that is unpaid at the time of such
                prepayment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any
                mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to subsection
                2.4B(iii), the Lenders of the Term Loans may waive the right to
                receive the amount of such mandatory prepayment of the Term
                Loans. If any Lender or Lenders waive the right to receive the
                amount of such mandatory prepayment, all of the amount that
                otherwise would have been applied to mandatorily prepay the Term
                Loans of such Lender or Lenders shall be retained by Borrower.

                        (d)     Application of Prepayments to Base Rate Loans
                and Eurodollar Rate Loans. Considering Term Loans and Revolving
                Loans being prepaid separately, any prepayment thereof (a) in
                respect of Revolving Loans, shall be applied first to Base Rate
                Loans to the full extent thereof before application to
                Eurodollar Rate Loans and (b) in respect of Term Loans, shall be
                applied on a pro rata basis among all outstanding Loans, in each
                case in a manner that minimizes the amount of any payments
                required to be made by Borrower pursuant to subsection 2.6D.

                C.      General Provisions Regarding Payments.

                (i)     Manner and Time of Payment. All payments by Borrower of
        principal, interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made in Dollars
        in same day funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any
        restriction or condition, and delivered to Administrative Agent not
        later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date due at the
        Funding and Payment Office for the account of Lenders; funds received by
        Administrative Agent after that time on such due date shall be deemed to
        have been paid by Company on the next succeeding Business Day. Borrower
        hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to charge any accounts
        Administrative Agent may have in Borrower's name in order to cause
        timely payment to be made to Administrative Agent of all principal,
        interest, fees and expenses due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds
        being available in its accounts for that purpose).

                (ii)    Application of Payments to Principal and Interest. All
        payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan shall include
        payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or
        prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in
        respect of any Loan on the Interest Payment Date with respect to such
        Loan) shall be applied to the payment of interest before application to
        principal.

                (iii)   Apportionment of Payments. Aggregate principal and
        interest payments (a) in respect of Revolving Loans, shall be
        apportioned among all outstanding Loans to which such payments relate,
        proportionately to Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares and (b) in
        respect of Term Loans, shall be apportioned among all outstanding Loans
        to which such payments relate, proportionately to Lenders' respective
        Pro Rata Shares after giving effect to any waiver of any Lender pursuant
        to subsection 2.1B(iv)(c). Administrative Agent shall promptly
        distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share of all such payments

                                       50

<PAGE>

        received by Administrative Agent and the commitment fees of such Lender,
        if any, when received by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection
        2.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection
        2.4C(iii), if, pursuant to the provisions of subsection 2.6C, any Notice
        of Conversion/Continuation is withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or if
        any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share
        of any Eurodollar Rate Loans, Administrative Agent shall give effect
        thereto in apportioning payments received thereafter.

                (iv)    Payments on Business Days. Whenever any payment to be
        made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business
        Day, such payment shall be made on the preceding Business Day.

                (v)     Notation of Payment. Each Lender agrees that before
        disposing of any Note held by it, or any part thereof (other than by
        granting participations therein), that Lender will make a notation
        thereon of all Loans evidenced by that Note and all principal payments
        previously made thereon and of the date to which interest thereon has
        been paid; provided that the failure to make (or any error in the making
        of) a notation of any Loan made under such Note shall not limit or
        otherwise affect the obligations of Company hereunder or under such Note
        with respect to any Loan or any payments of principal or interest on
        such Note.

                D.      Application of Proceeds of Collateral and Payments after
Event of Default.

                Upon termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments or upon the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, if requested by
Requisite Lenders (a) all payments received on account of the Obligations,
whether from Borrower, from any Guarantor or otherwise, shall be applied by
Administrative Agent against the Obligations and (b) all proceeds received by
Administrative Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon all or any part of the Collateral under any Collateral Document
shall be held by Administrative Agent as Collateral for, and/or (then or at any
time thereafter) applied in full or in part by Administrative Agent against, the
applicable Secured Obligations (as defined in such Collateral Document), in each
case in the following order of priority:

                (i)     to the payment of all costs and expenses of such sale,
        collection or other realization, all other expenses, liabilities and
        advances made or incurred by Administrative Agent in connection
        therewith, and all amounts for which Administrative Agent is entitled to
        compensation (including the fees described in subsection 2.3),
        reimbursement and indemnification under any Loan Document and all
        advances made by Administrative Agent thereunder for the account of the
        applicable Loan Party, and to the payment of all costs and expenses paid
        or incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with the Loan
        Documents, all in accordance with subsections 9.4, 10.2 and 10.3 and the
        other terms of this Agreement and the Loan Documents;

                (ii)    thereafter, to the payment of all other Obligations for
        the ratable benefit of the holders thereof (subject to the provisions of
        subsection 2.4C(ii) hereof); and

                                       51

<PAGE>

                (iii)   thereafter, to the payment to or upon the order of such
        Loan Party or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same
        or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

        2.5     USE OF PROCEEDS.

                A.      Term Loans. The proceeds of the Term Loans shall be
applied by Borrower (i) to refinance a portion of the existing Indebtedness
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement and (ii) to pay Transaction
Costs.

                B.      Revolving Loans; Swing Line Loans. The proceeds of any
Revolving Loans and any Swing Line Loans shall be applied by Borrower for
working capital and other general corporate purposes of Company and its
Subsidiaries, which may include the making of intercompany loans to any of
Borrower's wholly-owned Subsidiaries, in accordance with subsection 7.1(iv), for
their own general corporate purposes.

                C.      Margin Regulations. No portion of the proceeds of any
borrowing under this Agreement shall be used by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any manner that might cause the borrowing or the application of
such proceeds to violate Regulation U, Regulation T or Regulation X of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board
or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect on the date or dates
of such borrowing and such use of proceeds.

        2.6     SPECIAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.

                Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the following provisions shall govern with respect to Eurodollar Rate
Loans as to the matters covered:

                A.      Determination of Applicable Interest Rate. As soon as
practicable after 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate
Determination Date, Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination
shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon all parties) the
interest rate that shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an
interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and
shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in
writing) to Company and each Lender.

                B.      Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate. In the
event that Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall
be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), on any Interest Rate
Determination Date that by reason of circumstances affecting the London
interbank market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
interest rate applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the
definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, Administrative Agent shall on such date
give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower
and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or
converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as Administrative Agent
notifies Borrower and Lenders that the circumstances

                                       52

<PAGE>

giving rise to such notice no longer exist and (ii) any Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by Borrower with respect to the Loans in
respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be for a Base
Rate Loan.

                C.      Illegality or Impracticability of Eurodollar Rate Loans.
In the event that on any date any Lender shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but shall
be made only after consultation with Borrower and Administrative Agent) that the
making, maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has become
unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law,
treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict
with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not
having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be
unlawful) or (ii) has become impracticable, or would cause such Lender material
hardship, as a result of contingencies occurring after the date of this
Agreement which materially and adversely affect the London interbank market or
the position of such Lender in that market, then, and in any such event, such
Lender shall be an "Affected Lender" and it shall on that day give notice (by
telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and
Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice Administrative Agent
shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Thereafter (a) the obligation of
the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall be withdrawn by the Affected
Lender, (b) to the extent such determination by the Affected Lender relates to a
Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Borrower pursuant to a Notice of
Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Affected Lender shall make
such Loan as (or convert such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan, (c)
the Affected Lender's obligation to maintain its outstanding Eurodollar Rate
Loans (the "Affected Loans") shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the
expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected
Loans or when required by law, and (d) the Affected Loans shall automatically
convert into Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described
above relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Borrower
pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation,
Borrower shall have the option, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, to
rescind such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation as to all
Lenders by giving notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing)
to Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which the Affected
Lender gives notice of its determination as described above (which notice of
rescission Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender).
Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this
subsection 2.6C shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an Affected
Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                D.      Compensation For Breakage or Non-Commencement of
Interest Periods. Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by
that Lender pursuant to subsection 2.8, for all reasonable losses, expenses and
liabilities (including any interest paid by that Lender to lenders of funds
borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurodollar Rate Loans and any loss, expense
or liability sustained by that Lender in connection with the liquidation or

                                       53

<PAGE>

re-employment of such funds) which that Lender may sustain: (i) if for any
reason (other than a default by that Lender) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate
Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a
telephonic request therefor, or a conversion to or continuation of any
Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation or a telephonic request therefor, (ii) if any prepayment
or other principal payment or any conversion of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans
(including any prepayment or conversion occasioned by the circumstances
described in subsection 2.6C) occurs on a date prior to the last day of an
Interest Period applicable to that Loan, (iii) if any prepayment of any of its
Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of
prepayment given by Borrower, or (iv) as a consequence of any other default by
Borrower in the repayment of its Eurodollar Rate Loans when required by the
terms of this Agreement.

                E.      Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any Lender may make,
carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its
branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of that Lender.

                F.      Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar Rate Loans.
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this subsection 2.6 and
under subsection 2.7A shall be made as though that Lender had funded each of its
Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing
interest at the rate obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar
Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period,
whether or not its Eurodollar Rate Loans had been funded in such manner.

                G.      Eurodollar Rate Loans After Default. After the
occurrence of and during the continuation of a Potential Event of Default or an
Event of Default, (i) Borrower may not have a Loan be made or maintained as, or
converted to, a Eurodollar Rate Loan after the expiration of any Interest Period
then in effect for that Loan and (ii) subject to the provisions of subsection
2.6D, any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by
Borrower with respect to a requested borrowing or conversion/continuation that
has not yet occurred shall be deemed to be for a Base Rate Loan or, if the
conditions to making a Loan set forth in subsection 4.2 cannot then be
satisfied, to be rescinded by Borrower.

        2.7     INCREASED COSTS; TAXES; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

                A.      Compensation for Increased Costs. Subject to the
provisions of subsection 2.7B (which shall be controlling with respect to the
matters covered thereby), in the event that any Lender (including any Issuing
Lender) shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty
or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change therein or in the
interpretation, administration or application thereof (including the
introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order),
or any determination of a court or other Government Authority, in each case that
becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender with any
guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date hereof by any
central bank or other Government Authority (whether or not having the force of
law):

                                       54

                (i)     subjects such Lender to any additional Tax with respect
        to this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder (including with
        respect to issuing or maintaining any Letters of Credit or purchasing or
        maintaining any participations therein or maintaining any Commitment
        hereunder) or any payments to such Lender of principal, interest, fees
        or any other amount payable hereunder;

                (ii)    imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve,
        special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
        requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in
        or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended
        by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender
        (other than any such reserve or other requirements with respect to
        Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of Adjusted
        Eurodollar Rate); or

                (iii)   imposes any other condition (other than with respect to
        Taxes, determined without regard to the exclusions contained in the
        definition of Taxes) on or affecting such Lender or its obligations
        hereunder or the London interbank market;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make, making or maintaining its Loans or Commitments or agreeing to
issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to purchase,
purchasing or maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any amount
received or receivable by such Lender with respect thereto; then, in any such
case, Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon receipt of the statement
referred to in subsection 2.8A, such additional amount or amounts (in the form
of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or
otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as may be
necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in
amounts received or receivable hereunder.

                B.      Taxes.

                (i)     Payments to Be Free and Clear. Except as otherwise
        provided herein, all sums payable by Borrower under this Agreement and
        the other Loan Documents shall be paid free and clear of, and without
        any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax imposed, levied,
        collected, withheld or assessed by or within the United States of
        America or any political subdivision in or of the United States of
        America or any other jurisdiction from or to which a payment is made by
        or on behalf of Borrower or by any federation or organization of which
        the United States of America or any such jurisdiction is a member at the
        time of payment.

                (ii)    Grossing-up of Payments. If Borrower or any other Person
        is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of
        any such Tax from any sum paid or payable by Borrower to Administrative
        Agent or any Lender under any of the Loan Documents:

                        (a)     Borrower shall notify Administrative Agent of
                any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as
                soon as Borrower becomes aware of it;

                                       55

<PAGE>

                        (b)     Borrower shall pay any such Tax when such Tax is
                due, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is imposed
                on Borrower) for its own account or (if that liability is
                imposed on Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may
                be) on behalf of and in the name of Administrative Agent or such
                Lender;

                        (c)     the sum payable by Borrower in respect of which
                the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall
                be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the
                making of that deduction, withholding or payment, Administrative
                Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due
                date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such
                deduction, withholding or payment been required or made; and

                        (d)     within 30 days after the later of paying any sum
                from which it is required by law to make any deduction or
                withholding and the due date of payment of any Tax which it is
                required by clause (b) above to pay, Borrower shall deliver to
                Administrative Agent evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
                other affected parties of such deduction, withholding or payment
                and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other
                authority;

provided that no such additional amount shall be required to be paid to
Administrative Agent or any Lender under clause (c) above except to the extent
that any change after the date on which such Lender became a Lender in any such
requirement for a deduction, withholding or payment shall result in an increase
in the rate of such deduction, withholding or payment from that in effect on the
date on which such Lender became a Lender, in respect of payments to or for the
benefit of such Lender.

                (iii)   Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax.

                        (a)     Each Lender shall deliver to Administrative
                Agent and to Borrower, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the
                case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or on
                or prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to
                which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender),
                and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination
                of Borrower or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable
                exercise of its discretion), two original copies of Internal
                Revenue Service Form W-9, W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor
                forms), as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed
                by such Lender, or, in the case of a Non-US Lender claiming
                exemption from United States federal withholding tax under
                Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code with
                respect to payments of "portfolio interest", two original copies
                of a form W-8BEN (or any successor forms), as the case may be,
                properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and, a
                certificate of such Lender certifying that such Lender is not
                (i) a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Internal
                Revenue Code, (ii) a ten-percent shareholder (within the meaning
                of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code) of either
                Credit Agreement Party or (iii) a controlled foreign corporation
                related to either Credit

                                       56

<PAGE>

                Agreement Party (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the
                Internal Revenue Code), in each case together with any other
                certificate or statement of exemption required under the
                Internal Revenue Code or the regulations issued thereunder to
                establish that such Non-US Lender is not subject to United
                States withholding tax with respect to any payments to such
                Lender of (x) with respect to Non-US Lenders that are "banks"
                for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and
                to US Lenders, any amounts, and (y) with respect to Non-US
                Lenders that are not "banks" for purposes of Section 881(c) of
                the Internal Revenue Code, interest payable under any of the
                Loan Documents.

                        (b)     Each Lender, to the extent it does not act or
                ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of
                any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan
                Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation
                by such Lender), shall deliver to Administrative Agent and to
                Borrower, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each
                Lender listed on the signature pages hereof), on or prior to the
                date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a
                Lender (in the case of each other Lender), or on such later date
                when such Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect
                to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such
                other times as may be necessary in the determination of Borrower
                or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its
                discretion), (1) two original copies of the forms or statements
                required to be provided by such Lender under subsection
                2.7B(iii)(a), properly completed and duly executed by such
                Lender, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or
                payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own
                account that is not subject to United States withholding tax,
                and (2) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9
                or W-8IMY (or any successor forms), as the case may be, properly
                completed and duly executed by such Lender, together with any
                information, if any, such Lender chooses or is required to
                transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement
                of exemption required under the Internal Revenue Code or the
                regulations issued thereunder, to establish that such Lender is
                not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any
                such sums payable to such Lender.

                        (c)     Each Lender hereby agrees, from time to time
                after the initial delivery by such Lender of such forms,
                whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such
                forms, certificates or other evidence so delivered obsolete or
                inaccurate in any material respect, that such Lender shall
                promptly (1) deliver to Administrative Agent and to Borrower two
                original copies of renewals, amendments or additional or
                successor forms, properly completed and duly executed by such
                Lender, together with any other certificate or statement of
                exemption required in order to confirm or establish that such
                Lender is not subject to United States withholding tax with
                respect to payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents and,
                if applicable, that such Lender does not act for its own account
                with respect to any portion of such payment, or (2) notify
                Administrative

                                       57

<PAGE>

                Agent and Borrower in writing of its inability to deliver any
                such forms, certificates or other evidence.

                        (d)     Borrower shall not be required to pay any
                additional amount to any Non-US Lender under clause (c) of
                subsection 2.7B(ii), (1) with respect to any Tax required to be
                deducted or withheld on the basis of the information,
                certificates or statements of exemption such Lender chooses to
                transmit with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY pursuant
                to subsection 2.7B(iii)(b)(2) or (2) if such Lender shall have
                failed to satisfy the requirements of clause (a), (b) or (c)(1)
                of this subsection 2.7B(iii); provided that if such Lender shall
                have satisfied the requirements of subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) on
                the date such Lender became a Lender, nothing in this subsection
                2.7B(iii)(d) shall relieve Borrower of its obligation to pay any
                amounts pursuant to subsection 2.7B(ii)(c) in the event that, as
                a result of any change subsequent to the date such Lender became
                a Lender, in any applicable law treaty or governmental rule,
                regulation or order or in the interpretation, administration or
                application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled
                to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent
                date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject to
                withholding as described in subsection 2.7B(iii)(a).

                        (e)     In the event that Administrative Agent or any
                Lender obtains any refund of Taxes in respect of which an
                additional payment amount described in subsection 2.7B(ii)(c)
                was paid, Administrative Agent or such Lender thereupon shall
                repay to Borrower an amount with respect to such refund equal to
                any net reduction in Taxes actually obtained by Administrative
                Agent or such Lender as is attributable to such refund;
                provided, however, that Borrower, upon the request of
                Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount
                paid over to Borrower (plus interest thereon at the rate imposed
                by the applicable taxing authority) to Administrative Agent or
                such Lender in the event Administrative Agent or such Lender is
                required to repay such refund to such taxing authority. Nothing
                in this paragraph shall require Administrative Agent or any
                Lender to make available to Borrower any tax returns or other
                information Administrative Agent or such Lender deems to be
                confidential or proprietary.

                C.      Capital Adequacy Adjustment. If any Lender shall have
determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after the
date hereof of any law, rule or regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding
capital adequacy, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Government Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any
guideline, request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such Government Authority, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to,
such Lender's Loans or Commitments or Letters of Credit or participations
therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or the Letters
of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling
corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase-in,
applicability, change or compliance (taking into consideration the

                                       58

<PAGE>

policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with regard to capital
adequacy), then from time to time, within five Business Days after receipt by
Borrower from such Lender of the statement referred to in subsection 2.8A,
Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation on an after-tax basis for
such reduction.

        2.8     STATEMENT OF LENDERS; OBLIGATION OF LENDERS AND ISSUING LENDERS
                TO MITIGATE.

                A.      Statements. Each Lender claiming compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to subsection 2.6D, 2.7 or 2.8B shall deliver to Borrower
(with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such compensation or
reimbursement, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto absent manifest error.

                B.      Mitigation. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that,
as promptly as practicable after the officer of such Lender or Issuing Lender
responsible for administering the Loans or Letters of Credit of such Lender or
Issuing Lender, as the case may be, becomes aware of the occurrence of an event
or the existence of a condition that would cause such Lender to become an
Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive
payments under subsection 2.7, use reasonable effort to make, issue, fund or
maintain the Commitments of such Lender or the Affected Loans or Letters of
Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender through another lending or letter of
credit office of such Lender or Issuing Lender, if (i) as a result thereof the
circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease
to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid
to such Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to subsection 2.7 would be materially
reduced and (ii) as determined by such Lender or Issuing Lender in its sole
discretion, such action would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or
Issuing Lender; provided that such Lender or Issuing Lender will not be
obligated to utilize such other lending or letter of credit office pursuant to
this subsection 2.8B unless Borrower agrees to pay all incremental expenses
incurred by such Lender or Issuing Lender as a result of utilizing such other
lending or letter of credit office as described above.

        2.9     REPLACEMENT OF A LENDER.

                If Borrower receives a statement of amounts due pursuant to
subsection 2.8A from a Lender, a Revolving Lender defaults in its obligations to
fund a Revolving Loan pursuant to this Agreement, a Lender (a "Non-Consenting
Lender") refuses to consent to an amendment, modification or waiver of this
Agreement that, pursuant to subsection 10.6, requires consent of 100% of the
Lenders or 100% of the Lenders with Obligations directly affected or a Lender
becomes an Affected Lender (any such Lender, a "Subject Lender"), so long as (i)
no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and Borrower has obtained a commitment from another Lender or an
Eligible Assignee to purchase at par the Subject Lender's Loans and assume the
Subject Lender's Commitments and all other obligations of the Subject Lender
hereunder, (ii) such Lender is not an Issuing Lender with respect to any Letters
of Credit outstanding (unless all such Letters of Credit are terminated or
arrangements

                                       59

<PAGE>

acceptable to such Issuing Lender (such as a "back-to-back" letter of credit)
are made) and (iii), if applicable, the Subject Lender is unwilling to withdraw
the notice delivered to Borrower pursuant to subsection 2.8 and/or is unwilling
to remedy its default upon 10 days prior written notice to the Subject Lender
and Administrative Agent, Borrower may require the Subject Lender to assign all
of its Loans and Commitments to such other Lender, Lenders, Eligible Assignee or
Eligible Assignees pursuant to the provisions of subsection 10.1B; provided
that, prior to or concurrently with such replacement, (1) the Subject Lender
shall have received payment in full of all principal, interest, fees and other
amounts (including all amounts under subsections 2.6D, 2.7 and/or 2.8B (if
applicable)) through such date of replacement and a release from its obligations
under the Loan Documents, (2) the processing fee required to be paid by
subsection 10.1B(i) shall have been paid to Administrative Agent, (3) all of the
requirements for such assignment contained in subsection 10.1B, including,
without limitation, the consent of Administrative Agent (if required) and the
receipt by Administrative Agent of an executed Assignment Agreement and other
supporting documents, have been fulfilled, and (4) in the event such Subject
Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, each assignee shall consent, at the time of
such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Subject Lender was a
Non-Consenting Lender and Borrower also requires each other Subject Lender that
is a Non-Consenting Lender to assign its Loans and Commitments.

Section 3.      LETTERS OF CREDIT

        3.1     ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND LENDERS' PURCHASE OF
                PARTICIPATIONS THEREIN.

                A.      Letters of Credit. In addition to Borrower requesting
that Lenders make Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 2.1A(ii) and that Swing
Line Lender make Swing Line Loans pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iii), Borrower may
request, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1, from time to
time during the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the 30th day prior
to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, that one or more Revolving
Lenders issue Letters of Credit payable on a sight basis for the account of
Borrower for the purposes specified in the definitions of Commercial Letters of
Credit and Standby Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of
Borrower herein set forth, any one or more Lenders may, but (except as provided
in subsection 3.1B(ii)) shall not be obligated to, issue such Letters of Credit
in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1; provided that Borrower
shall not request that any Revolving Lender issue (and no Revolving Lender shall
issue):

                (i)     any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
        issuance, the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments would
        exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect;

                (ii)    any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
        issuance, the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $35,000,000;

                (iii)   any Standby Letter of Credit having an expiration date
        later than the earlier of (a) ten days prior to the Revolving Loan
        Commitment Termination Date and

                                       60

<PAGE>

        (b) the date which is one year from the date of issuance of such Standby
        Letter of Credit; provided that the immediately preceding clause (b)
        shall not prevent any Issuing Lender from agreeing that a Standby Letter
        of Credit will automatically be extended for one or more successive
        periods not to exceed one year each unless such Issuing Lender elects
        not to extend for any such additional period; and provided, further that
        such Issuing Lender shall elect not to extend such Standby Letter of
        Credit if it has knowledge that an Event of Default has occurred and is
        continuing (and has not been waived in accordance with subsection 10.6)
        at the time such Issuing Lender must elect whether or not to allow such
        extension;

                (iv)    any Standby Letter of Credit issued for the purpose of
        supporting (a) trade payables or (b) any Indebtedness constituting
        "antecedent debt" (as that term is used in Section 547 of the Bankruptcy
        Code);

                (v)     any Commercial Letter of Credit having an expiration
        date (a) later than the earlier of (1) the date which is 30 days prior
        to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date and (2) the date which
        is 180 days from the date of issuance of such Commercial Letter of
        Credit or (b) that is otherwise unacceptable to the applicable Issuing
        Lender in its reasonable discretion; or

                (vi)    any Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other
        than Dollars.

                B.      Mechanics of Issuance.

                (i)     Request for Issuance. Whenever Borrower desires the
        issuance of a Letter of Credit, it shall deliver to the applicable
        Issuing Lender a Request for Issuance no later than 12:00 Noon (New York
        City time) at least three Business Days (in the case of Standby Letters
        of Credit) or five Business Days (in the case of Commercial Letters of
        Credit), or in each case such shorter period as may be agreed to by such
        Issuing Lender in any particular instance, in advance of the proposed
        date of issuance. Issuing Lender, in its reasonable discretion, may
        require changes in the text of the proposed Letter of Credit or any
        documents described in or attached to the Request for Issuance. In
        furtherance of the provisions of subsection 10.8, and not in limitation
        thereof, Borrower may submit Requests for Issuance by telefacsimile and
        Administrative Agent and Issuing Lenders may rely and act upon any such
        Request for Issuance without receiving an original signed copy thereof.
        No Letter of Credit shall require payment against a conforming demand
        for payment to be made thereunder on the same business day (under the
        laws of the jurisdiction in which the office of the Issuing Lender to
        which such demand for payment is required to be presented is located)
        that such demand for payment is presented if such presentation is made
        after 10:00 A.M. (in the time zone of such office of such Issuing
        Lender) on such business day.

                Borrower shall notify the applicable Issuing Lender and
        Administrative Agent prior to the issuance of any Letter of Credit in
        the event that any of the matters to which Borrower is required to
        certify in the applicable Request for Issuance is no longer true and
        correct as of the proposed date of issuance of such Letter of Credit,
        and upon the

                                       61

<PAGE>

        issuance of any Letter of Credit, Borrower shall be deemed to have
        re-certified, as of the date of such issuance, as to the matters to
        which Borrower is required to certify in the applicable Request for
        Issuance.

                (ii)    Determination of Issuing Lender. Borrower may request
        either Issuing Lender to issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such
        Issuing Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a Request for
        Issuance. Issuing Lenders shall be obligated to issue any Letter of
        Credit, notwithstanding the fact that the Letter of Credit Usage with
        respect to such Letter of Credit and with respect to all other Letters
        of Credit issued by Issuing Lender, when aggregated with Issuing
        Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans, may exceed
        Issuing Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment then in effect.

                (iii)   Issuance of Letter of Credit. Upon satisfaction or
        waiver (in accordance with subsection 10.6) of the conditions set forth
        in subsection 4.3, the Issuing Lender shall issue the requested Letter
        of Credit in accordance with the Issuing Lender's standard operating
        procedures.

                (iv)    Notification to Revolving Lenders. Upon the issuance of
        or amendment to any Standby Letter of Credit the applicable Issuing
        Lender shall promptly notify Administrative Agent and Borrower of such
        issuance or amendment in writing and such notice shall be accompanied by
        a copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. Upon receipt of such
        notice, Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender in
        writing of such issuance or amendment and the amount of such Revolving
        Lender's respective participation in such Standby Letter of Credit or
        amendment. In the case of Commercial Letters of Credit, such Issuing
        Lender will send by facsimile transmission to Administrative Agent,
        promptly upon the first Business Day of each week, a report of its daily
        aggregate maximum amount available for drawing under Commercial Letters
        of Credit for the previous week. Administrative Agent shall notify each
        Revolving Lender in writing of the contents thereof.

                C.      Revolving Lenders' Purchase of Participations in Letters
of Credit. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have irrevocably
purchased from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and
any drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's
Pro Rata Share of the maximum amount that is or at any time may become available
to be drawn thereunder.

        3.2     LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

                Borrower agrees to pay the following amounts with respect to
Letters of Credit issued hereunder:

                (i)     with respect to each Standby Letter of Credit, (a) a
        fronting fee, payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its
        own account, equal to (the greater of (x) $500 and (y) 0.25% per annum
        of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Standby Letter of
        Credit and (b) a letter of credit fee, payable to Administrative Agent
        for

                                       62

<PAGE>

        the account of Revolving Lenders, equal to the applicable Eurodollar
        Rate Margin for Revolving Loans multiplied by the daily amount available
        to be drawn under such Standby Letter of Credit, each such fronting fee
        or letter of credit fee to be payable in arrears on and to (but
        excluding) the last Business Day of March, June, September and December
        of each year and on and to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination
        Date and computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number
        of days elapsed;

                (ii)    with respect to each Commercial Letter of Credit, (a) a
        fronting fee, payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its
        own account, equal to the greater of (x) $1,000 and (y) 0.25% per annum
        of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Commercial Letter
        of Credit and (b) a letter of credit fee, payable to Administrative
        Agent for the account of Revolving Lenders, equal to the applicable
        Eurodollar Rate Margin for Revolving Loans multiplied by the daily
        amount available to be drawn under such Commercial Letter of Credit,
        each such fronting fee or letter of credit fee to be payable in arrears
        on and to (but excluding) the last Business Day of March, June,
        September and December of each year and on and to the Revolving Loan
        Commitment Termination Date and computed on the basis of a 360-day year
        for the actual number of days elapsed; and

                (iii)   with respect to the issuance, amendment or transfer of
        each Letter of Credit and each payment of a drawing made thereunder
        (without duplication of the fees payable under clauses (i) and (ii)
        above), documentary and processing charges payable directly to the
        applicable Issuing Lender for its own account in accordance with such
        Issuing Lender's standard schedule for such charges in effect at the
        time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may
        be.

                (iv)    For purposes of calculating any fees payable under
        clauses (i) and (ii) of this subsection 3.2, the daily amount available
        to be drawn under any Letter of Credit shall be determined as of the
        close of business on any date of determination. Promptly upon receipt by
        Administrative Agent of any amount described in clause (i)(b) or (ii)(b)
        of this subsection 3.2, Administrative Agent shall distribute to each
        Revolving Lender its Pro Rata Share of such amount.

        3.3     DRAWINGS AND REIMBURSEMENT OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF
                CREDIT.

                A.      Responsibility of Issuing Lender With Respect to
Drawings. In determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit
by the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to
examine the documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care
so as to ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in strict compliance
with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

                B.      Reimbursement by Borrower of Amounts Paid Under Letters
of Credit. In the event an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing
under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall immediately
notify Borrower and Administrative Agent, and Borrower shall reimburse such
Issuing Lender on the date on which such drawing is honored (the "Reimbursement
Date") in an amount in Dollars and in same day funds equal to

                                       63

<PAGE>

the amount of such payment; provided that, anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless Borrower shall have notified
Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York City
time) on the date such drawing is honored that Borrower intends to reimburse
such Issuing Lender for the amount of such payment with funds other than the
proceeds of Revolving Loans, Borrower shall be deemed to have given a timely
Notice of Borrowing to Administrative Agent requesting Revolving Lenders to make
Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount
in Dollars equal to the amount of such payment and (ii) subject to satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions specified in subsection 4.2B, Revolving Lenders
shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans
in the amount of such payment, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly
by Administrative Agent to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of such
payment; and provided, further that if for any reason proceeds of Revolving
Loans are not received by such Issuing Lender on the Reimbursement Date in an
amount equal to the amount of such payment, Borrower shall reimburse such
Issuing Lender, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal to the excess of
the amount of such payment over the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans, if
any, which are so received. Nothing in this subsection 3.3B shall be deemed to
relieve any Revolving Lender from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and Borrower shall retain any
and all rights it may have against any Revolving Lender resulting from the
failure of such Revolving Lender to make such Revolving Loans under this
subsection 3.3B.

                C.      Payment by Lenders of Unreimbursed Amounts Paid Under
Letters of Credit.

                (i)     Payment by Revolving Lenders. In the event that Borrower
        shall fail for any reason to reimburse any Issuing Lender as provided in
        subsection 3.3B in an amount equal to the amount of any payment by such
        Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing
        Lender shall promptly notify Administrative Agent who will notify each
        other Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such honored drawing and of
        such other Revolving Lender's respective participation therein based on
        such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share. Each Revolving Lender shall make
        available to Administrative Agent for the benefit of such Issuing Lender
        an amount equal to its respective participation, in Dollars and in same
        day funds, at the Funding and Payment Office, not later than 12:00 Noon
        (New York City time) on the first business day after the date notified
        by such Issuing Lender. In the event that any Revolving Lender fails to
        make available to Administrative Agent for the benefit of such Issuing
        Lender on such business day the amount of such Revolving Lender's
        participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this subsection
        3.3C, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on
        demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the
        rate customarily used by such Issuing Lender for the correction of
        errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base
        Rate. Nothing in this subsection 3.3C shall be deemed to prejudice the
        right of any Lender to recover from any Issuing Lender any amounts made
        available by such Revolving Lender to such Issuing Lender pursuant to
        this subsection 3.3C in the event that it is determined by the final
        judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with
        respect to a Letter of Credit by such

                                       64

<PAGE>

        Issuing Lender in respect of which payment was made by such Revolving
        Lender constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
        such Issuing Lender.

                (ii)    Distribution to Lenders of Reimbursements Received From
        Borrower. In the event any Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by
        other Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any
        portion of any payment by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit
        issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall distribute to Administrative
        Agent on behalf of each other Revolving Lender that has paid all amounts
        payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such payment such
        other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments subsequently
        received by such Issuing Lender from Company in reimbursement of such
        payment under the Letter of Credit when such payments are received. Any
        such distribution shall be made to a Revolving Lender.

                D.      Interest on Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.

                (i)     Payment of Interest by Borrower. Borrower agrees to pay
        to each Issuing Lender, with respect to payments under any Letters of
        Credit issued by it, interest on the amount paid by such Issuing Lender
        in respect of each such payment from the date a drawing is honored to
        but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by Borrower (including
        any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of Revolving Loans pursuant
        to subsection 3.3B) at a rate equal to (a) for the period from the date
        such drawing is honored to but excluding the Reimbursement Date, the
        rate then in effect under this Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans
        that are Base Rate Loans and (b) thereafter, a rate which is 2% per
        annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable under this
        Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans.
        Interest payable pursuant to this subsection 3.3D(i) shall be computed
        on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed in
        the period during which it accrues and shall be payable on demand or, if
        no demand is made, on the date on which the related drawing under a
        Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full.

                (ii)    Distribution of Interest Payments by Issuing Lender.
        Promptly upon receipt by any Issuing Lender of any payment of interest
        pursuant to subsection 3.3D(i) with respect to a payment under a Letter
        of Credit issued by it, (a) such Issuing Lender shall distribute to
        Administrative Agent on behalf of each other Revolving Lender, out of
        the interest received by such Issuing Lender in respect of the period
        from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date on which
        such Issuing Lender is reimbursed for the amount of such payment
        (including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of Revolving Loans
        pursuant to subsection 3.3B), the amount that such other Revolving
        Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the letter of
        credit fee that would have been payable in respect of such Letter of
        Credit for such period pursuant to subsection 3.2 if no drawing had been
        honored under such Letter of Credit, and (b) in the event such Issuing
        Lender shall have been reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders pursuant to
        subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any portion of such payment, such Issuing
        Lender shall distribute to Administrative Agent on behalf of each other
        Revolving Lender that has paid all amounts payable by it under
        subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such payment such other Revolving
        Lender's Pro Rata Share of any interest received by such

                                       65

<PAGE>

        Issuing Lender in respect of that portion of such payment so reimbursed
        by other Revolving Lenders for the period from the date on which such
        Issuing Lender was so reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders to but
        excluding the date on which such portion of such payment is reimbursed
        by Borrower. Administrative Agent shall distribute any such amounts to a
        Revolving Lender.

        3.4     OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE.

                The obligation of Borrower to reimburse each Issuing Lender for
payments under the Letters of Credit issued by it and to repay any Revolving
Loans made by Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3B and the obligations
of Revolving Lenders under subsection 3.1C and 3.3C(i) shall be unconditional
and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement under all circumstances including any of the following circumstances:

                (i)     any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
        Credit;

                (ii)    the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
        right which Borrower or any Lender may have at any time against a
        beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons
        for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Lender or other
        Revolving Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a Revolving
        Lender, against Borrower, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
        transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including
        any underlying transaction between Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries
        and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured);

                (iii)   any draft or other document presented under any Letter
        of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in
        any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
        respect;

                (iv)    payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under any
        Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document which
        does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

                (v)     any adverse change in the business, operations,
        properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of
        Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

                (vi)    any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
        by any party thereto;

                (vii)   any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
        or not similar to any of the foregoing; or

                (viii)  the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential Event
        of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

provided, in each case, that payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under the
applicable Letter of Credit shall not have constituted gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Issuing

                                       66

<PAGE>

Lender under the circumstances in question (as determined by a final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction).

        3.5     NATURE OF ISSUING LENDERS' DUTIES.

                As between Borrower and any Issuing Lender, Borrower assumes all
risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by
such Issuing Lender by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Lender shall
not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection
with the application for and issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it
should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any
instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any
such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof,
in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any
reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply
fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit;
(iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of
any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they
be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or
delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make
a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the
misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds
of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising
from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Lender, including any act or
omission by a Government Authority, and none of the above shall affect or
impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of such Issuing Lender's rights or powers
hereunder.

                In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specific provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 3.5, any
action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with the
Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered
thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender
under any resulting liability to Borrower.

                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
subsection 3.5, Borrower shall retain any and all rights it may have against any
Issuing Lender for any liability arising solely out of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender, as determined by a final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction.

had and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
to enter into the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to carry out the
transactions contemplated thereby.

                B.      Qualification and Good Standing. Each of Company and its
Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and in good standing in every
jurisdiction where its assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out
its business and operations, except in

                                       76

<PAGE>

jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not
had and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                C.      Conduct of Business. Each of Company and its
Subsidiaries is engaged only in the businesses permitted to be engaged in
pursuant to subsection 7.11.

                D.      Subsidiaries. All of the Subsidiaries of each Credit
Agreement Party and their jurisdictions of organization are identified in
Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto, as said Schedule 5.1 may be supplemented from time
to time pursuant to the provisions of subsection 6.1(xiv). The Capital Stock of
each of the Subsidiaries of each Credit Agreement Party identified in Schedule
5.1 annexed hereto (as so supplemented) is duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and none of such Capital Stock constitutes Margin
Stock. Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto (as so supplemented) correctly sets forth the
ownership interest of each Credit Agreement Party and each of its Subsidiaries
in each of the Subsidiaries identified therein.

        5.2     AUTHORIZATION OF BORROWING, ETC.

                A.      Authorization of Borrowing. The execution, delivery and
performance of the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of each Loan Party that is a party thereto.

                B.      No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by
Loan Parties of the Loan Documents to which they are parties and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents do not and
will not (i) violate any provision of any law or any governmental rule or
regulation applicable to any Credit Agreement Party or any of its Subsidiaries,
the Organizational Documents of any Credit Agreement Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or any order, judgment or decree of any court or other Government
Authority binding on any Credit Agreement Party or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default under any Contractual Obligation of any Credit Agreement
Party or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) result in or require the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of any Credit
Agreement Party or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Liens created under
any of the Loan Documents in favor of Administrative Agent on behalf of
Lenders), or (iv) require any approval of stockholders or any approval or
consent of any Person under any Contractual Obligation of any Credit Agreement
Party or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such approvals or consents which
will be obtained on or before the Closing Date and disclosed in writing to
Lenders.

                C.      Governmental Consents. The execution, delivery and
performance by Loan Parties of the Loan Documents to which they are parties and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents do not
and will not require any Governmental Authorization.

                D.      Binding Obligation. Each of the Loan Documents has been
duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party that is a party thereto and is
the legally valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable against
such Loan Party in accordance with its respective terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

                                       77

<PAGE>

moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally
or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.

                E.      Valid Issuance of Senior Notes. Borrower has the
corporate power and authority to issue the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes, when
issued and paid for, will be legally valid and binding obligations of Borrower,
enforceable against Borrower in accordance with their respective terms. The
Senior Notes, when issued and sold, will either (a) have been registered or
qualified under applicable federal and state securities laws or (b) be exempt
therefrom.

        5.3     FINANCIAL CONDITION.

                Borrower has heretofore delivered to Lenders, at Lenders'
request, the financial statements and information set forth in Schedule 4.1E.
All such statements other than pro forma financial statements were prepared in
conformity with GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
position (on a consolidated and, where applicable, consolidating basis) of the
entities described in such financial statements as at the respective dates
thereof and the results of operations and cash flows (on a consolidated and,
where applicable, consolidating basis) of the entities described therein for
each of the periods then ended, subject, in the case of any such unaudited
financial statements, to changes resulting from audit and normal year-end
adjustments. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (and will not have
following the funding of the initial Loans) any Contingent Obligation,
contingent liability or liability for taxes, long-term lease or unusual forward
or long-term commitment that, as of the Closing Date, is not reflected in the
foregoing financial statements or the notes thereto and, as of any Funding Date
subsequent to the Closing Date, is not reflected in the most recent financial
statements delivered to Lenders pursuant to subsection 6.1 or the notes thereto
and that, in any such case, is material in relation to the business, operations,
properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

        5.4     NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT; NO RESTRICTED JUNIOR PAYMENTS.

                Since December 31, 2002, no event or change has occurred that
has resulted in or evidences, either in any case or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has directly or
indirectly declared, ordered, paid or made, or set apart any sum or property
for, any Restricted Junior Payment or agreed to do so except as permitted by
subsection 7.5.

        5.5     TITLE TO PROPERTIES; LIENS; REAL PROPERTY; INTELLECTUAL
                PROPERTY.

                A.      Title to Properties; Liens. Company and its Subsidiaries
have (i) good, sufficient and legal title to (in the case of fee interests in
real property), (ii) valid leasehold interests in (in the case of leasehold
interests in real or personal property), or (iii) good title to (in the case of
all other personal property), all of their respective properties and assets
reflected in the financial statements referred to in subsection 5.3 or in the
most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to subsection 6.1, in each
case except for assets disposed of since the date of such financial statements
in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise permitted under

                                       78

<PAGE>

subsection 7.7. Except as permitted by this Agreement, all such properties and
assets are free and clear of Liens.

                B.      Real Property. As of the Closing Date, Schedule 5.5B
annexed hereto contains a true, accurate and complete list of (i) all fee
interests in any Real Property Assets and (ii) all leases, subleases or
assignments of leases (together with all amendments, modifications, supplements,
renewals or extensions of any thereof) affecting each Real Property Asset,
regardless of whether a Loan Party is the landlord, tenant or subtenant (whether
directly or as an assignee or successor in interest) under such lease, sublease
or assignment. Except as specified in Schedule 5.5B annexed hereto, each
agreement listed in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is in full
force and effect and neither Credit Agreement Party has knowledge of any default
that has occurred and is continuing thereunder, and each such agreement
constitutes the legally valid and binding obligation of each applicable Loan
Party, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally
or by equitable principles.

                C.      Intellectual Property. As of the Closing Date, Company
and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use, all Intellectual Property
used in the conduct of their business, except where the failure to own or have
such right to use in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. No claim has been asserted and is pending by any
Person challenging or questioning the use of any such Intellectual Property or
the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property, nor does either
Credit Agreement Party know of any valid basis for any such claim, except for
such claims that in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. The use of such Intellectual Property by Company and
its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any Person, except for such
claims and infringements that, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. All federal and state and all
foreign registrations of and applications for Intellectual Property, and all
unregistered Intellectual Property, that are owned or licensed by Company or any
of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date are described on Schedule 5.5C annexed
hereto.

        5.6     LITIGATION; ADVERSE FACTS.

                Except as set forth in Schedule 5.6 annexed hereto, there are no
Proceedings (whether or not purportedly on behalf of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) at law or in equity, or before or by any court or other Government
Authority (including any Environmental Claims) that are pending or, to the
knowledge of an Officer of either Credit Agreement Party, threatened against or
affecting Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any property of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries (i) is in violation of any applicable laws (including
Environmental Laws) that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) is subject to or in
default with respect to any final judgments, writs, injunctions, decrees, rules
or regulations of any court or other Government Authority that, individually or
in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

        5.7     PAYMENT OF TAXES.

                Except to the extent permitted by subsection 6.3 (as if the
proviso in subsection 6.3 was contained in this subsection 5.7), (i) all tax
returns and reports of Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed by any
of them have been timely filed (taking into account all valid extensions of time
for filing), and (ii) all taxes shown on such tax returns to be due and payable
and all assessments, fees and other governmental charges upon Company and its
Subsidiaries and upon their respective properties, assets, income, businesses
and franchises that are due and payable have been timely paid. Neither Credit
Agreement Party knows of any proposed tax assessment against Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is not being contested by Company or such Subsidiary in
good faith and by appropriate proceedings; provided that such reserves or other
appropriate provisions, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP
shall have been made or provided therefor.

        5.8     PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS; MATERIAL CONTRACTS.

                A.      Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations,
covenants or conditions contained in any of its Contractual Obligations, and no
condition exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both,
would constitute such a default, except where the consequences, direct or
indirect, of such default or defaults, if any, could not reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                B.      Part A of Schedule 5.8 contains a true, correct and
complete list of all the Material Contracts in effect on the Closing Date.
Except as described on Part A of Schedule 5.8, all such Material Contracts are
in full force and effect and no material defaults currently exist thereunder.

        5.9     GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.

                Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or
under any other federal or state statute or regulation which may limit its
ability to incur Indebtedness or which may otherwise render all or any portion
of the Obligations unenforceable.

        5.10    SECURITIES ACTIVITIES.

                A.      Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock.

                B.      Following application of the proceeds of each Loan, not
more than 25% of the value of the assets (whether of either Credit Agreement
Party only or of such Credit Agreement Party and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis) subject to the provisions of subsection 7.2 or 7.7 or
subject to any restriction contained in any agreement or instrument,

                                       80

<PAGE>

between either Credit Agreement Party and any Lender or any Affiliate of any
Lender, relating to Indebtedness and within the scope of subsection 8.2, will be
Margin Stock.

        5.11    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

                A.      Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective ERISA Affiliates are in compliance with all applicable provisions and
requirements of ERISA and the regulations and published interpretations
thereunder with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, and have performed all
their obligations under each Employee Benefit Plan, except for such instances of
noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a
determination from the Internal Revenue Service that such plan is so qualified
as to its form, and to the Company's knowledge, each such Employee Benefit Plan
has not been operated in any way that would result in such Employee Benefit Plan
no longer being qualified.

                B.      During the five-year period prior to the date on which
this representation has been made or deemed made, no ERISA Event has occurred
that has resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Material
Adverse Effect.

                C.      The expected post retirement benefit obligation
(determined as of the last day of the Company's most recently ended fiscal year
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106,
without regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by
Section 4980B of the Code) of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates is not and
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                D.      As of the most recent valuation date for any Pension
Plan, the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities (as defined in Section
4001(a)(18) of ERISA), individually or in the aggregate for all Pension Plans
(excluding for purposes of such computation any Pension Plans with respect to
which assets exceed benefit liabilities) could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                E.      Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA
Affiliates have not incurred withdrawal liabilities under Section 4201 or 4204
of ERISA in respect to Multiemployer Plans that, individually or in the
aggregate would result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                F.      As of the date hereof, Company and its Subsidiaries have
made full payment when due of all required contributions to any Foreign Plan,
except where such failure to make full payment has not resulted in and could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

        5.12    CERTAIN FEES.

                No broker's or finder's fee or commission will be payable with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
Borrower, and on and after the

                                       81

<PAGE>

Qualified Holding Company Formation Date, each of Borrower and Holdings, jointly
and severally, hereby indemnifies Lenders against, and agrees that they will
hold Lenders harmless from, any claim, demand or liability for any such broker's
or finder's fees alleged to have been incurred in connection herewith or
therewith and any expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of counsel) arising in connection with any such claim, demand or
liability.

        5.13    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

                Except  as set forth in Schedule 5.13 annexed hereto:

                (i)     neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
        their respective Facilities or operations are subject to any outstanding
        written order, consent decree or settlement agreement with any Person
        relating to (a) any Environmental Law, (b) any Environmental Claim, or
        (c) any Hazardous Materials Activity;

                (ii)    neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
        any letter or request for information under Section 104 of the
        Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
        (42 U.S.C. Section 9604) or any comparable state law;

                (iii)   there are and, to each Credit Agreement Party's
        knowledge, have been no conditions, occurrences, or Hazardous Materials
        Activities that could reasonably be expected to form the basis of an
        Environmental Claim against Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

                (iv)    Commencing at least 5 years prior to the Closing Date,
        Company has maintained an environmental management system for its and
        each of Subsidiaries' operations that demonstrates a commitment to
        environmental compliance and includes procedures for (a) tracking
        changes in applicable Environmental Laws and modifying operations to
        comply with new requirements thereunder, (b) training employees to
        comply with applicable environmental requirements and updating such
        training as necessary, (c) performing regular internal compliance audits
        of each Facility and ensuring to establish methods of correction of any
        incidents of non-compliance detected by means of such audits, and (d)
        reviewing the compliance status of off-site hazardous waste disposal
        facilities;

                (v)     compliance with all current or reasonably foreseeable
        future requirements pursuant to or under Environmental Laws would not,
        individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in a
        Material Adverse Effect.

        5.14    EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

                There is no strike or work stoppage in existence or threatened
involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       82

<PAGE>

        5.15    SOLVENCY.

                Each Loan Party is and, upon the incurrence of any Obligations
by such Loan Party on any date on which this representation is made, will be,
Solvent.

        5.16    MATTERS RELATING TO COLLATERAL.

                A.      Creation, Perfection and Priority of Liens. The
execution and delivery of the Collateral Documents by Loan Parties, together
with (i) the actions taken on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to
subsections 4.1L, 4.1M, 6.8 and 6.9 and (ii) the delivery to Administrative
Agent of any Pledged Collateral not delivered to Administrative Agent at the
time of execution and delivery of the applicable Collateral Document (all of
which Pledged Collateral has been so delivered) are effective to create in favor
of Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders, as security for the
respective Secured Obligations (as defined in the applicable Collateral Document
in respect of any Collateral), a valid First Priority Lien on all of the
Collateral, and all filings and other actions necessary or desirable to perfect
and maintain the perfection and First Priority status of such Liens have been
duly made or taken and remain in full force and effect, other than the filing of
any UCC financing statements delivered to Administrative Agent for filing (but
not yet filed) and the periodic filing of UCC continuation statements in respect
of UCC financing statements filed by or on behalf of Administrative Agent.

                B.      Foreign Intercompany Collateral. The execution and
delivery of the Foreign Intercompany Security Agreements will be effective to
create in favor of Borrower or Additives, as the case may be, a legal, valid and
enforceable First Priority Lien on each Foreign Subsidiary Payor's right, title
and interest in and to the Foreign Intercompany Collateral. Each Foreign
Subsidiary Payor has good and marketable title to all the Foreign Intercompany
Collateral, free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens permitted hereunder.
Pursuant to the Foreign Intercompany Security Agreements, all right, title, and
interest of each Foreign Subsidiary Payor in and to the Foreign Intercompany
Collateral will be pledged to Borrower or Additives, as the case may be. The
Foreign Intercompany Security Agreements are effective to create in favor of
Borrower or Additives, as the case may be, a legal, valid and enforceable First
Priority Lien on the Foreign Intercompany Collateral.

                C.      Governmental Authorizations. No authorization, approval
or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Government Authority is
required for either (i) the pledge or grant by any Loan Party of the Liens
purported to be created in favor of Administrative Agent pursuant to any of the
Collateral Documents or (ii) the exercise by Administrative Agent of any rights
or remedies in respect of any Collateral (whether specifically granted or
created pursuant to any of the Collateral Documents or created or provided for
by applicable law), except for filings or recordings contemplated by subsection
5.16A and except as may be required, in connection with the disposition of any
Pledged Collateral, by laws generally affecting the offering and sale of
securities.

                D.      Absence of Third-Party Filings. Except such as may have
been filed in favor of Administrative Agent as contemplated by subsection 5.16A
and to evidence permitted lease obligations and other Liens permitted pursuant
to subsection 7.2, (i) no effective UCC

                                       83

<PAGE>

financing statement, fixture filing or other instrument similar in effect
covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file in any filing or recording
office and (ii) no effective filing covering all or any part of the IP
Collateral is on file in the PTO.

                E.      Margin Regulations. The pledge of the Pledged Collateral
pursuant to the Collateral Documents does not violate Regulation T, U or X of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

                F.      Information Regarding Collateral. All information
supplied to Administrative Agent by or on behalf of any Loan Party with respect
to any of the Collateral (other than search results of all effective UCC
financing statements and fixture filings and search results in connection with
the IP Collateral, in each case, supplied by a third party), in each case taken
as a whole with respect to any particular Collateral, is accurate and complete
in all material respects.

        5.17    DISCLOSURE.

                No representation or warranty of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries contained in the Confidential Information Memorandum or in any Loan
Document or in any other document, certificate or written statement furnished to
Lenders by or on behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact (known to
Company, in the case of any document not furnished by it) necessary in order to
make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances in which the same were made. Any projections and pro forma
financial information contained in such materials are based upon good faith
estimates and assumptions believed by Credit Agreement Parties to be reasonable
at the time made, it being recognized by Lenders that such projections as to
future events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during the
period or periods covered by any such projections may differ from the projected
results. There are no facts known (or which should upon the reasonable exercise
of diligence be known) to Company (other than matters of a general economic
nature) that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect and that have not been disclosed herein or
in such other documents, certificates and statements furnished to Lenders for
use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.      CREDIT AGREEMENT PARTIES' AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

                Each Credit Agreement Party covenants and agrees that, so long

        or (c) of the occurrence of any event or change that has caused or

        reasonable detail and certified by the chief financial officer of
        Company that they fairly present, in all material respects, the
        financial condition of Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates

have become due and payable and that by law have or may become a Lien upon any
of its properties or assets, prior to the time when any penalty or fine shall be
incurred with respect thereto; provided that no such tax, assessment, charge or
claim need be paid if it is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings timely instituted and diligently conducted, so long as (i) such
reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required in
conformity with GAAP shall have been made therefor and (ii) in the case of a

assets, properties and businesses of Company and its Subsidiaries as may
customarily be carried or maintained under similar circumstances by corporations
of established reputation engaged in similar businesses, in each case in such
amounts (giving effect to self-insurance), with such deductibles, covering such
risks and otherwise on such terms and conditions as shall be customary for
corporations similarly situated in the industry. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Each Credit Agreement Party will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, maintain or cause to be maintained (i) flood insurance with
respect to each Flood Hazard Property that is located in a community that
participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, in each case in compliance

System, and (ii) replacement value casualty insurance on the Collateral under
such policies of insurance, with such insurance companies, in such amounts, with
such deductibles, and covering such risks as are at all times satisfactory to
Administrative Agent in its commercially reasonable judgment. Each such policy
of insurance shall (a) name Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders as
an additional insured thereunder as its interests may appear and (b) in the case
of each business interruption and casualty insurance policy, contain a loss
payable clause or endorsement, satisfactory in form and substance to
Administrative Agent, that names Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders
as the loss payee thereunder for any covered loss in excess of $1,000,000 and
provides for at least 30 days prior written notice to Administrative Agent of
any modification or cancellation of such policy.

        or any of its Subsidiaries of any business interruption insurance
        proceeds constituting Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, (a) so long

        capital purposes, and (b) if an Event of Default or Potential Event of
        Default shall have

                                       90

        more of its Subsidiaries to, promptly and diligently apply such Net
        Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to pay or reimburse the costs of
        repairing, restoring or replacing the assets in respect of which such
        Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds were received or, to the extent not
        so applied, to prepay the Loans (and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments
        shall be reduced) as provided in subsection 2.4B, and (b) if an Event of
        Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred and be
        continuing, Borrower shall apply an amount equal to such Net
        Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to prepay the Loans (and/or the

        Administrative Agent. Upon receipt by Administrative Agent of any Net

        expected to be received) by Administrative Agent in respect of any
        covered loss exceeds $2,000,000, or if and to the extent Borrower would
        have been required to apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds (if

        Loans and/or reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments, Administrative Agent
        shall, and Borrower hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to, apply

        received (and reasonably expected to be received) by Administrative
        Agent in respect of any covered loss does not exceed $1,000,000,
        Administrative Agent shall deliver such Net Insurance/Condemnation
        Proceeds to Borrower, and each Credit Agreement Party shall, or shall
        cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, promptly apply such Net
        Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to the costs of repairing, restoring, or
        replacing the assets in respect of which such Net Insurance/Condemnation

        Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds received (and reasonably expected to be

        $1,000,000, Administrative Agent shall hold such Net
        Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds pursuant to the terms of the Security
        Agreement and, so long as each Credit Agreement Party or any of its
        Subsidiaries proceeds diligently to repair, restore or replace the
        assets of Company or such Subsidiary in respect of which such Net
        Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds were received, Administrative Agent
        shall from time to time disburse to Borrower or such Subsidiary of

        relating to the amount of costs so incurred and the work performed
        (including, if required by Administrative Agent, lien releases and
        architects' certificates); provided, however that if at any time
        Administrative Agent reasonably determines (A) that Company or any
        Subsidiary of Company is not proceeding diligently with such repair,
        restoration or replacement or (B) that such repair, restoration or
        replacement cannot be completed with the Net Insurance/Condemnation

        7.2     LIENS AND RELATED MATTERS.

                A.      Prohibition on Liens. Each Credit Agreement Party shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or permit to exist any Lien on or with respect to any
property or asset of any kind (including any document or instrument in respect
of goods or accounts receivable) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income or profits therefrom, or file or
permit the filing of, or permit to remain in effect, any financing statement or
other similar notice of any Lien with respect to any such property, asset,
income or profits under the UCC or under any similar recording or notice
statute, except:

                (i)     Permitted Encumbrances;

                (ii)    Liens on any asset existing at the time of acquisition
        of such asset by Borrower or a Subsidiary of Company, or Liens to secure
        the payment of all or any part of the purchase price of an asset upon
        the acquisition of such asset by Borrower or a Subsidiary of Company or
        to secure any Indebtedness permitted hereby incurred by Borrower or a
        Subsidiary of Company at the time of or with ninety days after the
        acquisition of such asset, which Indebtedness is incurred for the
        purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price thereof;
        provided, however, that the Lien shall apply only to the asset so
        acquired and proceeds thereof; and provided further, that all such Liens
        do not in the aggregate secure Indebtedness in excess of $5,000,000 at
        any time;

                (iii)   Liens on assets of a Person that becomes a direct or
        indirect Subsidiary of Company after the date of this Agreement,
        provided, however, that such Liens exist at the time such Person becomes
        a Subsidiary of Company and are not created in anticipation thereof and,
        in any event, do not in the aggregate secure Indebtedness in excess of
        $5,000,000 at any time; and

                (iv)    Liens described on the Closing Date Mortgage Policies;

                (v)     Liens described in Schedule 7.2 annexed hereto; and

                (vi)    Other Liens securing Indebtedness in an aggregate amount
        not to exceed $5,000,000 at any time outstanding.

                B.      Equitable Lien in Favor of Lenders. If Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall create or assume any Lien upon any of its properties or
assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than Liens excepted by
the provisions of subsection 7.2A, it shall make or cause to be made effective
provision whereby the Obligations will be secured by such Lien equally and
ratably with any and all other Indebtedness secured thereby as long as any such
Indebtedness shall be so secured; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
this

                                       103

<PAGE>

covenant shall not be construed as a consent by Requisite Lenders to the
creation or assumption of any such Lien not permitted by the provisions of
subsection 7.2A.

                C.      No Further Negative Pledges. Neither Credit Agreement
Party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall enter into any agreement
prohibiting the creation or assumption of any Lien upon any of its properties or
assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, except with respect to specific
property encumbered to secure payment of particular Indebtedness or to be sold
pursuant to an executed agreement with respect to an Asset Sale.

                D.      No Restrictions on Subsidiary Distributions to Company
or Other Subsidiaries. Each Credit Agreement Party will not, and will not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or
become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the
ability of any such Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make any other
distributions on any of such Subsidiary's Capital Stock owned by Company or any
other Subsidiary of Company, (ii) repay or prepay any Indebtedness owed by such
Subsidiary to Company or any other Subsidiary of Company, (iii) make loans or
advances to Company or any other Subsidiary of Company, or (iv) transfer any of
its property or assets to Company or any other Subsidiary of Company, except (a)
as provided in this Agreement and (b) as may be provided in an agreement with
respect to an Asset Sale.

Section 9.      ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

        9.1     APPOINTMENT.

                A.      Appointment of Administrative Agent. CSFB is hereby
appointed Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.
Each Lender hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to act as its agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Administrative Agent agrees to act upon the express conditions contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as applicable. The provisions of this
Section 9 are solely for the benefit of Administrative Agent and Lenders and
neither Credit Agreement Party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have rights as
a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions thereof. In performing its
functions and duties under this Agreement, Administrative Agent (other than as
provided in subsection 2.1D) shall act solely as an agent of Lenders and does
not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or
relationship of agency or trust with or for either Credit Agreement Party or any
of its Subsidiaries.

                B.      Appointment of Supplemental Collateral Agents. It is the
purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no
violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of
banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in
such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the
enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case Administrative Agent deems
that by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction it may not
exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the
other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or
necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that Administrative Agent
appoint an additional individual or institution as a separate trustee,
co-trustee, collateral agent or collateral co-agent (any such additional
individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a
"Supplemental Collateral Agent" and collectively as "Supplemental Collateral
Agents").

                                       117

<PAGE>

                In the event that Administrative Agent appoints a Supplemental
Collateral Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right,
power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to
Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and
vest in such Supplemental Collateral Agent to the extent, and only to the
extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Collateral Agent to exercise such
rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform
such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation
contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance
thereof by such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall run to and be enforceable by
either Administrative Agent or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, and (ii) the
provisions of this Section 9 and of subsections 10.2 and 10.3 that refer to
Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Collateral
Agent and all references therein to Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be
references to Administrative Agent and/or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as
the context may require.

                Should any instrument in writing from either Credit Agreement
Party or any other Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Collateral Agent
so appointed by Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, each Credit
Agreement Party shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge
and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by Administrative
Agent. In case any Supplemental Collateral Agent, or a successor thereto, shall
die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of such Supplemental Collateral Agent, to the extent
permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised by Administrative Agent until
the appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral Agent.

        9.2     POWERS AND DUTIES; GENERAL IMMUNITY.

                A.      Powers; Duties Specified. Each Lender irrevocably
authorizes Administrative Agent to take such action on such Lender's behalf and
to exercise such powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents as are specifically delegated or granted to Administrative Agent by
the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers, rights and remedies as
are reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent shall have only those
duties and responsibilities that are expressly specified in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. Administrative Agent may exercise such powers, rights
and remedies and perform such duties by or through its agents or employees.
Administrative Agent shall not have, by reason of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or
either Credit Agreement Party; and nothing in this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as
to impose upon Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein or
therein.

                B.      No Responsibility for Certain Matters. No Agent shall be
responsible to any Lender for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness,
validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or
statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral

                                       118

<PAGE>

statements or in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports or
certificates or any other documents furnished or made by such Agent to Lenders
or by or on behalf of any Loan Party to such Agent or any Lender in connection
with the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby or for the
financial condition or business affairs of Company, its Subsidiaries or any
other Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall such Agent be
required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of
the Loan Documents or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the use of
the Letters of Credit or as to the existence or possible existence of any Event
of Default or Potential Event of Default. Anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, Administrative Agent shall not have any
liability arising from confirmations of the amount of outstanding Loans or the
Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts thereof.

                C.      Exculpatory Provisions. No Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable to Lenders for any action taken
or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents
except to the extent caused by such Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. An Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking of
any action (including the failure to take an action) in connection with this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or from the exercise of any power,
discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until
such Agent shall have received instructions in respect thereof from Requisite
Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions
under subsection 10.6) and, upon receipt of such instructions from Requisite
Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be), such Agent shall be
entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise
such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such instructions.
Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and shall be
entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and judgments of
attorneys (who may be attorneys for each Credit Agreement Party and its
Subsidiaries), accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by
it; and (ii) no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against an
Agent as a result of such Agent acting or (where so instructed) refraining from
acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance
with the instructions of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be
required to give such instructions under subsection 10.6).

                D.      Agents Entitled to Act as Lender. The agency hereby
created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or
impose any duties or obligations upon, an Agent in its individual capacity as a
Lender hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Loans and the Letters
of Credit, an Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not performing the duties and
functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" or any
similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include each
Agent in its individual capacity. An Agent and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, acquire equity interests in and generally engage
in any kind of commercial banking, investment banking, trust, financial advisory
or other business with Company or any of its Affiliates as if it were not

                                       119

<PAGE>

performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other
consideration from either Credit Agreement Party and its Subsidiaries for
services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to
account for the same to Lenders.

        9.3     INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION BY LENDERS; NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR
                APPRAISAL OF CREDITWORTHINESS.

                Each Lender agrees that it has made its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Credit Agreement
Party and its Subsidiaries in connection with the making of the Loans and the
issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder and that it has made and shall continue
to make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Credit Agreement Party
and its Subsidiaries. No Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such investigation or any such
appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the
making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have
any responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any
information provided to Lenders.

        9.4     RIGHT TO INDEMNITY.

                Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally
agrees to indemnify each Agent and its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys, professional advisors and Affiliates to the extent that any such
Person shall not have been reimbursed by either Credit Agreement Party, for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and
disbursements and fees and disbursements of any financial advisor engaged by
Agents) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against an Agent or and other such Persons in
exercising the powers, rights and remedies of an Agent or performing duties of
an Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its
capacity as Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of an Agent resulting solely from such
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any indemnity furnished to an Agent or
any other such Person for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Agent, be
insufficient or become impaired, such Agent may call for additional indemnity
and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such
additional indemnity is furnished.

        9.5     SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND SWING LINE LENDER.

                A.      Successor Administrative Agent. Any Agent may resign at
any time by giving 30 days' prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Company.
Upon any such notice of resignation, Requisite Lenders shall have the right,
upon five Business Days' notice to Borrower, to appoint a successor
Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers,

                                       120

<PAGE>

privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under
this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as an Agent,
the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement.

                B.      Successor Swing Line Lender. Any resignation of
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall also constitute the
resignation of CSFB or its successor as Swing Line Lender, and any successor
Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall, upon its
acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Swing Line Lender for all
purposes hereunder. In such event (i) Borrower shall prepay any outstanding
Swing Line Loans made by the retiring or removed Administrative Agent in its
capacity as Swing Line Lender, (ii) upon such prepayment, the retiring
Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender shall surrender any Swing Line Note
held by it to Borrower for cancellation, and (iii) if so requested by the
successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender in accordance with
subsection 2.1E, Borrower shall issue a new Swing Line Note to the successor
Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender substantially in the form of Exhibit
VI annexed hereto, in the principal amount of the Swing Line Loan Commitment
then in effect and with other appropriate insertions.

        9.6     COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS AND GUARANTIES.

                Each Lender hereby further authorizes Administrative Agent, on
behalf of and for the benefit of Lenders, to enter into each Collateral Document
as secured party and to be the agent for and representative of Lenders under
each Guaranty, and each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of each
Collateral Document and Guaranty; provided that Administrative Agent shall not
(i) enter into or consent to any material amendment, modification, termination
or waiver of any provision contained in any Collateral Document or Guaranty or
(ii) release any Collateral (except as otherwise expressly permitted or required
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the applicable Collateral Document),
in each case without the prior consent of Requisite Lenders (or, if required
pursuant to subsection 10.6, all Lenders); provided further, however, that,
without further written consent or authorization from Lenders, Administrative
Agent may execute any documents or instruments necessary to (a) release any Lien
encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of a sale or other
disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders
have otherwise consented, (b) release any Guarantor from any Guaranty if all of
the Capital Stock of such Guarantor is sold to any Person (other than an
Affiliate of Company) pursuant to a sale or other disposition permitted
hereunder or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise consented or (c)
subordinate the Liens of Administrative Agent, on behalf of Lenders, to any
Liens permitted by subsection 7.2; provided that, in the case of a sale of such
item of Collateral or stock referred to in subdivision (a) or (b), the
requirements of subsection 10.14 are satisfied. Anything contained in any of the
Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, each Credit Agreement Party,
Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby agree that (1) no Lender shall have
any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral under any
Collateral Document or to enforce any Guaranty, it being understood and agreed
that all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents and the
Guaranties may be exercised solely by Administrative Agent for the benefit of
Lenders in accordance with

                                       121

<PAGE>

the terms thereof, and (2) in the event of a foreclosure by Administrative Agent
on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale, Administrative
Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any
such sale and Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of Lenders
(but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities
unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled,
for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase
price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to
use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase
price for any collateral payable by Administrative Agent at such sale.

        9.7     DUTIES OF OTHER AGENTS.

                None of the Lenders identified in this Agreement as a
Co-Arranger, Syndication Agent or a Co-Documentation Agent shall have any right,
power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other
than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing,
none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship
with any Lender.

        9.8     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

                In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other judicial proceeding relative to either Credit Agreement Party or any of
its Subsidiaries, Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of
any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or
otherwise and irrespective of whether Administrative Agent shall have made any
demand on either Credit Agreement Party) shall be entitled and empowered, by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

                (i)     to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of
        principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and any
        other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
        papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have
        the claims of Lenders and Agents (including any claim for the reasonable
        compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Lenders and Agents
        and their agents and counsel and all other amounts due Lenders and
        Agents under subsections 2.3 and 10.2) allowed in such judicial
        proceeding, and

                (ii)    to collect and receive any moneys or other property
        payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to Administrative Agent and, in the event that
Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to
Lenders, to pay to Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Agents and their agents
and counsel, and any other amounts due Agents under subsections 2.3 and 10.2.

                Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize
Administrative Agent to

                                       122

<PAGE>

authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations
or the rights of any Lenders or to authorize Administrative Agent to vote in
respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

Section 10.     MISCELLANEOUS.

        10.1    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS IN LOANS
                AND LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                A.      General. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and assigns of Lenders (it
being understood that Lenders' rights of assignment are subject to the further
provisions of this subsection 10.1). None of Credit Agreement Parties' rights or
obligations hereunder nor any interest therein may be assigned or delegated by
either Credit Agreement Party without the prior written consent of all Lenders
(and any attempted assignment or transfer by either Credit Agreement Party
without such consent shall be null and void). No sale, assignment or transfer or
participation of any Letter of Credit or any participation therein may be made
separately from a sale, assignment, transfer or participation of a corresponding
interest in the Revolving Loan Commitment and the Revolving Loans of the
Revolving Lender effecting such sale, assignment, transfer or participation.
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, except as provided in
subsection 2.1A(iii) and subsection 10.5, the Swing Line Loan Commitment and the
Swing Line Loans of Swing Line Lender may not be sold, assigned or transferred
as described below to any Person other than a successor Administrative Agent and
Swing Line Lender to the extent contemplated by subsection 9.5. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
Affiliates of each of Administrative Agent and Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                B.      Assignments.

                (i)     Amounts and Terms of Assignments. Any Lender may assign
        to one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of its rights and
        obligations under this Agreement; provided that (a) except (1) in the
        case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
        Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement or (2) in the case
        of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved
        Fund of a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan Exposure or
        Term Loan Exposure, as the case may be, of the assigning Lender and the
        assignee subject to each such assignment shall not be less than
        $1,000,000, in the case of any assignment of a Revolving Loan, or
        $1,000,000, in the case of any assignment of a Term Loan, unless
        Administrative Agent otherwise consents each such consent not to be
        unreasonably withheld or delayed), (b) each partial assignment shall be
        made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
        Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the
        Loan or the Commitment assigned, (c) the parties to each assignment
        shall (i) electronically execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an

        Assignment Agreement via an electronic settlement system acceptable to
        Administrative Agent (which initially shall be ClearPar, LLC) or, (ii)
        manually execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment
        Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (at
        Administrative Agent's discretion) and the Eligible Assignee, if it
        shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to Administrative Agent information
        reasonably requested by Administrative Agent, including such forms,
        certificates or other evidence, if any, with respect to United States
        federal income tax withholding matters and with respect to information
        requested under the Patriot Act as the assignee under such Assignment
        Agreement may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent pursuant to
        subsection 2.7B(iii), and (d) Administrative Agent and, if no Event of
        Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower, shall have consented
        thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided,
        that no consent of Borrower shall be required in the case of any
        assignment of a Term Loan to another Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or
        an Approved Fund of a Lender and no consent of Borrower shall be
        required in connection with any assignment relating to the primary
        allocation or syndication of the Term Loans or Revolving Loans by CSFB
        to Persons that are either organized under the laws of the United States
        or are qualified to do business in one or more states of the United
        States. Upon such execution, delivery and consent, from and after the
        effective date specified in such Assignment Agreement, (y) the assignee
        thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
        obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
        Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender
        hereunder and (z) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
        that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant
        to such Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any
        rights which survive the termination of this Agreement under subsection
        10.9B) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and,
        in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all or the remaining
        portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
        Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; provided that,
        anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary
        notwithstanding, if such Lender is the Issuing Lender with respect to
        any outstanding Letters of Credit such Lender shall continue to have all
        rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters
        of Credit until the cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit
        and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder). The assigning
        Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly
        thereafter as practicable, surrender its Notes, if any, to
        Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon new Notes shall, if
        so requested by the assignee and/or the assigning Lender in accordance
        with subsection 2.1E, be issued to the assignee and to the assigning
        Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit IV, Exhibit V or Exhibit VI
        annexed hereto, as the case may be, with appropriate insertions, to
        reflect the new Commitments and/or outstanding Revolving Loans and/or
        outstanding Term Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee and the
        assigning Lender. Other than as provided in subsection 2.1A(iii) and
        subsection 10.5, any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
        obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
        subsection 10.1B shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
        sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
        accordance with subsection 10.1C.

                (ii)    Acceptance by Administrative Agent; Recordation in
        Register. Upon its receipt of an Assignment Agreement executed by an
        assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
        Assignee, together with the processing and recordation fee referred to
        in subsection 10.1B(i) and any forms, certificates or other evidence
        with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters
        that such assignee may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent
        pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii), Administrative Agent shall, if
        Administrative Agent and Borrower have consented to the assignment
        evidenced thereby (in each case to the extent such consent is required
        pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i)), (a) accept such Assignment Agreement
        by executing a counterpart thereof as provided therein (which acceptance
        shall evidence any required consent of Administrative Agent to such
        assignment), (b) record the information contained therein in the
        Register, and (c) give prompt notice thereof to Borrower. Administrative
        Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to
        and accepted by it as provided in this subsection 10.1B(ii).

                (iii)   Deemed Consent by either Credit Agreement Party. If the
        consent of either Credit Agreement Party to an assignment or to an
        Eligible Assignee is required hereunder (including a consent to an
        assignment which does not meet the minimum assignment thresholds
        specified in subsection 10.1B(i)), such Credit Agreement Party shall be
        deemed to have given its consent five Business Days after the date
        notice thereof has been delivered by the assigning Lender (through
        Administrative Agent) unless such consent is expressly refused by such
        Credit Agreement Party prior to such fifth Business Day.

                (iv)    Special Purpose Funding Vehicles. Notwithstanding
        anything to the contrary contained in this subsection 10.1B, any Lender
        (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (a
        "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting
        Lender to the Administrative Agent, the option to provide to Company all
        or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be
        obligated to make to Company; provided that (i) nothing herein shall
        constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC
        elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or
        any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make
        such Loan. The making of a Term Loan or Revolving Loan by an SPC
        hereunder shall utilize the Term Loan Commitment or Revolving Loan
        Commitment, as applicable, of the Granting Lender to the same extent, as
        if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto
        hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar
        payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall
        remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each
        party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the
        termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year
        and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial
        paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute
        against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any
        bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
        proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In
        addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
        subsection 10.1, any SPC may (i) with notice

                                       125

<PAGE>

        to, but without the prior written consent of, Administrative Agent and
        without paying any processing fee therefore, assign all or a portion of
        its interests in any Loan to the Granting Lender or to any financial
        institutions (consented to by Administrative Agent) providing liquidity
        and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the
        funding or maintenance of any Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential
        basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating
        agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or
        credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This section may not be
        amended without the written consent of each SPC.

                C.      Participations. Any Lender may, without the consent of,
or notice to, either Credit Agreement Party or Administrative Agent, sell
participations to one or more Persons (other than a natural Person or Company or
any of its Affiliates) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement; provided that (i) such Lender's obligations
under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations and (iii) each Credit Agreement Party, Administrative Agent and
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver directly affecting (i) the extension of the
regularly scheduled maturity of any portion of the principal amount of or
interest on any Loan allocated to such participation or (ii) a reduction of the
principal amount of or the rate of interest payable on any Loan allocated to
such participation. Subject to the further provisions of this subsection 10.1C,
each Credit Agreement Party agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of subsections 2.6D and 2.7 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection 10.1B.
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of subsection 10.4 as though it were a Lender, provided such
Participant agrees to be subject to subsection 10.5 as though it were a Lender.
A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
subsections 2.6D or 2.7 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with each Credit Agreement
Party's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld (it
being understood that a participation resulting in immediate additional payments
would be reason to withhold consent). A Participant that would be a Non-US
Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of subsection
2.7 unless Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant
and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of Borrower, to comply with
subsection 2.7B(iii) as though it were a Lender.

                D.      Pledges and Assignments. Any Lender may at any time
pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its Loans, and the
other Obligations owed to such Lender, to secure obligations of such Lender,
including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to
any Federal Reserve Bank; provided that (i) no Lender shall be relieved of any
of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment or pledge and

                                       126

<PAGE>

(ii) in no event shall any assignee or pledgee be considered to be a "Lender" or
be entitled to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action
hereunder. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans,
subject to clauses (i) and (ii) above, such Lender may, without the consent of
Borrower or Administrative Agent, assign or pledge all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement, including the Loans and Notes, if any, or any other
instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender under this Agreement, to any holder
of, trustee for, or any other representative of holders of, obligations owed or
securities issued, by such fund as security for such obligations or securities;
provided that any foreclosure or similar action by such trustee or
representative shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection 10.1.

                E.      Information. Each Lender may furnish any information
concerning Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession of that Lender from
time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
participants), subject to subsection 10.19.

                F.      Agreements of Lenders. Each Lender listed on the
signature pages hereof hereby agrees (i) that it is an Eligible Assignee
described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof; (ii) that it has experience
and expertise in the making of loans or investing in loans such as the Loans;
and (iii) that it will make its Loans for its own account in the ordinary course
of its business and without a view to distribution of such Loans within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities
laws (it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this subsection
10.1, the disposition of such Loans or any interests therein shall at all times
remain within its exclusive control). Each Lender that becomes a party hereto
pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to agree that the agreements
of such Lender contained in Section 2(c) of such Assignment Agreement are
incorporated herein by this reference.

        10.2    EXPENSES.

                Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated, each Credit Agreement Party, jointly and severally, agrees to pay
promptly (i) all reasonable costs and expenses of negotiation, preparation and
execution of the Loan Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other
modifications thereto; (ii) all costs and expenses of furnishing all opinions by

including with respect to confirming compliance with environmental, insurance
and solvency requirements; (iii) all reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements

Loan Party; (iv) all costs and expenses of creating and perfecting Liens in
favor of Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders pursuant to any Collateral

                                       127

<PAGE>

or the Liens created pursuant thereto; (v) all costs and expenses (including the
reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any auditors, accountants or
appraisers and any environmental or other consultants, advisors and agents
employed or retained by Administrative Agent or its counsel) of obtaining and
reviewing any appraisals provided for under subsection 6.9D and any
environmental audits, reports or questionnaires provided for under subsection
4.1K or 6.9B or 6.9C; (vi) all costs and expenses incurred by Administrative
Agent in connection with the custody or preservation of any of the Collateral;

and (ix) all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees (including
allocated costs of internal counsel), fees, costs and expenses of accountants,
advisors and consultants and costs of settlement, incurred by Administrative
Agent and Lenders in enforcing any Obligations of or in collecting any payments
due from any Loan Party hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (including
in connection with the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any
of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Loan Documents) or in connection
with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under
this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to any insolvency or
bankruptcy proceedings.

        10.3    INDEMNITY.

                In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to subsection
10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated,
each Credit Agreement Party, jointly and severally, agrees to defend (subject to
Indemnitees' selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold harmless the Agents
and Lenders (including Issuing Lenders), and the officers, directors, employees,
agents and Affiliates of Administrative Agent and Lenders (collectively called
the "Indemnitees"), from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities (as
hereinafter defined); provided that neither Credit Agreement Party shall not
have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise solely from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as determined by a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

                As used herein, "Indemnified Liabilities" means, collectively,
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages (including natural
resource damages), penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims (including
Environmental Claims), costs (including the costs of any investigation, study,
sampling, testing, abatement, cleanup, removal, remediation or other response
action necessary to remove, remediate, clean up or abate any Hazardous Materials
Activity), expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for Indemnitees in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding
commenced or threatened by any Person, whether or not any such Indemnitee shall
be designated as a party or a potential party thereto, and any fees or expenses
incurred by Indemnitees in enforcing this indemnity), whether direct, indirect
or consequential and whether based on any federal, state or foreign laws,
statutes, rules or regulations (including securities and commercial laws,
statutes, rules or regulations and

                                       128

<PAGE>

Environmental Laws), on common law or equitable cause or on contract or
otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such
Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of (i) this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including Lenders' agreement to make the Loans hereunder or the use or intended
use of the proceeds thereof or the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder or
the use or intended use of any thereof, the failure of an Issuing Lender to
honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission,
whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto
Government Authority) or any enforcement of any of the Loan Documents (including
any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any of the Collateral or
the enforcement of the Guaranties), (ii) the statements contained in the
commitment letter delivered by any Lender to either Credit Agreement Party with
respect thereto, or (iii) any Environmental Claim or any Hazardous Materials
Activity relating to or arising from, directly or indirectly, any past or
present activity, operation, land ownership, or practice of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. To the extent subsection 2.7 and this subsection 10.3 conflict
and the provisions cannot be construed in a manner that could be viewed as
consistent, subsection 2.7 will govern.

                To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay
and hold harmless set forth in this subsection 10.3 may be unenforceable in
whole or in part because they are violative of any law or public policy, each
Credit Agreement Party shall contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted
to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

        10.4    SET-OFF; SECURITY INTEREST IN DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS.

                In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default each Lender is hereby authorized by each
Credit Agreement Party at any time or from time to time, without notice to
either Credit Agreement Party or to any other Person, any such notice being
hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, including
Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured,
but not including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or
owing by that Lender or any Affiliate of that Lender to or for the credit or the
account of any Loan Party against and on account of the Obligations of any Loan
Party to that Lender (or any Affiliate of that Lender) or to any other Lender
(or any Affiliate of any other Lender) under this Agreement, the Letters of
Credit and participations therein and the other Loan Documents, including all
claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations therein or any other Loan
Document, irrespective of whether or not (i) that Lender shall have made any
demand hereunder or (ii) the principal of or the interest on the Loans or any
amounts in respect of the Letters of Credit or any other amounts due hereunder
shall have become due and payable pursuant to Section 8 and although said
obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured.
Each Credit Agreement Party hereby further grants to Administrative Agent and
each Lender a security interest in all deposits and accounts maintained with
Administrative Agent or such Lender as security for the Obligations.

        10.5    RATABLE SHARING.

                                       129

<PAGE>

                Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall,
whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made
and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), by realization upon
security, through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan
Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash
collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a
proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in
respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to that
Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "Aggregate
Amounts Due" to such Lender) that is greater than the proportion received by any
other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then
the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify
Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the receipt of such payment and
(ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase assignments (which it shall be
deemed to have purchased from each seller of an assignment simultaneously upon
the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment) of the Aggregate
Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of Aggregate
Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate
Amounts Due to them; provided that if all or part of such proportionately
greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from
such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party or
otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for
such assignments shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each Credit Agreement Party
expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any purchaser of
an assignment so purchased may exercise any and all rights of a Lender as to
such assignment as fully as if that Lender had complied with the provisions of
subsection 10.1B with respect to such assignment. In order to further evidence
such assignment (and without prejudice to the effectiveness of the assignment
provisions set forth above), each purchasing Lender and each selling Lender
agree to enter into an Assignment Agreement at the request of a selling Lender
or a purchasing Lender, as the case may be, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to each such Lender.

        10.6    AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.

                No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or of the Notes, and no consent to any departure by
either Credit Agreement Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective without
the written concurrence of Requisite Lenders; provided that no such amendment,
modification, termination, waiver or consent shall, without the consent of (a)

of Requisite Lenders) (1) reduce the principal amount of any Loan, (2) increase
the maximum aggregate amount of Letters of Credit, (3) postpone the scheduled
final maturity date of any Loan, (4) postpone the date of any scheduled

hereunder (excluding any change in the manner in which any financial ratio used
in determining any interest rate or fee is calculated that would result in a
reduction of any such rate or fee), (7) reduce the amount or

                                       130

(8) extend the expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving Loan
Commitment Termination Date or (9) change in any manner the obligations of
Revolving Lenders relating to the purchase of participations in Letters of
Credit; (b) each Lender, (1) change in any manner the definition of "Class" or
the definition of "Pro Rata Share" or the definition of "Requisite Class
Lenders" or the definition of "Requisite Lenders" (except for any changes
resulting solely from an increase in Commitments approved by Requisite Lenders),
(2) change in any manner any provision of this Agreement that, by its terms,

Foreign Guaranty, respectively, in each case other than in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents, or (5) change in any manner or waive the provisions
contained in subsection 8.1 or this subsection 10.6. In addition, (i) any
amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any of the provisions
contained in Section 4 shall be effective only if evidenced by a writing signed
by or on behalf of Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders and, if affecting
subsection 4.3, Issuing Lenders, (ii) no amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of any Note shall be effective without the written
concurrence of the Lender which is the holder of that Note, (iii) no amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of any provision of subsection 2.1A(iii) or
of any other provision of this Agreement relating to the Swing Line Loan
Commitment or the Swing Line Loans shall be effective without the written

or waiver of any provision of Section 3 shall be effective without the written

modification, termination or waiver of any provision of Section 9 or of any
other provision of this Agreement which, by its terms, expressly requires the

termination or waiver of any provision of subsection 2.4 that has the effect of
changing any voluntary or mandatory prepayments or Commitment reductions
applicable to a Class in a manner that disproportionately disadvantages such
Class relative to any other Class shall be effective without the written
concurrence of Requisite Class Lenders of such affected Class (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment, modification, termination or waiver of
any such provision which only postpones or reduces any voluntary or mandatory
prepayment or Commitment reduction from those set forth in subsection 2.4 with
respect to one Class but not any other Class shall be deemed to
disproportionately disadvantage such one Class but not to disproportionately
disadvantage any such other Class for purposes of this clause (vi)) and (vii) no
Commitment of a Lender shall be increased without the consent of such Lender (it
being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent, covenants, Events of
Default or Potential Events of Default or of a mandatory prepayment or
Commitment reduction shall not constitute an increase in the Commitment of any
Lender and that an increase in the available portion of any Commitment of any
Lender shall not constitute an increase in the Commitment of such Lender).
Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence
of any Lender,

                                       131

<PAGE>

execute amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of that Lender.
Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on either
Credit Agreement Party in any case shall entitle either Credit Agreement Party
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any
amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance
with this subsection 10.6 shall be binding upon each Lender at the time
outstanding, each future Lender and, if signed by either Credit Agreement Party,
on such Credit Agreement Party.

        10.7    INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS.

                All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so
that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such
covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would
otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the
occurrence of an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default if such action
is taken or condition exists.

        10.8    NOTICES; EFFECTIVENESS OF SIGNATURES.

                Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice or
other communication herein required or permitted to be given shall be in writing
and may be personally served, or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail or
courier service and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person
or by courier service, upon receipt of telefacsimile in complete and legible
form, or three Business Days after depositing it in the United States mail with
postage prepaid and properly addressed; provided that notices to Administrative
Agent, Swing Line Lender and any Issuing Lender shall not be effective until
received. For the purposes hereof, the address of each party hereto shall be as
set forth under such party's name on the signature pages hereof or (i) as to
Credit Agreement Parties and Administrative Agent, such other address as shall
be designated by such Person in a written notice delivered to the other parties
hereto and (ii) as to each other party, such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice delivered to Administrative Agent.
Electronic mail and Internet and intranet websites may be used to distribute
routine communications, such as financial statements and other information as
provided in subsection 6.01; provided, however, that no signature with respect
to any notice, request, agreement, waiver, amendment or other document or any
notice that is intended to have binding effect may be sent by electronic mail.

                Loan Documents and notices under the Loan Documents may be
transmitted and/or signed by telefacsimile. The effectiveness of any such
documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable law, have the same force
and effect as an original copy with manual signatures and shall be binding on
all Loan Parties, Agents and Lenders. Administrative Agent may also require that
any such documents and signature be confirmed by a manually-signed copy thereof;
provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver any such
manually-signed copy shall not affect the effectiveness of any facsimile
document or signature.

        10.9    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS.

                                       132

<PAGE>

                A.      All representations, warranties and agreements made
herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making
of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit hereunder.

                B.      Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by
law to the contrary, the agreements of the Borrower set forth in subsections
2.6D and 2.7 and the agreements of each Credit Agreement Party set forth in
subsections 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.17 and 10.18 and the agreements of Lenders set
forth in subsections 9.2C, 9.4, 10.5 and 10.18 shall survive the payment of the
Loans, the cancellation or expiration of the Letters of Credit and the
reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and the termination of this
Agreement.

        10.10   FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE

                No failure or delay on the part of an Agent or any Lender in the
exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a
waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

        10.11   MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.

                Neither any Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation
to marshal any assets in favor of either Credit Agreement Party or any other
party or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent
that either Credit Agreement Party makes a payment or payments to Administrative
Agent or Lenders (or to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders), or
Agents or Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights of
setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or
setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal
law, common law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery,
the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all
Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been
made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

        10.12   SEVERABILITY.

                In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement or
the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or
obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

        10.13   OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; INDEPENDENT NATURE OF LENDERS' RIGHTS;
                DAMAGE WAIVER.

                                       133

<PAGE>

                The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender
shall be responsible for the obligations or Commitments of any other Lender
hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and no action
taken by Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute
Lenders, or Lenders and either Credit Agreement Party, as a partnership, an
association, a Joint Venture or any other kind of entity. The amounts payable at
any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and independent debt, and
each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of
this Agreement and it shall not be necessary for any other Lender to be joined
as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

                To the extent permitted by law, each Credit Agreement Party
shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with or
as a result of this Agreement (including, without limitation, subsection 2.1C
hereof), any other Loan Document, any transaction contemplated by the Loan
Documents, any Loan or the use of proceeds thereof.

        10.14   RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST OR GUARANTY.

                Upon the proposed sale or other disposition of any Collateral
that is permitted by this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise
consented, or the sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of a
Subsidiary Guarantor or a Foreign Guarantor to any Person (other than an
Affiliate of Company) permitted by this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders
have otherwise consented, for which a Loan Party desires to obtain a security
interest release or a release of the Subsidiary Guaranty or any Foreign Guaranty
from Administrative Agent, such Loan Party shall deliver an Officer's
Certificate (i) stating that the Collateral or the Capital Stock subject to such
disposition is being sold or otherwise disposed of in compliance with the terms
hereof and (ii) specifying the Collateral or Capital Stock being sold or
otherwise disposed of in the proposed transaction. Upon the receipt of such
Officer's Certificate, Administrative Agent shall, at such Loan Party's expense,
so long as Administrative Agent (a) has no reason to believe that the facts
stated in such Officer's Certificate are not true and correct and (b), if the
sale or other disposition of such item of Collateral or Capital Stock
constitutes an Asset Sale, shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that
arrangements satisfactory to it have been made for delivery of the Net Asset
Sale Proceeds if and as required by subsection 2.4, execute and deliver such
releases of its security interest in such Collateral or such Subsidiary Guaranty
or such Foreign Guaranty, as may be reasonably requested by such Loan Party.

        10.15   APPLICABLE LAW.

                THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTION
5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK), WITHOUT REGARD
TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD REQUIRE APPLICATION OF ANOTHER LAW.

        10.16   CONSTRUCTION OF AGREEMENT; NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP.

                Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) it has been
represented by counsel in the negotiation and documentation of the terms of this
Agreement, (ii) it has had full and fair opportunity to review and revise the
terms of this Agreement, (iii) this Agreement has been drafted jointly by all of
the parties hereto, and (iv) neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender or
other Agent has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to either Credit
Agreement Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between Administrative Agent, the
other Agents and Lenders, on one hand, and either Credit Agreement Party, on the
other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and
creditor. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that
the terms of this Agreement shall not be construed against or in favor of
another party.

        10.17   CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS.

                ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST EITHER CREDIT AGREEMENT
PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT,
OR ANY OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER, MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE, COUNTY AND CITY OF NEW YORK. BY EXECUTING
AND DELIVERING THIS AGREEMENT, EACH CREDIT AGREEMENT PARTY, FOR ITSELF AND IN
CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY

                (i)     ACCEPTS GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY THE NONEXCLUSIVE
        JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS;

                (ii)    WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS;

                (iii)   AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY SUCH
        PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED
        MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO SUCH CREDIT AGREEMENT PARTY AT ITS
        ADDRESS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSECTION 10.8;

                (iv)    AGREES THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (III) ABOVE IS
        SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THE SUCH CREDIT
        AGREEMENT PARTY IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE
        CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT;

                (v)     AGREES THAT LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN
        ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST SUCH
        CREDIT AGREEMENT PARTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION; AND

                                       135

<PAGE>

                (vi)    AGREES THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION 10.17
        RELATING TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE SHALL BE BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE TO
        THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW
        SECTION 5-1402 OR OTHERWISE.

        10.18   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

                EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE ITS
RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY DEALINGS
BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LOAN TRANSACTION OR THE
LENDER/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. The scope of this waiver
is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in
any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction, including
contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other common law and
statutory claims. Each party hereto acknowledges that this waiver is a material
inducement to enter into a business relationship, that each has already relied
on this waiver in entering into this Agreement, and that each will continue to
rely on this waiver in their related future dealings. Each party hereto further
warrants and represents that it has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel
and that it knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following
consultation with legal counsel. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY
NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN
WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SUBSECTION 10.18 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS,
RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE LOANS
MADE HEREUNDER. In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a
written consent to a trial by the court.

        10.19   CONFIDENTIALITY.

                Each Lender shall hold all non-public information obtained
pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement that has been identified in
writing as confidential by Borrower in accordance with such Lender's customary
procedures for handling confidential information of this nature, it being
understood and agreed by each Credit Agreement Party that in any event a Lender
may make disclosures (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors
(it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed to keep
such information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any Government
Authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement,
(e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit,
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights
hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the
same as those of this subsection 10.19, to (i) any Eligible Assignee

                                       136

<PAGE>

of or participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or
indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such
contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor)
to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of either Credit
Agreement Party, (g) with the consent of either Credit Agreement Party, (h) to
the extent such information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this subsection 10.19 or (ii) becomes available to
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than either Credit Agreement Party or (i) to the National Association of

communications from counsel to an Agent and no information that is or is
designated as privileged or as attorney work product may be disclosed to any
Person unless such Person is a Lender or a participant hereunder; provided that,
unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender
shall notify Borrower of any request by any Government Authority or
representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with any
examination of the financial condition of such Lender by such Government
Authority) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure
of such information; and provided, further that in no event shall any Lender be
obligated or required to return any materials furnished by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. In addition, Administrative Agent and Lenders may disclose the
existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data
collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service
providers to Administrative Agent and Lenders.

supplements hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such
