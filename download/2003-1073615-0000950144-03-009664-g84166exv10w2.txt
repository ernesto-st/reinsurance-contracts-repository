                                 for the purposes of the actuarial certification?  at this time.
                                 Is it the general definition as described on
                                 page 99 of the RFP or is it the CMS definition

annualized). Utilization is shown for each risk group and age/sex category by
county, GSA, and statewide. All of the column totals, GSA information, and
statewide information have been weighted. These utilization reports are for
prospective enrollment only.

Before utilizing this information, the bidder should review Section D, Service
Matrix/ Selection Criteria. The Service Matrix defines and describes the
selection criteria used for each of the service categories shown in this

The utilization information presented in this section represents historical
annual utilization per 1,000 members. With the exception of the average length
of stay information, the utilization statistics have been calculated by dividing
the total number of the units/encounters counted, by the total number of member
months in the rate code and age/sex categories, and multiplying the result by
12,000 (1,000 members for 12 months). The member months used in the denominator
of the calculation can be found in Section I, Acute Capitated Member Months

schedule if the provider is subcapitated) , by the total number of encounters.

COST PMPM

The first set of reports in this section present cost PMPM information by county
and GSA. These detailed reports are sorted by contract year and then service
categories within each year. The second set of reports in this section present
statewide costs PMPM. The statewide reports are sorted by service category first
and then contract year under each service category.

                  provide services in a timely manner, 5) the failure of the
                  Contractor to comply with the timeframes for dispositions of
                  grievances and appeals and 6) the denial of a rural enrollee's
                  request to obtain services outside the Contractor's network

                  informs the enrollee of the limited time available in cases
                  involving expedited resolution.

         -        That for appeals, the Contractor provides the enrollee and his
                  representative the opportunity before and during the appeals
                  process to examine the enrollee's case file including medical
                  records and other documents considered during the appeals
                  process.

         -        That if the Contractor denies a request for expedited
                  resolution, it must make reasonable efforts to give the
                  enrollee prompt oral notice and follow-up within two calendar
                  days with a written notice of the denial of expedited
                  resolution.

         -        That the Contractor shall ensure that individuals who make
                  decisions regarding grievance and appeals are individuals not
                  involved in any previous level of review or decision making
                  and that individuals who make decisions regarding: 1) appeals
                  of denials based on lack of medical necessity, 2) a grievance
                  regarding denial of expedited resolution of an appeal or 3)

                  condition or disease.

         -        That the Contractor shall provide written notice of the
                  disposition of each appeal which must contain: 1) the results
                  of the resolution process and the date it was completed, 2)
                  for appeals not resolved wholly in favor of enrollees: a) the
                  enrollee's right to request a State fair hearing and how to do
                  so, b) the right to receive benefits pending the hearing and
                  how to request continuation of benefits and c) information
                  explaining that the enrollee may be held liable for the cost
                  of benefits if the hearing decision upholds the Contractor.

                  for hearing is filed, the Contractor must ensure that all
                  supporting documentation is received by the AHCCCSA, Office of

                  GENERAL GUIDANCE ON BIDDING CAPITATION RATES
                  WITH THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT CARVED OUT

The following information is provided as guidance to bidders for submitting a
capitation rate proposal with the prescription drug benefit carved out. AHCCCS
is currently in the process of hiring a consultant to perform an analysis of the
potential carve out. Part of that analysis will include a recommendation for the
design that will be used in the event that the benefit is carved out. AHCCCS
anticipates that the analysis will be completed in the Summer of 2003.
Therefore, the following should be considered a guide for preparing the
capitation rate bid submissions; however, it is subject to change. In any event
this information will help ensure that bidders are all using most of the same
assumptions when developing their capitation rate proposals for the carve out
option.

     -   Due to recent guidance from CMS, AHCCCS fully expects that there will
         be a closed formulary. AHCCCS will solicit Contractor input in
         developing the formulary as well as input from other required parties
         as defined in the federal Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.

     -   AHCCCS in conjunction with its Contractors will develop statewide prior
         authorization criteria for the Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) that is
         awarded a contract. It is anticipated that the prior authorization
         requirements will be as effective as those currently used at the health
         plans.

     -   In the Pharmacy RFP, AHCCCS will incorporate the requirement for the
         PBM to send real time data to the Contractors. This process should be
         similar to AHCCCS' current Contractor's data exchange protocols and
         requirements with their PBM's.

     -   The real time access to data should ensure that the Contractor's will
         continue to receive real time data for use in utilization management,
         disease management programs, identification of drug-seeking members,
         care coordination, case management, and provider profiling, etc.

     -   AHCCCS believes that there is a potential for a prescription drug carve
         out to have an impact on the utilization of other services. This impact
         will vary by plan and type of program (acute versus long term care).
         Each bidder should factor its unique integration of pharmacy management
         into their operations when determining secondary impacts. AHCCCS
         expects that each plan will have a different estimate. They should
         factor that into their capitation rate bidding.

     -   The bidder should also consider the impact the prescription drug carve
         out will have to their administrative costs. For example, if the PBM
         does all prior authorizations, how would that impact the Contractor
         staffing? Conversely, because the plans will continue to perform
         utilization management based upon PBM data, there may be no staffing
         impact.

Please refer to the Question and Answer document that will be issued in the 2nd
RFP Amendment for further information on the potential prescription drug carve
out.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

INCENTIVE FUND: AHCCCSA may retain a specified percentage of capitation
reimbursement in order to distribute to Contractors based on their performance
measure outcomes. The incentive fund will not be implemented in CYE '04 and
contractors will be notified at least 60 days prior to implementation in a
future contract year.

58. REINSURANCE

Reinsurance is a stop-loss program provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the
partial reimbursement of covered services, as described below, for a member with
an acute medical condition beyond an annual deductible level. AHCCCSA
"self-insures" the reinsurance program through a deduction to capitation rates
that is intended to be budget neutral. Refer to the AHCCCSA Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual for further details on the Reinsurance Program.

INPATIENT REINSURANCE

Inpatient reinsurance covers partial reimbursement of covered inpatient facility
medical services. See the table below for applicable deductible levels and
coinsurance percentages. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA
will reimburse the Contractor for covered inpatient services incurred above the
deductible. The deductible is the responsibility of the Contractor. Per diem
rates paid for nursing facility services provided within 30 days of an acute
hospital stay, including room and board, provided in lieu of hospitalization for
up to 90 days in any contract year shall be eligible for reinsurance coverage.

The following table represents deductible and coinsurance levels for CYE '04:

*applies to all members except for Title XIX Waiver Group members

a) PROSPECTIVE REINSURANCE: This coverage applies to prospective enrollment
periods. The deductible level is based on the Contractor's statewide AHCCCS
acute care enrollment (not including SOBRA Family Planning Extension services)
as of October 1st each contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown
in the table above. AHCCCSA will adjust the Contractor's deductible level at the
beginning of a contract year if the Contractor's enrollment changes to the next
enrollment level. A Contractor at the $35,000 or $50,000 deductible level may
elect a lower deductible prior to the beginning of a new contract year. These
deductible levels are subject to change by AHCCCSA during the term of this
contract. Any change will have a corresponding impact on capitation rates.

b) PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE REINSURANCE: Effective October 1, 2003, AHCCCSA will no
longer cover PPC inpatient expenses under the reinsurance program for any
members except Title XIX Waiver Group members. See section c) below for
additional information.

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

CAPACITY ANALYSIS/PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT

         8.       Provide a copy of the Offeror's Network Development and
                  Management Plan. (No page limit)
                  Reference: Section D, Paragraph 27, Network Development
                  (Provider Network Development and Management Plan)

         9.       Provide a synopsis of the Offerer's Disaster Recovery Plan as
                  it relates to the provider network. (No page limit)
                  Reference: Section D, Paragraph 73, Business Continuity Plan

III.  CAPITATION

Capitation is a fixed (per member) monthly payment to contractors for the
provision of covered services to members. It is an actuarially sound amount to
cover expected utilization and costs for the individual risk groups in a
risk-sharing managed care environment. The Offeror must demonstrate that the
capitation rates proposed are actuarially sound. In general terms, this means
that the Offeror who is awarded a contract should be able to keep utilization at
or near its proposed levels and that it will be able to contract for unit costs
that average at or near the amounts shown on the Capitation Rates Calculation
Sheet (CRCS). This requirement also applies to bids submitted in best and final
offer rounds.

Prior Period Coverage (PPC) and HIV/AIDS Supplement rates will be set by AHCCCS'
actuaries and not bid by the Contractor. Due to the lack of complete historical
data, the Title XIX Waiver Group and HIFA Parents' rates will also be set by
AHCCCS' actuaries, rather than bid by the Contractor. See Section D, Paragraph
53, Compensation, for information regarding risk sharing for the Title XIX
Waiver Group and PPC time period. All other rate codes, including the Delivery
Supplemental Payment, will be subject to competitive bidding.

To facilitate the preparation of its capitation proposals, AHCCCSA will provide
each Offeror with a Data Supplement. This data source should not be used as the
sole source of information in making decisions concerning the capitation
proposal. Each Offeror is solely responsible for research, preparation and
documentation of its capitation proposal.

REQUIRED SUBMISSION:   CAPITATION

         10.      The Offeror must submit its capitation proposal using the
                  AHCCCSA bid web site. Instructions for accessing and using the
                  web site will be issued by March 1, 2003. The Offeror must
                  have an actuary who is a member of the American Academy of
                  Actuaries certify that the bid submission is actuarially
                  sound. This certification must be done with subsequent
                  submissions in Best and Final Offer rounds (if applicable).
                  The Offeror must also submit hard copy print outs of the web
                  site CRCS. Refer to Section B and Attachment E for more
                  details.

                  The Offeror must prepare and submit its capitation proposal
                  assuming a $20,000 deductible level for regular reinsurance,
                  for all rate codes, in all counties. AHCCCSA will provide a
                  table of per member per month reinsurance adjustments to be
                  made to capitation rates for those Contractors whose actual
                  deductible level exceeds $20,000.

                  Capitation rates shall be submitted two ways: first, assuming
                  all medical services are included in the capitation rates, and
                  second, assuming that prescription drugs will be carved out of
                  the capitation rates. Prescription drugs are defined as "FDA
                  approved legend or over the counter (OTC) products provided
                  upon receipt of a valid prescription order and dispensed by a
                  pharmacist in an outpatient setting." When bidding with
                  prescription drugs carved out, please factor the impact to the
                  other medical service and administrative categories. AHCCCSA
                  anticipates that in the event that prescription drugs are
                  carved

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

2ND NEWBORN SCREEN (PKU) TESTING

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2002, THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES ADHS)
REQUIRES THAT A 2ND NEWBORN SCREEN TEST BE DONE ON ALL ARIZONA NEWBORNS. THE
CODE FOR THE TESTING IS S3620. THE COST OF THE TEST IS $20. IN ADDITION TO THE
COST OF THE TEST, THERE ARE ASSOCIATED HANDLING FEES THAT CONTRACTORS ARE
REQUIRED TO PAY TO THE PROVIDERS COLLECTING THE TEST. THE AHCCCS FEE FOR SERVICE
SCHEDULE FOR HANDLING FEES IS $4.25 FOR TESTS PERFORMED IN PHYSICIANS' OFFICES,
AND $10.00 FOR TESTS PERFORMED IN

<PAGE>

CONTRACTED LABORATORY FACILITIES. THESE SERVICES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE DATA
SUPPLEMENT DUE TO LAG IN CAPTURING ENCOUNTER DATA.

CIRCUMCISIONS

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2002 ELECTIVE CIRCUMCISIONS ARE NO LONGER A COVERED
SERVICE. CIRCUMCISION SERVICES HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE ENCOUNTER UTILIZATION
REPORTS.

HOSPITAL PILOT PROGRAM

THE HOSPITAL PILOT PROGRAM IN MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTIES WAS TERMINATED FOR CYE
'01 AND REINSTATED FOR CYE '02 AND CYE '03. THE PILOT PROGRAM STATES THAT IF A
HEALTH PLAN IN MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTIES IS UNABLE TO CONTRACT WITH A HOSPITAL
FOR INPATIENT SERVICES, THEN THE HEALTH PLAN REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS 95% OF THE
AHCCCS TIER PER DIEMS. HEALTH PLAN COST INFORMATION FOR INPATIENT STAYS IN
MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTIES WILL REFLECT THE TERMINATION OF THE PILOT PROGRAM FOR
CYE '01. EVEN THOUGH THE PROGRAM IS SCHEDULED TO TERMINATED CYE '04, BIDDERS
SHOULD ASSUME THAT THE PILOT PROGRAM WILL BE REINSTATED THROUGH LEGISLATION.

TITLE XIX WAIVER GROUP

EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2001, AHCCCS RECEIVED A WAIVER FROM CMS THAT CONVERTED THE
MEDICALLY NEEDY/MEDICALLY INDIGENT (MNMI) POPULATION FROM A STATE FUNDED ONLY
POPULATION TO A TITLE XIX FUNDED POPULATION. THIS GROUP WAS RENAMED THE TITLE
XIX WAIVER GROUP (TWG).

THIS POPULATION HAS TWO COMPONENTS. FIRST, EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, THE
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA CHANGED TO INCREASE THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL) FOR
DETERMINING TITLE XIX ELIGIBILITY TO INCOMES AT OR BELOW 100% OF THE FPL
(NON-MED'S) FROM 40% OF THE FPL. THE SECOND GROUP OF MEMBERS IS THE MEDICAL
EXPENSE DEDUCTION (MED). THESE MEMBERS HAVE INCOMES ABOVE 100% OF THE FPL, BUT
INCUR SUFFICIENT MEDICAL COSTS THAT CAUSE THEM TO "SPEND DOWN" TO BELOW 40% OF
THE FPL.

DUE TO THE HISTORICAL HIGH PERCENTAGE OF MNMI MEMBERS BECOMING ELIGIBLE WHILE
HOSPITALIZED, AHCCCSA CREATED A HOSPITALIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT AS A METHOD OF
RISK ADJUSTMENT FOR THIS POPULATION. AFTER MONITORING THE ACTUAL PERCENTAGES OF
MEMBERS WHO BECOME ELIGIBLE WHILE HOSPITALIZED, EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2003,
AHCCCSA WILL NO LONGER PAY A HOSPITALIZED SUPPLEMENT FOR THE NON-MED PORTION OF
THE TITLE XIX WAIVER GROUP.

<PAGE>

DUE TO UNCERTAINLY OF THE RISK OF THIS POPULATION, AHCCCSA WILL CONTINUE TO SET
THE CAPITATION RATES AND RECONCILE THE MEDICAL EXPENDITURES FOR CYE '04. THE
RECONCILIATION WILL INCLUDE A 2% RISK BAND. REFER TO THE TITLE XIX WAIVER GROUP
RECONCILIATION POLICY IN THE BIDDER'S LIBRARY FOR MORE DETAILS.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE

FOR CYE '03, AHCCCS PLACED HEALTH PLANS AT FULL RISK FOR MEDICAL SERVICE
EXPENDITURES INCURRED DURING THE PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE (PPC) TIME PERIOD. THERE
WILL NOT BE A RECONCILIATION FOR CYE '03 PPC EXPENDITURES.

EFFECTIVE CYE '04, AHCCCS WILL SET THE CAPITATION RATES FOR THE PPC TIME PERIOD
AND RECONCILE PPC MEDICAL EXPENSES TO SERVICE REVENUES PER THE PPC
RECONCILIATION POLICY FOUND IN THE BIDDER'S LIBRARY. THE RECONCILIATION WILL
INCLUDE A 2% RISK BAND.

BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT PROGRAM

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, AHCCCS IMPLEMENTED THE BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER
TREATMENT PROGRAM. FOR CYE '02, ALL MEDICAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
POPULATION WERE PAID THROUGH THE AHCCCS REINSURANCE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, HEALTH
PLANS WERE PAID THE TANF 14-44F CAPITATION RATE ON A MONTHLY BASIS. FOR YEARS
BEGINNING WITH CYE '04, THE PLANS WILL BE AT FULL RISK FOR THIS POPULATION.
AHCCCSA WILL NO LONGER PAY FOR MEDICAL SERVICES THROUGH REINSURANCE. THE
ENCOUNTER UTILIZATION REPORTS FOR CYE '02 INCLUDE THE RATE CODES AND MEDICAL
EXPERIENCE FOR THE BCCTP POPULATION IN THE TANF 14-44F AND TANF 45+ RISK GROUPS.

HIFA PARENTS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, AHCCCSA IMPLEMENTED ITS HIFA WAIVER WITH CMS THAT
PERMITS USING EXCESS TITLE XXI FUNDS TO THE COVER THE PARENTS OF KIDSCARE AND
SOBRA CHILDREN ELIGIBLE MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE. THIS PROGRAM HAS
A LIMIT ON THE ENROLLMENT DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF EXCESS FUNDING. BECAUSE
THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO ENCOUNTERS FOR THIS POPULATION, AHCCCSA WILL SET THE
RATES FOR CYE '04.

KIDSCARE/TANF (1931) COMBINING

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2002, AHCCCSA BLENDED THE COST AND UTILIZATION EXPERIENCE
OF THE HEALTH PLANS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING ONE CAPITATION RATE FOR TANF
(1931)/ SOBRA/ AND KIDSCARE MEMBERS. THE

<PAGE>

ENCOUNTER UTILIZATION REPORTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO INCLUDE THE KIDSCARE RATE
CODES IN THE TANF/SOBRA RISK GROUPS.

POPULATION GROWTH

WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION 204 IN OCTOBER 2001 THAT INCREASED THE MEDICAID
ELIGIBILITY LEVEL TO 100% OF THE FPL, AHCCCS POPULATION HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY.
IN ADDITION TO PROPOSITION 204, AHCCCS' MEMBERSHIP HAS GROWN DUE TO THE DOWNTURN
IN THE ECONOMY AS WELL AS NEW EFFICIENCIES IN THE ELIGIBILITY PROCESS. THIS
GROWTH IS REPRESENTED IN MEMBER MONTH AND ENROLLMENT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN
THIS SUPPLEMENT.

<PAGE>

                        REINSURANCE PAYMENTS FOR CYE `01

This section presents the statewide reinsurance paid per member per month to
health plans for the period October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2001. When
estimating reinsurance, the bidder should consider all changes to the
reinsurance program effective October 1, 2003. The bidder should also consider
changes in rates and utilization from year to year.

See Section B, Program Changes, for reinsurance deductible level changes
effective October 1, 2003. The bidder should note that all bids should be
prepared assuming the deductible levels for statewide enrollment of 0-35,000
members ($20,000). If the health plan's statewide enrollment exceeds 35,000
members, their capitation rates will be adjusted upwards where applicable, to
offset the higher deductible levels.

                  that the capitation rates submitted by the Offeror are
                  actuarially sound by an actuary who is a member of the
                  American Academy of Actuaries.

         3.       The Capitation Rate Calculation Sheets (CRCS) will be

SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

1.       TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW

The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/03 through 9/30/06, with two
one-year options to renew. All contract renewals shall be through contract
amendment. AHCCCSA shall issue amendments prior to the end date of the contract
when there is an adjustment to capitation rates and/or changes to the scope of
service contained herein. Changes to scope of service include but are not
limited to changes in the enrolled population, changes in covered services,
changes in GSA's

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such
contract will be considered separately renewable. AHCCCSA may renew the
Contractor's contract in one GSA, but not in another. In addition, if the
Contractor has had significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may
result in the capping of the Contractor's enrollment in all GSAs. Further,
AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to renew all currently awarded GSA's, or may
terminate the contract if the Contractor does not agree to renew all currently
awarded GSA's.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to the contract, the provisions of such renewal
will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing by
AHCCCSA, even if the amendment has not been signed by the Contractor, unless
within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that it refuses to
sign the renewal amendment. If the Contractor provides such notification,
AHCCCSA will initiate contract termination proceedings.

CONTRACTOR'S NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO RENEW: If the Contractor chooses not to
renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated
with the transition of its members to a different health plan. If the Contractor
provides AHCCCSA written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at
least 180 days before its expiration, this liability for transition costs may be
waived by AHCCCSA.

CONTRACT TERMINATION: In the event the contract, or any portion thereof, is
terminated for any reason, or expires, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in
the transition of its members to other contractors, and shall abide by standards
and protocols set forth in Paragraph 9, Transition of Members. In addition,
AHCCCSA reserves the right to extend the term of the contract on a
month-to-month basis to assist in any transition of members. The Contractor
shall make provision for continuing all management and administrative services
until the transition of all members is completed and all other requirements of
this contract are satisfied. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing
all reports set forth in this contract and necessary for the transition process
and shall be responsible for the following:

a.       Notification of subcontractors and members.

b.       Payment of all outstanding obligations for medical care rendered to
         members.

c.       Until AHCCCSA is satisfied that the Contractor has paid all such
         obligations, the Contractor shall provide the following reports to
         AHCCCSA:

              (1) A monthly claims aging report by provider/creditor including
                  IBNR amounts;

              (3) Copies of all bank statements received by the Contractor.

d.       Such reports shall be due on the fifth day of each succeeding month for
         the prior month.

e.       In the event of termination or suspension of the contract by AHCCCSA,
         such termination or suspension shall not affect the obligation of the
         Contractor to indemnify AHCCCSA for any claim by any third party
         against the State or AHCCCSA arising from the Contractor's performance
         of this contract and for which the Contractor would otherwise be liable
         under this contract.

f.       Any dispute by the Contractor, with respect to termination or
         suspension of this contract by AHCCCSA, shall be exclusively governed
         by the provisions of Section E, Paragraph 26, Disputes.

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

moves out of the health plan's service areas, changes contractors during the
member's open enrollment/annual enrollment choice period or when approved for a
health plan change through the AHCCCS Health Plan Change Policy. Eligibility for
the various AHCCCS coverage groups is determined by one of the following
agencies:

Social Security
Administration (SSA)       SSA determines eligibility for the Supplemental
                           Security Income (SSI) cash program. SSI cash
                           recipients are automatically eligible for AHCCCS
                           coverage.

Department of Economic
Security (DES)             DES determines eligibility for the families with
                           children under section 1931 of the Social Security
                           Act, pregnant women and children under SOBRA, the
                           Adoption Subsidy Program, Title IV- E foster care
                           children, Young Adult Transitional Insurance Program,
                           the Federal Emergency Services program (FES), HIFA
                           parents of SOBRA eligible children, the Title XIX
                           Waiver Members, and the State Emergency Services
                           (SES) program.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

AHCCCSA                    AHCCCSA determines eligibility for the SSI/Medical
                           Assistance Only groups, including the FES program for
                           this population (aged, disabled, blind), the Arizona
                           Long-Term Care System (ALTCS), the Qualified Medicare
                           Beneficiary program and other Medicare cost sharing
                           programs, BCCTP, the Freedom to Work program, the
                           Title XXI KidsCare program, and HIFA parents of
                           KidsCare children.

AHCCCS acute care members are enrolled with Contractors in accordance with the
rules set forth in R9-22, Article 17, R9-31-306, 307, 309 and 1719.

HEALTH PLAN CHOICE

All AHCCCS members eligible for services covered under this contract have a
choice of available health plans. Information about these health plans will be
given to each applicant during the application process for AHCCCS benefits. If
there is only one health plan available for the applicant's Geographic Service
Area, no choice is offered as long as the health plan offers the member a choice
of PCPs. Members who do not choose prior to AHCCCSA being notified of their
eligibility, are automatically assigned to a health plan based on family
continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm. See Section D, Paragraph 6,
Auto-Assignment Algorithm, for further explanation.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX members include
previously enrolled members who have been disenrolled for less than 90 days.
These members will be automatically enrolled with the same Contractor, if still
available. Members who have less than 30 days of continued eligibility will not
be enrolled with a Contractor, but will be placed on Fee for Service. FES and
SES members are not enrolled with a health plan. Women, who become eligible for
the Family Planning Services Extension Program, will remain assigned to their
current health plan.

The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX member with the Contractor
is the day AHCCCSA takes the enrollment action, generally the day prior to the
date the Contractor receives notification from AHCCCSA via the daily roster.
However, the Contractor is responsible for payment of medically necessary
covered services retroactive to the member's beginning date of eligibility.

KidsCare members must select a health plan prior to being determined eligible
and therefore, will not be auto-assigned. If the HIFA parent does not choose,
they will be enrolled with their child's health plan following the enrollment
rules set forth in R9-31-1719. When a member is transferred from Title XIX to
Title XXI and has not made a health plan choice for Title XXI, the member will
remain with their current health plan and a choice notice will be sent to the
member. The member may then change plans no later than 16 days from the date the
choice notice is sent.

The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member, including HIFA parents,
will be the first day of the month following notification to the health plan,
with few exceptions.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE: AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for the period of
time, prior to the Title XIX member's enrollment, during which a member is
eligible for covered services. The time frame is from the effective date of
eligibility to the day a member is enrolled with the Contractor. The Contractor
receives notification from the Administration of the member's enrollment. The
Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary
covered services provided to members during prior period coverage. This may
include services provided prior to the contract year (See Section D, Paragraph
53, Compensation, for a description of the Contractor's reimbursement from
AHCCCSA for this eligibility time period.)

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

NEWBORNS: Newborns, born to AHCCCS eligible mothers enrolled at the time of the
child's birth, will be enrolled with the mother's contractor, when newborn
notification is received by AHCCCSA. The Contractor is responsible for notifying
AHCCCSA of a child's birth to an enrolled member. Capitation for the newborn
will begin on the date notification is received by AHCCCSA (except for cases of
births during prior period coverage). The effective date of AHCCCS eligibility
will be the newborn's date of birth, and the Contractor is responsible for all
covered services to the newborn whether or not AHCCCSA has received notification
of the child's birth. AHCCCSA is currently available to receive notification
calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Eligible mothers of newborns are sent a
letter advising them of their right to choose a different contractor for their
child; the date of the change will be the date of processing the request from
the mother. If the mother does not request a change, the child will remain with
the mother's contractor.

Newborns of FES mothers are auto-assigned to a contractor and mothers of these
newborns are sent a letter advising them of their right to choose a different
contractor for their child. In the event the FES mother chooses a different
contractor, AHCCCS will recoup all capitation paid to the originally assigned
contractor and the baby will be enrolled retroactive to the date of birth in the
second contractor. The second contractor will receive prior period capitation
from the date of birth to the day before assignment and prospective capitation
from the date of assignment forward. The second contractor will be responsible
for all covered services to the newborn from date of birth.

ENROLLMENT GUARANTEES: Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XIX-eligible
member, the member is guaranteed a minimum of five full months of continuous
enrollment. Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XXI-eligible member,
the member is guaranteed a minimum of 12 full months of continuous enrollment.
Enrollment guarantees do not apply to HIFA parents. The enrollment guarantee is
a one-time benefit. If a member changes from one contractor to another within
the enrollment guarantee period, the remainder of the guarantee period applies
to the new contractor. The enrollment guarantee may not be granted or may be
terminated if the member is incarcerated or, if a minor child is adopted. AHCCCS
Rule R9-22, Article 17 and R9-31, Article 3 describes other reasons for which
the enrollment guarantee may not apply.

NATIVE AMERICANS: Native Americans, on or off-reservation, may choose to receive
services from Indian Health Service (IHS), a PL 93-638 tribal facility or any
available contractor. If a choice is not made within the specified time limit,
Native American Title XIX members living on-reservation will be assigned to IHS.
Native American Title XIX members living off-reservation will be assigned to an
available contractor using AHCCCS' Family Continuity Policy and auto-assignment
algorithm. Native American Title XXI members must make a choice prior to being
determined eligible. Title XXI HIFA parent members' enrollment will follow the
Title XIX enrollment rules. Native Americans may change from IHS to a contractor
or from a contractor to IHS at any time.

4.       ANNUAL ENROLLMENT CHOICE

AHCCCSA conducts an Annual Enrollment Choice (AEC) for members on their annual
anniversary date. AHCCCSA may hold an open enrollment as deemed necessary.
During AEC, members may change contractors subject to the availability of other
contractors within their Geographic Service Area. Members are mailed a printed
enrollment form and other information required by the Balanced Budget Act of
1997 (BBA) 60 days prior to their AEC date and may choose a new contractor by
contacting AHCCCSA to complete the enrollment process. If the member does not
participate in the AEC, no change of contractor will be made (except for
approved changes under the Change of Plan Policy) during the new anniversary
year. This holds true if a contractor's contract is renewed and the member
continues to live in a contractor's service area. The Contractor shall comply
with the AHCCCS, Office of Managed Care Member Transition for Annual Enrollment
Choice, Open Enrollment and Other Plan Changes Policy and the AMPM.

                                                                  Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

5.       OPEN ENROLLMENT

In the event that AHCCCSA does not award a CYE '04 contract to an incumbent
contractor, AHCCCSA will hold an open enrollment for those members enrolled with
the exiting contractor. If those members do not elect to choose a contractor,
they will be auto assigned. In addition to open enrollment, AHCCCSA will make
changes to both annual enrollment choice materials and new enrollee materials
prior to October 1, 2003 to reflect the change in available health plans. The
auto assignment algorithm will be adjusted to exclude auto assignment of new
enrollees to exiting contractors(s). The exact dates for the open enrollment and
other changes described above have not yet been determined, but will be
communicated when they are finalized.

6.       AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not exercise their right to choose and do not have family
continuity, are assigned to a contractor through an auto-assignment algorithm.
The algorithm is a mathematical formula used to distribute members to the
various contractors in a manner that is predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA
goals. The algorithm favors those contractors with lower capitation rates and
higher program scores in the latest contract award. For further details on the
AHCCCS Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G. AHCCCSA may change the
algorithm at any time during the term of the contract in response to
contractor-specific issues (e.g. imposition of an enrollment cap). The
Contractor should consider this in preparing its response to this RFP.
Capitation rates may be adjusted to reflect changes to a contractor's risk due
to changes in the algorithm.

7.       AHCCCS MEMBER IDENTIFICATION CARDS

Contractors are responsible for paying the costs of producing AHCCCS member
identification cards. The Contractor will receive an invoice the month following
the issue date of the identification card.

8.       MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS

To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall take affirmative
action so that members are provided covered services without regard to payer
source, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin, ancestry,
marital status, sexual preference, genetic information, or physical or mental
handicap, except where medically indicated. Contractors must take into account a
member's culture, when addressing members and their concerns, and must take
reasonable steps to encourage subcontractors to do the same. The Contractor must
make interpreters of any language available free of charge for all members to
ensure appropriate delivery of covered services. The Contractor must provide
members with information instructing them about how to access these services.

Examples of prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, the following:

a.       Denying or not providing a member any covered service or access to an
         available facility.

b.       Providing to a member any covered service which is different, or is
         provided in a different manner or at a different time from that
         provided to other members, other public or private patients or the
         public at large, except where medically necessary.

c.       Subjecting a member to segregation or separate treatment in any manner
         related to the receipt of any covered service; restricting a member in
         any way in his or her enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed
         by others receiving any covered service.

d.       The assignment of times or places for the provision of services on the
         basis of the race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, national origin,
         ancestry, marital status, sexual preference, income status, AHCCCS
         membership, or physical or mental handicap of the participants to be
         served.

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

If the Contractor knowingly executes a subcontract with a provider with the
intent of allowing or permitting the subcontractor to implement barriers to care
(i.e. the terms of the subcontract act to discourage the full utilization of
services by some members), the Contractor will be in default of its contract.

If the Contractor identifies a problem involving discrimination by one of its
providers, it shall promptly intervene and implement a corrective action plan.
Failure to take prompt corrective measures may place the Contractor in default
of its contract.

9.       TRANSITION OF MEMBERS

The Contractor shall comply with the AMPM, and the AHCCCS, Office of Managed
Care Member Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice, Open Enrollment and Other
Plan Changes Policy standards for member transitions between health plans or
GSAs, enrollment in or discharge from CRS, to or from an ALTCS Program
Contractor, IHS, a PL 93-638 tribal entity, and upon termination or expiration
of a contract. The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and
procedures, which comply with these policies to address transition of:

a.       Members with significant medical conditions such as a high-risk
         pregnancy or pregnancy within the last 30 days, the need for organ or
         tissue transplantation, chronic illness resulting in hospitalization or
         nursing facility placement, etc.;

b.       Members who are receiving ongoing services such as dialysis, home
         health, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or who are hospitalized
         at the time of transition;

c.       Members who have received prior authorization for services such as
         scheduled surgeries, out-of-area specialty services, nursing home
         admission;

d.       Prescriptions, DME and medically necessary transportation ordered for
         the transitioning member by the relinquishing contractor; and

e.       Medical records of the transitioning member (the cost, if any, of
         reproducing and forwarding medical records shall be the responsibility
         of the relinquishing AHCCCS contractor).

When relinquishing members, the Contractor is responsible for timely
notification to the receiving contractor regarding pertinent information related
to any special needs of transitioning members. The Contractor, when receiving a
transitioning member with special needs, is responsible for coordinating care
with the relinquishing contractor in order that services not be interrupted, and
for providing the new member with health plan and service information, emergency
numbers and instructions about how to obtain services.

10.      SCOPE OF SERVICES

The Contractor shall provide covered services to AHCCCS members in accordance
with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, rules, regulations and
policies, including services listed in this document, listed by reference in
attachments, and AHCCCS policies referenced in this document. The services are
described in detail in AHCCCS Rules R9-22, Article 2 and the AHCCCS Medical
Policy Manual (AMPM), all of which are incorporated herein by reference, except
for provisions specific to the Fee-for-Service program, and may be found in the
Bidder's Library. The covered services must be medically necessary and are
briefly described below. Except for behavioral health and children's preventive
dental services, covered services must be provided by, or coordinated with, a
primary care provider. Services must be rendered by providers that are
appropriately licensed or certified, operating within their scope of practice,
and registered as an AHCCCS provider. The Contractor shall provide the same
standard of care for all members regardless of the member's eligibility
category. The Contractor may not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount,
duration, or scope of a required service solely because of the diagnosis, type
of illness, or condition. The Contractor may place

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

appropriate limits on a service on the basis of criteria such as medical
necessity; or for utilization control, provided the services furnished can
reasonably be expected to achieve their purpose.

The Contractor shall ensure that its providers are not restricted or inhibited
in any way from communicating freely with members regarding the members' health
care, medical needs and treatment options, even if needed services are not
covered by the Contractor.

AMBULATORY SURGERY AND ANESTHESIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide surgical
services for either emergency or scheduled surgeries when provided in an
ambulatory or outpatient setting such as a freestanding surgical center or a
hospital based outpatient surgical setting.

AUDIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide audiology services to members under the
age of 21 including the identification and evaluation of hearing loss and
rehabilitation of the hearing loss through medical or surgical means (i.e.
hearing aids). Only the identification and evaluation of hearing loss are
covered for members 21 years of age and older unless the hearing loss is due to
an accident or injury-related emergent condition.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: The Contractor shall provide behavioral health services as
described in Section D, Paragraph 12, Behavioral Health Services.

CHILDREN'S REHABILITATIVE SERVICES (CRS): The program for children with
CRS-covered conditions is administered by the Arizona Department of Health
Services (ADHS) for children who meet CRS eligibility criteria. The Contractor
shall refer children to the CRS program who are potentially eligible for
services related to CRS covered conditions, as specified in R9-22, Article 2 and
A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 2, Article 3. Eligibility criteria and the referral
process are described in the CRS Policy and Procedures Manual available in the
Bidder's Library.

The Contractor shall monitor referrals to CRS to ensure covered services are
provided in a timely manner to eligible members. Referral to CRS does not
relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for providing medically necessary
services not covered by CRS to CRS enrolled members. The Contractor is also
responsible for initial care of newborn members, until those members become
enrolled in CRS. The Contractor must require the member's Primary Care Provider
(PCP) to coordinate their care with the CRS program.

A member with private insurance is not required to utilize CRS. If the member
uses their private insurance network for a CRS covered condition, and the member
is not enrolled with CRS, the Contractor is responsible for all applicable
deductibles and copays.

The Contractor remains ultimately responsible for the provision of all covered
services to its members, except for instances in which the CRS eligible member
refuses to receive CRS covered services through the CRS program. If the
Contractor becomes aware that CRS has failed to provide medically necessary CRS
covered services, the Contractor shall proceed as outlined in the CRS Medically
Necessary Appointment Policy located in the AMPM.

CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES: The Contractor shall provide chiropractic services to
members under age 21 when prescribed by the member's PCP and approved by the
Contractor in order to ameliorate the member's medical condition. Medicare
approved chiropractic services shall also be covered, subject to limitations
specified in CFR 410.22, for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries if prescribed by
the member's PCP and approved by the Contractor.

DENTAL: The Contractor shall provide all members under the age of 21 with all
medically necessary dental services including emergency dental services, dental
screening and preventive services in accordance with the

                                                                Acute Care RFP

AHCCCS periodicity schedule, as well as therapeutic dental services, dentures,
and pre-transplantation dental services. The Contractor shall monitor compliance
with the EPSDT periodicity schedule for dental screening services. The
Contractor is required to meet specific utilization rates for members as
described in Section D, Paragraph 24, Performance Standards. The Contractor
shall ensure that members are notified when dental screenings are due if the
member has not been scheduled for a visit. If a dental screening is not received
by the member, a second notice must be sent. Members under the age of 21 may
request dental services without referral and may choose a dental provider from
the Contractor's provider network. For members who are 21 years of age and
older, the Contractor shall provide emergency dental care, medically necessary
dentures and dental services for transplantation services as specified in the
AMPM.

DIALYSIS: The Contractor shall provide medically necessary dialysis, supplies,
diagnostic testing and medication for all members when provided by
Medicare-certified hospitals or Medicare-certified end stage renal disease
(ESRD) providers. Services may be provided on an outpatient basis, or on an
inpatient basis if the hospital admission is not solely to provide chronic
dialysis services.

EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT (EPSDT): The Contractor
shall provide comprehensive health care services through primary prevention,
early intervention, diagnosis and medically necessary treatment to correct or
ameliorate defects and physical or mental illness discovered by the screenings
for members under age 21. The Contractor shall ensure that these members receive
required health screenings, including those for developmental/behavioral health,
in compliance with the AHCCCS periodicity schedule. The Contractor shall submit
all EPSDT reports to the AHCCCS Office of Medical Management, as required by the
AMPM. The Contractor is required to meet specific participation/utilization
rates for members as described in Section D, Paragraph 24, Performance
Standards.

The Contractor shall ensure the initiation and coordination of a referral to the
ADHS/RBHA system for members in need of behavior health services. The Contractor
shall follow up with the RBHA to monitor whether members have received these
health services.

EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Contractor shall have and/or provide the following as a
minimum:

a.       Emergency services facilities adequately staffed by qualified medical
         professionals to provide pre-hospital, emergency care on a
         24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis, for the sudden onset of a medically
         emergent condition. Emergency medical services are covered without
         prior authorization. The Contractor is encouraged to contract with
         emergency service facilities for the provision of emergency services.
         The Contractor is also encouraged to contract with or employ the
         services of non-emergency facilities (e.g. urgent care centers) to
         address member non-emergency care issues occurring after regular office
         hours or on weekends. The Contractor shall be responsible for educating
         members and providers regarding appropriate utilization of emergency
         room services including behavioral health emergencies. The Contractor
         shall monitor emergency service utilization (by both provider and
         member) and shall have guidelines for implementing corrective action
         for inappropriate utilization;

b.       All medical services necessary to rule out an emergency condition;

c.       Emergency transportation; and

d.       Member access by telephone to a physician, registered nurse, physician
         assistant or nurse practitioner for advice in emergent or urgent
         situations, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

Per the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, CFR 438.114, the following conditions apply
with respect to coverage and payment of emergency services:

The Contractor must cover and pay for emergency services regardless of whether
the provider that furnishes the service has a contract with the Contractor.

The Contractor may not deny payment for treatment obtained under either of the
following circumstances:

         1.       A member had an emergency medical condition, including cases
                  in which the absence of medical attention would not have
                  resulted in the outcomes identified in the definition of
                  emergency medical condition CFR 438.114.

         2.       A representative of the Contractor (an employee or
                  subcontracting provider) instructs the member to seek
                  emergency medical services.

Additionally, the Contractor may not:

         1.       Limit what constitutes an emergency medical condition as
                  defined in CFR 438.114, on the basis of lists of diagnoses or
                  symptoms.

         2.       Refuse to cover emergency services based on the failure of the
                  provider, hospital, or fiscal agent to notify the Contractor
                  of the member's screening and treatment within 10 calendar
                  days of presentation for emergency services. This notification
                  stipulation is only related to the provision of emergency
                  services.

A member who has an emergency medical condition may not be held liable for
payment of subsequent screening and treatment needed to diagnose the specific
condition or stabilize the patient.

The attending emergency physician, or the provider actually treating the member,
is responsible for determining when the member is sufficiently stabilized for
transfer or discharge, and such determination is binding on the Contractor
responsible for coverage and payment. The Contractor shall comply with BBA
guidelines regarding the coordination of post-stabilization care.

EYE EXAMINATIONS/OPTOMETRY: The Contractor shall provide all medically necessary
emergency eye care, vision examinations, prescriptive lenses, and treatments for
conditions of the eye for all members under the age of 21. For members who are
21 years of age and older, the Contractor shall provide emergency care for eye
conditions which meet the definition of an emergency medical condition. Also
covered for this population is cataract removal, and medically necessary vision
examinations and prescriptive lenses, if required, following cataract removal
and other eye conditions as specified in the AMPM.

FAMILY PLANNING: The Contractor shall provide family planning services in
accordance with the AMPM, for all members who choose to delay or prevent
pregnancy. These include medical, surgical, pharmacological and laboratory
services, as well as contraceptive devices. Information and counseling, which
allow members to make informed decisions regarding family planning methods,
shall also be included. If the Contractor does not provide family planning
services, it must contract for these services through another health care
delivery system, which allows members freedom of choice in selecting a provider.

The Contractor shall provide services to members enrolled in the Family Planning
Services Extension Program, a program that provides family planning services
only, for a maximum of 24 months, to women whose SOBRA eligibility has
terminated. The Contractor is also responsible for notifying AHCCCSA when a
SOBRA woman is sterilized to prevent inappropriate enrollment in the SOBRA
Family Planning Services Extension Program. Notification should be made at the
time the newborn is reported or after the sterilization procedure is completed.

HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT AND SCREENING: The Contractor shall provide these
services for non-hospitalized members, 21 years of age and older. These services
include, but are not limited to, screening for hypertension, elevated
cholesterol, colon cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and
HIV/AIDS; nutritional assessment in cases when the member has a chronic
debilitating disease affected by nutritional needs; mammograms and prostate
screenings; physical examinations and diagnostic work-ups; and immunizations.

Members may select or be assigned to a PCP specializing in obstetrics. All
members, anticipated to have a low-risk delivery, may elect to receive labor and
delivery services in their home, if this setting is included in the allowable
settings of the Contractor and the Contractor has providers in its network that
offer home labor and delivery services. All members, anticipated to have a
low-risk prenatal course and delivery, may elect to receive prenatal care, labor
and delivery and postpartum care provided by licensed midwives, if these
providers are in the Contractor's network. All licensed midwife labor and
delivery services must be provided in the member's home, as licensed midwives do
not have admitting privileges in hospitals or AHCCCS registered freestanding
birthing centers. Members receiving maternity services from a licensed midwife
must also be assigned to a PCP for other health care and medical services. The
Contractor shall allow women and their newborns to receive up to 48 hours of
inpatient hospital care after a routine vaginal delivery and up to 96 hours of
inpatient care after a cesarean delivery. The attending health care provider, in
consultation with the mother, may discharge the mother or newborn prior to the
48-hour minimum length of stay. A normal newborn may be granted an extended stay
in the hospital of birth when the mother's continued stay in the hospital is
beyond the 48 or 96 hour stay.

The Contractor shall inform all assigned AHCCCS pregnant women of voluntary
prenatal HIV testing and the availability of medical counseling if the test is
positive. The Contractor shall provide information in the member handbook and
annually in the member newsletter, which encourages pregnant women to be tested
and provides instructions about where testing is available. Semi-annually, the
Contractor shall report to AHCCCS the number of pregnant women who have been
identified as HIV/AIDS positive. This report is due no later than 30 days after
the end of the second and fourth quarters of the contract year.

MEDICAL FOODS: Medical foods are covered within limitations defined in the AMPM
for members diagnosed with a metabolic condition included under the ADHS Newborn
Screening Program and specified in the AMPM. The medical foods, including

DEVICES: These services are covered when prescribed by the member's PCP,
attending physician, practitioner, or by a dentist. Medical equipment may be
rented or purchased only if other sources, which provide the items at no cost,
are not available. The total cost of the rental must not exceed the purchase
price of the item. Reasonable repairs or adjustments of purchased equipment are
covered to make the equipment serviceable and/or when the repair cost is less
than renting or purchasing another unit.

NURSING FACILITY: The Contractor shall provide services in nursing facilities,
including religious non-medical health care institutions, for members who
require short-term convalescent care not to exceed 90 days per contract year. In
lieu of a nursing facility, the member may be placed in an assisted living
facility, an alternative residential setting, or receive home and community
based services (HCBS) as defined in R9-22, Article 2 and R9-28, Article 2 that
meet the provider standards described in R9-28, Article 5, and subject to the
limitations set forth in the AMPM.

services; basic patient care equipment and sickroom supplies; dietary services;
administrative physician visits; non-customized DME; necessary maintenance and
rehabilitation therapies; over-the-counter medications; social, recreational and
spiritual activities; and administrative, operational medical direction
services. See Paragraph 41, Nursing Facility Reimbursement, for further details.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services, in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage, if the stay
goes beyond the 90-day maximum.

POST-STABILIZATION CARE SERVICES COVERAGE AND PAYMENT: Pursuant to 42 CFR
438.114, and 42 CFR 422.113(c), the following conditions apply with respect to
coverage and payment of post-stabilization care services:

The Contractor must cover and pay for post-stabilization care services without
authorization, regardless of whether the provider that furnishes the service has
a contract with the Contractor, for the following situations:

         1.       Post-stabilization care services that were pre-approved by the
                  Contractor; or,

         2.       Post-stabilization care services were not pre-approved by the
                  Contractor because the Contractor did not respond to the
                  treating provider's request for pre-approval within one hour
                  after being requested to approve such care or could not be
                  contacted for pre-approval.

         3.       The Contractor representative and the treating physician
                  cannot reach agreement concerning the enrollee's care and a
                  contractor physician is not available for consultation. In
                  this situation, the Contractor must give the treating
                  physician the opportunity to consult with a contractor
                  physician and the treating physician may continue with care of
                  the patient until a contractor physician is reached or one of
                  the criteria in CFR 422.113(c)(3) is met.

Pursuant to CFR 422.113(c)(3), the Contractor's financial responsibility for
post-stabilization care services that have not been pre-approved ends when:

         1.       A contractor physician with privileges at the treating
                  hospital assumes responsibility for the member's care;

         2.       A contractor physician assumes responsibility for the member's
                  care through transfer;

         3.       A contractor representative and the treating physician reach
                  an agreement concerning the member's care; or

         4.       The member is discharged.

PREGNANCY TERMINATIONS: AHCCCS covers pregnancy termination when it is the
result of rape or incest, or in circumstances where the member suffers from a
physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a life
endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself,
that would, as certified by a physician, place the member in danger of death
unless the pregnancy is terminated. In addition, providers must submit to the
Contractor a Certificate of Medical Necessity for Pregnancy Termination. Prior
authorization is required. If the procedure is performed on an emergency basis,
documentation, outlined in the AMPM, is required for a member under eighteen
years of age or a member who is considered an incapacitated adult who seeks a
medically necessary pregnancy termination, as defined above. The scope of

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS: Medications ordered by a PCP, attending physician or dentist
and dispensed under the direction of a licensed pharmacist are covered subject
to limitations related to prescription supply amounts, contractor formularies
and prior authorization requirements, as well as restrictions for
immunosuppressant drugs addressed in AHCCCS medical policies for
transplantations. Contractors may include over-the-counter medications in their
formulary. An appropriate over-the-counter medication may be prescribed, when it
is determined to be a lower-cost alternative to prescription drugs. See

settings when prescribed by the member's PCP or attending physician, and is
necessary to restore, maintain or improve respiratory functioning.

TRANSPLANTATION OF ORGANS AND TISSUE, AND RELATED IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT DRUGS: These
services are covered within limitations defined in the AMPM for members
diagnosed with specified medical conditions. Such limitations include: whether
the stage of the disease is such that the transplant can affect the outcome; the
member has no other conditions that substantially reduce the potential for
successful transplantation; and whether the member will be able to comply with
necessary and required regimens of treatment. Bone grafts are also covered under
this service. Services include pre-transplant inpatient or outpatient
evaluation; donor search; organ/tissue harvesting or procurement; preparation
and transplantation services; and convalescent care. In addition, if a member
receives, or has received, a transplant covered by a source other than AHCCCS,
medically necessary non-experimental services are provided, within limitations,
after the discharge from the acute care hospitalization for the transplantation.
AHCCCS has contracted with transplantation providers for the Contractor's use or
the Contractor may select its own transplantation provider.

TRANSPORTATION: These services include emergency and non-emergency medically
necessary transportation. Emergency transportation, including transportation
initiated by an emergency response system such as 911, may be provided by
ground, air or water ambulance to manage an AHCCCS member's emergency medical
condition at an emergency scene and transport the member to the nearest
appropriate medical facility. Non-emergency transportation shall be provided

the emergent condition. Triage/screening services must be reasonable, cost
effective and meet the criteria for severity of illness and intensity of
service.

11. SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS

The Contractor must implement mechanisms to identify persons with special health
care needs in accordance with the guidelines provided in the AMPM.

The Contractor must implement mechanisms to assess each member identified as

REFERRALS: As specified in Section D, Paragraph 10, Scope of Services, EPSDT,
the Contractor must provide developmental/behavioral health screenings for
members up to 21 years of age in compliance with the AHCCCS periodicity
schedule. The Contractor shall ensure the initiation and coordination of
behavioral health referrals of these members to the RBHA when determined
necessary through the screening process. The Contractor is responsible for RBHA
referral and follow-up collaboration, as necessary, for other members identified
as needing behavioral health evaluation and treatment. Members may also access
the RBHA system for evaluation by self-referral or be referred by schools, State
agencies or other service providers. The Contractor is responsible for providing
transportation to a member's first RBHA evaluation appointment if a member is
unable to provide his/her own transportation.

EMERGENCY SERVICES: For those members who are not ADHS behavioral health

record is established by the PCP when behavioral health information is received
from the RBHA or provider about an assigned member even if the PCP has not yet
seen the assigned member. In lieu of actually establishing a medical record,
such information may be kept in an appropriately labeled file but must be
associated with the member's medical record as soon as one is established. The
Contractor shall require the PCP to respond to RBHA/provider information
requests pertaining to ADHS behavioral health recipient members including, but
not limited to, current diagnosis, medication, pertinent laboratory results,
last PCP visit, and last hospitalization. For prior period coverage, the
Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary

behavioral disorders) to members with diagnoses of depression, anxiety and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The Contractor shall make available,
on the Contractor's formulary, medications for the treatment of these disorders.

The Contractor shall ensure that training and education are available to PCPs
regarding behavioral health referral and consultation procedures. The Contractor

AHCCCSA, AMPM updates will be available through the Internet at the beginning of
each month. The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining a copy current
with these updates.

14. MEDICAID IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS (MIPS)

Pursuant to an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Department of Education, and
a contract with a Third Party Administrator, AHCCCSA reimburses participating
school districts for specifically identified Medicaid services when provided to
Medicaid eligible children who are included under the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Medicaid services must be identified in
the member's Individual Education Plan (IEP) as medically necessary for the
child to obtain a public school education.

MIPS services are provided in a school setting or other approved setting
specifically to allow children to receive a public school education. They do not
replace medically necessary services provided outside the school setting or
other MIPS approved alternative setting. Currently, services include therapies
(OT, PT and speech/language); behavioral health evaluation and counseling;
nursing and attendant care; and specialized transportation. The Contractor's
evaluations and determinations, about whether services are medically necessary,
should be made independent of the fact that the child is receiving MIPS
services.

Contractors and their providers must coordinate with schools and school
districts that provide MIPS services to the Contractor's enrolled members.
Services should not be duplicative. Contractor case managers, working with
special needs children, should coordinate with school or school district case
managers/special education teachers, working with these members. Transfer of
member medical information and progress toward treatment goals between the
Contractor and the member's school or school district is required and should be
used to enhance the services provided to members.

15. PEDIATRIC IMMUNIZATIONS AND THE VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM

Through the Vaccine for Children Program, the Federal and State governments
purchase, and make available to providers free of charge, vaccines for AHCCCS
children under age 19. The Contractor shall not utilize AHCCCS funding to
purchase vaccines for members under the age of 19. If vaccines are not available
through the VFC Program, the Contractor shall contact the AHCCCSA Office of
Medical Management, Clinical Quality Management Unit. Any provider, licensed by
the State to administer immunizations, may register with ADHS as a "VFC
provider" and receive free vaccines. The Contractor shall comply with all VFC
requirements and monitor its providers to ensure that, if providing
immunizations to AHCCCS members under the age of 19, the providers are
registered with ADHS/VFC.

Arizona State law requires the reporting of all immunizations given to children
under the age of 19. Immunizations must be reported at least monthly to the
ADHS. Reported immunizations are held in a central database known as ASIIS
(Arizona State Immunization Information System), which can be accessed by
providers to obtain complete, accurate immunization records. Software is
available from ADHS to assist providers in meeting this reporting requirement.
Contractors are encouraged to educate their provider network about these
reporting requirements and the use of this resource.

24. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

All Performance Standards described below apply to all member populations.

Contractors must meet AHCCCS stated Minimum Performance Standards. However, it
is equally important that Contractors continually improve their performance
indicator outcomes from year to year. Contractors shall strive to meet the
ultimate standard, or benchmark, established by AHCCCS.

Any statistically significant drop in the Contractor's performance level for any
indicator must be explained by the Contractor in its annual quality management
program evaluation. If a Contractor has a significant drop in any indicator
without a justifiable explanation, it will be required to submit a corrective
action plan and may be subject to sanctions.

AHCCCS has established three levels of performance:

       MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARD - A Minimum Performance Standard is the
       minimal expected level of performance by the Contractor. If a Contractor
       does not achieve this standard, or any indicator declines to a level
       below the AHCCCS Minimum Performance, the Contractor will be required to
       submit a corrective action plan and may be subject to sanctions.

       GOAL - A Goal is a reachable standard for a given performance indicator
       for the Contract Year. If the Contractor has already met or exceeded the
       AHCCCS Minimum Performance Standard for any indicator, the Contractor
       must strive to meet the established Goal for the indicator(s).

       BENCHMARK - A Benchmark is the ultimate standard to be achieved.
       Contractors that have already achieved or exceeded the Goal for any
       performance indicator must strive to meet the Benchmark for the
       indicator(s). Contractors that have achieved the Benchmark are expected
       to maintain this level of performance for future years.

A Contractor that has not shown demonstrable and sustained improvement toward
meeting AHCCCS Performance Standards shall develop a corrective action plan. The
corrective action plan must be received by AHCCCS, Office of Medical Management
within 30 days of receipt of notification from AHCCCS. This plan must be
approved by AHCCCS prior to implementation. AHCCCS may conduct one or more
follow-up onsite

reviews to verify compliance with a corrective action plan. Failure to achieve
adequate improvement may result in sanction imposed by AHCCCS.

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS: The Contractor shall comply with AHCCCS quality
management requirements to improve performance for all AHCCCS established
performance indicators. Complete descriptions of these indicators can be found
in the Technical Specifications section of the most recently published Health
Plan Performance Standards Results and Analysis documents for perinatal,
pediatric and adult/adolescent services. The indicators for postpartum visits
and low birth weight have been eliminated as contractual performance standards.
The Contractor shall continue to monitor rates for postpartum visits and low
birth weights and implement interventions as necessary to improve or sustain
these rates. These activities will be monitored by AHCCCSA during the
Operational and Financial Review.

CMS has been working in partnership with states in developing core performance
measures for Medicaid and SCHIP programs. The current AHCCCS established
performance indicators may be subject to change when these core measures are
finalized and implemented.

In addition, AHCCCS has established standards for the following indicators:

EPSDT PARTICIPATION: The Contractor shall take affirmative steps to increase
member participation in the EPSDT program. The participation rate is the number
of children younger than 21 years receiving at least one medical screen during
the contract year, compared to the number of children expected to receive at
least one medical screen. The number of children expected to receive at least
one medical screen is based on the AHCCCS EPSDT periodicity schedule and the
average period of eligibility.

PEDIATRIC IMMUNIZATIONS: The Contractor shall ensure members under age 21
receive age-appropriate immunizations as specified in the AMPM.

The Contractor shall participate in immunization audits, at intervals specified
by AHCCCSA, based on random sampling to assess and verify the immunization
status of two-year-old members. AHCCCS will provide the Contractor the selected
sample, specifications for conducting the audit, the AHCCCSA reporting
requirements, and technical assistance. The Contractor shall identify each
child's PCP, conduct the assessment, and report to AHCCCSA, in the required
format, all immunization data for the two-year-old children sampled. If medical
records are missing for more than 5 percent of the sample group, the Contractor
is subject to sanctions by AHCCCSA. An External Quality Review Organization
(EQRO) may conduct a study to validate the Contractor's reported rates.

The following table identifies the Minimum Performance Standards, Goals and
Benchmarks for each indicator:

25. GRIEVANCE AND REQUEST FOR HEARING PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance process for enrollees and
providers, which defines their rights regarding disputed matters with the
Contractor. The Contractor shall provide the appropriate personnel to establish,
implement and maintain the necessary functions related to the grievance systems
process. Refer to Attachment H(1) and H(2) for Enrollee Grievance System
Standards and Policy and Provider Grievance System Standards and Policy,
respectively.

The grievance process shall be in accordance with applicable Federal and State
laws, regulations and policies, including, but not limited to 42 CFR Part 438
Subpart F. The Contractor shall ensure compliance with Attachment H. Contractor
shall also ensure that it timely provides written information to both enrollees
and providers, which clearly explains the grievance system requirements.
Information to enrollees must meet cultural competency and limited English
proficiency requirements as specified in the AHCCCS Cultural Competency Policy
and Section D, Paragraph 18, Member Information.

The Contractor shall be responsible to provide the necessary professional,
paraprofessional and clerical services for the representation of the Contractor
in all issues relating to the grievance system and any other matters arising
under this contract which rise to the level of administrative hearing or a
judicial proceeding.

26. QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE  REPORT

The Contractor shall submit a Quarterly Grievance Report to AHCCCSA, Office of
Legal Assistance, using the Quarterly Grievance System Report Format. The
Quarterly Grievance System Report must be received by the AHCCCSA, Office of
Legal Assistance, no later than 45 days from the end of the quarter.

27. NETWORK DEVELOPMENT

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is sufficient
to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members. It shall ensure covered
services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in terms of
location and hours of operation. There shall be sufficient personnel for the
provision of covered services, including emergency medical care on a
24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis. The proposed network shall be

                                                                Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

sufficient to provide covered services within designated time and distance
limits. For Maricopa and Pima Counties only, this includes a network such that
95% of its members residing within the boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix and
Tucson do not have to travel more than 5 miles to see a PCP, dentist or
pharmacy. Ninety-five percent of its members residing outside the boundary area
must not have to travel more than 10 miles to see such providers. PCPs and
specialists who provide inpatient services to the Contractor's members shall
have admitting and treatment privileges in a minimum of one general acute care
hospital within the Contractor's service area. Hospitalists may satisfy this
requirement. Contractors in Maricopa and/or Pima counties must have at least one
hospital contract in each of the service districts specified in Attachment B.

Contractors must provide a comprehensive provider network that ensures its
membership has access at least equal to, or better than, community norms.
Services shall be as accessible to AHCCCS members in terms of timeliness,
amount, duration and scope as those services are to non-AHCCCS persons within
the same service area. The Contractor is expected to consider the full spectrum
of care when developing its network. The Contractor must also consider
communities whose residents typically receive care in neighboring states. If the
Contractor is unable to provide those services locally, it must so demonstrate
to AHCCCSA and shall provide reasonable alternatives for members to access care.
These alternatives must be approved by AHCCCSA. If the Contractor's network is
unable to provide medically necessary services required under contract, the
Contractor must adequately and timely cover these services through an out of
network provider until a network provider is contracted. The Contractor and out
of network provider must coordinate with respect to authorization and payment
issues in these circumstances.

The Contractor is also encouraged to develop non-financial incentive programs to
increase participation in its provider network.

The Contractor shall not discriminate with respect to participation in the
AHCCCS program, reimbursement or indemnification against any provider based
solely on the provider's type of licensure or certification. In addition, the
Contractor must not discriminate against particular providers that service
high-risk populations or specialize in conditions that require costly treatment.
This provision, however, does not prohibit the Contractor from limiting provider
participation to the extent necessary to meet the needs of the Contractor's
members. This provision also does not interfere with measures established by the
Contractor to control costs consistent with its responsibilities under this
contract. If a Contractor declines to include individual or groups of providers
in its network, it must give the affected providers written notice of the reason
for its decision. The Contractor may not include providers excluded from
participation in Federal health care programs, under either section 1128 or
section 1128A of the Social Security Act.

See Attachment B, Minimum Network Requirements, for details on network
requirements by Geographic Service Area.

PROVIDER NETWORK DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT PLAN: The Contractor shall develop
and maintain a provider network development and management plan, which ensures
that the provision of covered services will occur as stated above. This plan
shall be updated annually and submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, 45
days from the start of each contract year. The plan shall identify the current
status of the Contractor's network, and project future needs based upon, at a
minimum, membership growth; the number and types (in terms of training,
experience and specialization) of providers that exist in the Contractor's
service area; the expected utilization of services, given the characteristics of
its population and its health care needs; the numbers of providers not accepting
new Medicaid patients; and access of its membership to specialty services as
compared to the general population of the community. The plan, at a minimum,
shall also include the following:

         a.       current network gaps;

         b.       immediate short-term interventions when a gap occurs,
                  including expedited or temporary credentialing;

         c.       interventions to fill network gaps and barriers to those
                  interventions;

                                                                Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

         d.       outcome measures/evaluation of interventions;

         e.       ongoing activities for network development;

         f.       coordination between internal departments;

         g.       coordination with outside organizations and

         h.       specialty populations.

28. PROVIDER AFFILIATION  TRANSMISSION

The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its provider
network. This information shall be submitted in the format described in the
Provider Affiliation Transmission User Manual on October 15, January 15, April
15, and July 15 of each contract year. The manual may be found in the Bidder's
Library. If the provider affiliation transmission is not timely, accurate and
complete, the Contractor may be required to submit a corrective action plan and
may be subject to sanction.

29. NETWORK MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that pertain to all
service specifications described in the AMPM. In addition, the Contractor shall
have policies on how the Contractor will:

a.       Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/or program
         changes and requirements;

b.       Monitor network compliance with policies and rules of AHCCCSA and the
         Contractor, including compliance with all policies and procedures
         related to the grievance process and ensuring the member's care is not
         compromised during the grievance process;

c.       Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network;

d.       Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services should the
         network become temporarily insufficient within the contracted service
         area;

e.       Monitor the adequacy, accessibility and availability of its provider
         network to meet the needs of its members, including the provision of
         care to members with limited proficiency in English; and

f.       Process expedited and temporary credentials.

Contractor policies shall be subject to approval by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, and shall be monitored through operational audits.

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. A material change is defined as one
which affects, or can reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability
to meet the performance and network standards as described in this contract.
AHCCCSA will assess proposed changes in the Contractor's provider network for
potential impact on members' health care and provide a written response to the
Contractor. For emergency situations, AHCCCSA will expedite the approval
process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within one working
day of any unexpected changes that would impair its provider network. This
notification shall include (1) information about how the change will affect the
delivery of covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for maintaining the
quality of member care, if the provider network change is likely to affect the
delivery of covered services.

30. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER  STANDARDS

The Contractor shall include in its provider network a sufficient number of PCPs
to meet the requirements of this contract. Health care providers designated by
the Contractor as PCPs shall be licensed in Arizona as

                                                                Acute Care RFP

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

allopathic or osteopathic physicians who generally specialize in family
practice, internal medicine, obstetrics, gynecology, or pediatrics; certified
nurse practitioners or certified nurse midwifes; or physician's assistants.

The Contractor shall assess the PCP's ability to meet AHCCCS appointment
availability and other standards when determining the appropriate number of its
members to be assigned to a PCP. The Contractor should also consider the PCP's
total panel size (i.e. AHCCCS and non-AHCCCS patients) when making this
determination. AHCCCS members shall not comprise the majority of a PCP's panel
of patients. AHCCCSA shall inform the Contractor when a PCP has a panel of more
than 1,800 AHCCCS members (assigned by a single Contractor or multiple
Contractors), to assist in the assessment of the size of their panel. This
information will be provided on a quarterly basis. The Contractor will adjust
the size of a PCP's panel, as needed, for the PCP to meet AHCCCS standards.

The Contractor shall have a system in place to monitor and ensure that each
member is assigned to an individual PCP and that the Contractor's data regarding
PCP assignments is current. The Contractor is encouraged to assign members with
complex medical conditions, who are age 12 and younger, to board certified
pediatricians. PCP's, with assigned members diagnosed with AIDS or as HIV
positive, shall meet criteria and standards set forth in the AMPM.

To the extent required by this contract, the Contractor shall offer members
freedom of choice within its network in selecting a PCP. The Contractor may
restrict this choice when a member has shown an inability to form a relationship
with a PCP, as evidenced by frequent changes, or when there is a medically
necessary reason. When a new member has been assigned to the Contractor, the
Contractor shall inform the member in writing of his enrollment and of his PCP
assignment within 10 days of the Contractor's receipt of notification of
assignment by AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall include with the enrollment
notification a list of all the Contractor's available PCPs, the process for
changing the PCP assignment, should the member desire to do so, as well as the
information required in the AHCCCS Office of Managed Care Member Information
Policy. The Contractor shall confirm any PCP change in writing to the member.
Members may make both their initial PCP selection and any subsequent PCP changes
either verbally or in writing.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall hold the PCP responsible for the following
gatekeeping activities:

a.       Supervision, coordination and provision of care to each assigned
         member;

b.       Initiation of referrals for medically necessary specialty care;

c.       Maintaining continuity of care for each assigned member; and

d.       Maintaining the member's medical record, including documentation of all
         services provided to the member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or
         referral services.

The Contractor shall establish and implement policies and procedures to monitor
PCP gatekeeping activities and to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of,
and receive documentation regarding, specialty and referral services provided to
assigned members by specialty physicians, and other health care professionals.
Contractor policies and procedures shall be subject to approval by AHCCCSA,
Office of Managed Care, and shall be monitored through operational audits.

31. MATERNITY CARE PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is designated for
each pregnant member for the duration of her pregnancy and postpartum care and
that maternity services are provided in accordance with the AMPM. The Contractor
may include in its provider network the following maternity care providers:

a.       Arizona licensed allopathic and/or osteopathic physicians who are
         general practitioners or specialize in family practice or obstetrics

                                                                Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

b.       Physician Assistants

c.       Nurse Practitioners

d.       Certified Nurse Midwives

Pregnant members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetrical
care. Such assignment shall be consistent with the freedom of choice
requirements for selecting health care professionals while ensuring that the
continuity of care is not compromised. Members who choose to receive maternity
services from a licensed midwife shall also be assigned to a PCP for medical
care, as primary care is not within the scope of practice for licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform deliveries shall have OB
hospital privileges or a documented hospital coverage agreement for those
practitioners performing deliveries in alternate settings. Licensed midwives
perform deliveries only in the member's home. Labor and delivery services may
also be provided in the member's home by physicians, certified nurse
practitioners and certified nurse midwives who include such services within
their practice.

32. REFERRAL PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have adequate written procedures regarding referrals to
specialists, to include, at a minimum, the following:

a.       Use of referral forms clearly identifying the Contractor

b.       A system for resolving disputes regarding the referrals

c.       PCP referral shall be required for specialty physician services, except
         that women shall have direct access to in-network GYN providers,
         including physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners
         within the scope of their practice, without a referral for preventive
         and routine services. In addition, for members with special health care
         needs determined to need a specialized course of treatment or regular
         care monitoring, the Contractor must have a mechanism in place to allow
         such members to directly access a specialist (for example through a
         standing referral or an approved number of visits) as appropriate for
         the member's condition and identified needs. Any waiver of this
         requirement by the Contractor must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA.

d.       Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment for a
         medical condition other than that for which the member was referred,
         unless approved by the member's PCP.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures about educating its
provider network regarding appointment time requirements. The Contractor must
assign a specific staff member or unit within its organization to monitor
compliance with appointment standards. The Contractor must develop a corrective
action plan when appointment standards are not met; if appropriate, the
corrective action plan should be developed in conjunction with the provider.
Appointment standards shall be included in the Provider Manual. The Contractor
is encouraged to include the standards in the provider subcontract.

34. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC)

The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs in Arizona to provide covered services
and must comply with the Federal mandates. Section 4712(b)(2) of the Balanced
Budget Act requires that "rates of payment between FQHCs/RHCs and MCOs shall not
be less than the amount of payment for a similar set of services with a non-
FQHC/RHC." The intention of this provision is to ensure that contractors
negotiate rates of payment with FQHCs that are comparable to the rates paid to
providers that provide similar services.

Contractors are required to submit member information for Title XIX members for
each FQHC on a quarterly basis to the AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care. AHCCCSA
will perform periodic audits of the member information submitted. Contractors
should refer to the AHCCCS Office of Managed Care's policy on FQHC reimbursement
for further guidance. The following FQHCs are currently recognized by CMS:

                  Canyonlands Community Health Care
                  Chiricahua Community Health Centers, Inc.
                  Clinica Adelante, Inc.
                  Community Health Center of West Yavapai

                  Center, Inc.)
                  United Community Health Center, Inc.

35. PROVIDER MANUAL

The Contractor shall develop, distribute and maintain a provider manual. The
Contractor shall ensure that each contracted provider is issued a copy of the
provider manual and is encouraged to distribute a provider manual to any
individual or group that submits claim and encounter data. The Contractor
remains liable for ensuring that all providers, whether contracted or not, meet
the applicable AHCCCS requirements such as covered services, billing, etc. At a
minimum, the Contractor's provider manual must contain information on the
following:

     the English or who use sign language.

z.   Peer review and appeal process.

36. PROVIDER REGISTRATION

The Contractor shall ensure that all of its subcontractors register with AHCCCSA
as an approved service provider and receive an AHCCCS Provider ID Number. A
Provider Participation Agreement must be signed by each provider who does not
already have a current AHCCCS ID number. The original shall be forwarded to
AHCCCSA. This provider registration process must be completed in order for the
Contractor to report services a subcontractor renders to enrolled members and
for the Contractor to be paid reinsurance.

37. SUBCONTRACTS

The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract performance whether or
not subcontracts are used. No subcontract shall operate to terminate the legal
responsibility of the Contractor to assure that all activities carried out by
the subcontractor conform to the provisions of this contract. Subject to such
conditions, any function required to be provided by the Contractor pursuant to
this contract may be subcontracted to a qualified person or organization. All
such subcontracts must be in writing. See the AHCCCS Claims Processing by
Subcontracted Providers Policy in the Bidder's Library.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any provider (including
out-of-state providers) the Contractor reasonably anticipates will be providing
services on its behalf more than 25 times during the contract year. Exceptions
to this requirement include the following:

     year refuses to enter into a written agreement with the Contractor, the
     Contractor shall submit documentation of such refusal to AHCCCS, Office of
     Managed Care within seven days of its final attempt to gain such agreement.

b.   If a provider performs emergency services such as an emergency room
     physician or an ambulance company, a written agreement is not required.

c.   Individual providers as detailed in the AMPM.

d.   Hospitals, as discussed in Section D, Paragraph 40, Hospital Subcontracting
     and Reimbursement.

These and any other exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AHCCCS,
Office of Managed Care. Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the
provisions of Attachment A, Minimum Subcontract Provisions. In addition, each

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

i.   Specification that the subcontractor shall cooperate with quality
     management/quality improvement programs, and comply with the utilization
     management and review procedures specified in the AMPM.

j.   A provision stating that a merger, reorganization or change in ownership of
     a subcontractor that is related to or affiliated with the Contractor shall
     require a contract amendment and prior approval of AHCCCSA.

k.   Procedures for enrollment or re-enrollment of the covered population (may
     also refer to the Provider Manual).

l.   A provision that the subcontractor shall be fully responsible for all tax
     obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all other applicable
     insurance coverage obligations which arise under this subcontract, for
     itself and its employees, and that AHCCCSA shall have no responsibility or
     liability for any such taxes or insurance coverage.

m.   A provision that the subcontractor must obtain any necessary authorization
     from the Contractor or AHCCCSA for services provided to eligible and/or
     enrolled members.

n.   A provision that the subcontractor must comply with encounter reporting and
     claims submission requirements as described in the subcontract.

38. CLAIMS PAYMENT SYSTEM

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system capable of
processing, cost avoiding and paying claims in accordance with ARS 36-2904(H)
and (J), AHCCCS Rules R9-22-705, and R9-22-709, a copy of which may be found in
the Bidder's Library. In the absence of a subcontract provision to the contrary,
claims submission deadlines shall be calculated from the date of service or the
effective date of eligibility posting, whichever is later. Remittance advices
accompanying the Contractor's payments to providers must contain, at a minimum,
adequate descriptions of all denials and adjustments, the reasons for such
denials and adjustments, the amount billed, the amount paid, and grievance and
request for hearing rights. The Contractor's claims payment system, as well as
its prior authorization and concurrent review process, must minimize the
likelihood of having to recoup already-paid claims. Any recoupment in excess of
$50,000 per provider within a contract year must be approved in advance by
AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

In accordance with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, unless a subcontract
specifies otherwise, the Contractor shall ensure that 90% of all clean claims
are paid within 30 days of receipt of the clean claim and 99% are paid within 90
days of receipt of the clean claim. Additionally, unless a subcontract specifies
otherwise, the Contractor shall not require providers to initially submit claims
earlier than 6 months after date of service or to submit clean claims earlier
than 12 months after date of service for which payment is claimed. The receipt
date of the claim is the date stamp on the claim. The paid date of the claim is
the date on the check or other form of payment.

39. SPECIALTY CONTRACTS

AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the Contractor and
AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical services. AHCCCSA will consider
existing Contractor resources in the development and execution of specialty
contracts. AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contracts. Specialty contracts shall
take precedence over, and supersede, existing and future subcontracts for
services that are subject to specialty contracts. AHCCCSA may consider waiving
this requirement in particular situations if such action is determined to be in
the best interest of the State; however, in no case shall reimbursement exceed
that payable under the relevant AHCCCSA specialty contract.

During the term of specialty contracts, AHCCCSA may act as an intermediary
between the Contractor and specialty contractors to enhance the cost
effectiveness of service delivery. AHCCCSA reserves the right to make direct
payments to specialty contractors on behalf of the Contractor. Adjudication of
claims related to such payments provided under specialty contracts shall remain
the responsibility of the Contractor. AHCCCSA may provide technical assistance
prior to the implementation of any specialty contracts.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Currently, AHCCCSA only has specialty contracts for transplant services. AHCCCSA
shall provide at least 60 days advance written notice to the Contractor prior to
the implementation of any specialty contract.

40. HOSPITAL SUBCONTRACTING AND REIMBURSEMENT

MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTIES ONLY: Legislation authorizes the Hospital
Reimbursement Pilot Program (Pilot), which is effective from October 1, 2001,
through September 30, 2003. Legislation to extend the Pilot may be introduced
for CYE '04. The Pilot, as defined by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-718, requires hospital
subcontracts to be negotiated between health plans in Maricopa and Pima counties
and hospitals to establish reimbursement levels, terms and conditions.
Subcontracts shall be negotiated by the Contractor and hospitals to cover
operational concerns, such as timeliness of claims submission and payment,
payment of discounts or penalties and legal resolution which may, as an option,
include establishing arbitration procedures. These negotiated subcontracts shall
remain under close scrutiny by AHCCCSA to ensure availability of quality
services within specific service districts, equity of related party interests
and reasonableness of rates. The general provisions of this program encompass
acute care hospital services and outpatient hospital services that result in an
admission. The Contractor shall submit all hospital subcontracts and any
amendments to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. For non-emergency patient-days,
the Contractor shall ensure that at least 65% of its members use contracted
hospitals. AHCCCSA reserves the right to subsequently adjust the 65% standard.
Further, if in AHCCCSA's judgment the number of emergency days at a particular
non-contracted hospital becomes significant, AHCCCSA may require a subcontract
at that hospital.

ALL COUNTIES EXCEPT MARICOPA AND PIMA: The Contractor shall reimburse hospitals
for member care in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. The Contractor is
encouraged to obtain subcontracts with hospitals in all GSA's and must submit
copies of these subcontracts, including amendments, to AHCCCSA, Office of
Managed Care, at least seven days prior to the effective dates thereof.

OUT-OF-STATE HOSPITALS: The Contractor shall reimburse out-of-state hospitals in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. Contractors serving border communities
(excluding Mexico) are strongly encouraged to establish contractual agreements
with those out-of-state hospitals that are identified by GSA in Attachment B.

HOSPITAL RECOUPMENTS: The Contractor may conduct prepayment and post-payment
medical reviews of all hospital claims including outlier claims. Erroneously
paid claims are subject to recoupment. If the Contractor fails to identify lack
of medical necessity through concurrent review and/or prepayment medical review,
lack of medical necessity identified during post-payment medical review shall
not constitute a basis for recoupment by the Contractor. This prohibition does
not apply to recoupments that are a result of an AHCCCS reinsurance audit. See
also Section D, Paragraph 38, Claims Payment System. For a more complete
description of the guidelines for hospital reimbursement, please consult the
Bidder's Library for applicable statutes and rules.

41. NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the nursing facility
is unable to obtain prior authorization in situations where acute care
eligibility and ALTCS eligibility overlap and the member is enrolled with an
AHCCCS acute care contractor. In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements. The Contractor's payment responsibility,
described above, applies only in situations where the nursing facility has not
been notified in advance of the member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care
contractor. When ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute care enrollment, the
acute care enrollment takes precedence. Although the member could be ALTCS
eligible for this time period, there is no ALTCS enrollment that occurs on the
same days as AHCCCS acute enrollment.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

The Contractor shall provide medically necessary nursing facility services for
any member who has a pending ALTCS application, who is currently residing in a
nursing facility and is eligible for services provided under this contract. If
the member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS Program
Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days per contract year of nursing
facility coverage, the Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility
coverage during the time the member is enrolled with the Contractor. Nursing
facility services, covered by a third party insurer (including Medicare) while
the member is enrolled with the Contractor, shall be applied to the 90 day per
contract year limitation.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application process and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the
stay goes beyond the 90-day per contract year maximum.

42. PHYSICIAN INCENTIVES

The Contractor must comply with all applicable physician incentive requirements
and conditions defined in 42 CFR 417.479. These regulations prohibit physician
incentive plans that directly or indirectly make payments to a doctor or a group
as an inducement to limit or refuse medically necessary services to a member.
The Contractor is required to disclose all physician incentive agreements to
AHCCCSA and to AHCCCS members who request them.

The Contractor shall not enter into contractual arrangements that place
providers at significant financial risk as defined in CFR 417.479 unless
specifically approved in advance by the AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care. In order
to obtain approval, the following must be submitted to the AHCCCSA Office of
Managed Care 45 days prior to the implementation of the contract:

     1.   A complete copy of the contract

     2.   A plan for the member satisfaction survey

     3.   Details of the stop-loss protection provided

     4.   A summary of the compensation arrangement that meets the substantial
          financial risk definition.

The Contractor shall disclose to AHCCCSA the information on physician incentive
plans listed in 42 CFR 417.479(h)(1) through 417.479(I) upon contract renewal,
prior to initiation of a new contract, or upon request from AHCCCSA or CMS.
Please refer to the Physician Incentive Plan Disclosure by Contractors Policy in
the Bidder's Library for details on providing required disclosures.

The Contractor shall also provide for compliance with physician incentive plan
requirements as set forth in 42 CFR 422. These regulations apply to contract
arrangements with subcontracted entities that provide utilization management
services.

43. MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTORS

All proposed management services subcontracts and/or corporate cost allocation
plans must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, as
described in Section D, Paragraph 37, Subcontracts. Cost allocation plans must
be submitted with the proposed management fee agreement. AHCCCSA reserves the
right to perform a thorough review of actual management fees charged and/or
corporate allocations made. If the fees or allocations actually paid out are
determined to be unjustified or excessive, amounts may be subject to repayment
to the Contractor. The Contractor may be placed on monthly financial reporting,
and/or financial sanctions may be imposed.

of that consultant or actuary.

45. MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered for a contract award, the Offeror must meet a minimum
capitalization requirement for each GSA bid. The capitalization requirement for
both new and continuing offerors must be met within 30 days after contract
award.

Minimum capitalization requirements by GSA are as follows:

</TABLE>

*Yavapai's minimum capitalization requirement for both new and existing offerors
is limited to $150 times the estimated number of members.

NEW OFFERORS: To be considered for a contract award in a given GSA or group of
GSA's, a new offeror must meet the minimum capitalization requirements listed
above. The capitalization requirement is subject to a $10,000,000 ceiling
regardless of the number of GSA's awarded. This requirement is in addition to
the Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 46 and 47 below and must
be met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a loan subject to repayment. The
capitalization requirement may be applied toward meeting the equity per member
requirement (see Section D, Paragraph 50, Financial Viability
Standards/Performance Guidelines) and is intended for use in operations of the
Contractor.

CONTINUING OFFERORS: Continuing offerors that are bidding a county or GSA in
which they currently have a contract must meet the equity per member standard
(see Section D, Paragraph 50, Financial Viability Standards/Performance
Guidelines) for their current membership. Continuing offerors that do not meet
the equity standard must fund, through capital contribution, the necessary
amount to meet the minimum capitalization requirement. Continuing offerors that
are bidding a new GSA must provide the additional capitalization for the new GSA
they are bidding. The amount of the required capitalization for continuing
offers may differ from that for new offerors due to size of the existing
offerors current enrollment. (See the table of requirements by GSA above).

Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional capitalization if
they currently meet the equity per member standard with their existing
membership and their excess equity is sufficient to cover the proposed
additional members, or they have at least $10,000,000 in equity.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

46. PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE

The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of standard
commercial scope issued by a surety company doing business in this State, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit ("Performance Bond") to AHCCCSA
for as long as the Contractor has AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000 or more
outstanding, or 15 months following the effective date of this contract,
whichever is later, to guarantee: (1) payment of the Contractor's obligations to
providers, non-contracting providers, and non-providers; and (2) performance by
the Contractor of its obligations under this contract. The Performance Bond
shall be in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA as described in the AHCCCS Performance
Bond Policy available in the Bidder's Library.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in addition to any
other remedies it may have under this contract, obtain payment under the
Performance Bond or substitute security for the purposes of the following:

a.   Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting providers and
     non-providers by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under
     this contract,

b.   Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on behalf of the
     Contractor, and

c.   Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative expenses incurred
     by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under this contract,
     including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after termination of this
     contract for reasons other than the convenience of the State by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu of the
Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit, the Contractor
agrees to execute any and all documents and perform any and all acts necessary
to secure and enforce AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and necessary UCC filings
pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code. In the event such substitute
security is agreed to and accepted by AHCCCSA, the Contractor acknowledges that
it has granted AHCCCSA a security interest in such substitute security to secure
performance of its obligations under this contract. The Contractor is solely
responsible for establishing the credit-worthiness of all forms of substitute
security. AHCCCSA may, after written notice to the Contractor, withdraw its
permission for substitute security, in which case the Contractor shall provide
AHCCCSA with a form of security described above. The Contractor may not change
the amount, duration or scope of the performance bond without prior written
approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

The Contractor shall not leverage the bond for another loan or create other
creditors using the bond as security.

47. AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND

The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 80% of the total
capitation payment expected to be paid to the Contractor in the month of October
2003, or as determined by AHCCCSA. The total capitation amount shall include
delivery and hospital supplemental payments. This requirement must be satisfied
by the Contractor no later than 30 days after notification by AHCCCSA of the
amount required. Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the enrollment statistics of
the Contractor on a monthly basis to determine if the Performance Bond must be
increased. The Contractor shall have 30 days following notification by AHCCCSA
to increase the amount of the Performance Bond. The Performance Bond amount that
must be maintained after the contract term shall be sufficient to cover all
outstanding liabilities and will be determined by AHCCCSA. The Contractor may
not change the amount of the performance bond without prior written approval
from AHCCCS, Office of Managed Care. Refer to the Performance Bond/Equity Per
Member Policy for more details.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

48. ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT

The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund deficit through
capital contributions in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA within 30 days after
receipt by AHCCCSA of the final audited financial statements, or as otherwise
requested by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in any
or all GSA's as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if unaudited.

49. ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS

The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA, make any
advances to a related party or subcontractor. The Contractor shall not, without
similar prior approval, make any distribution, loan or loan guarantee to any
entity, including another fund or line of business within its organization. All
investments, other than investments in U.S. Government securities or
Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA prior approval. (See the Reporting
Guide for Acute Care Contractors for alternatives to the prior approval of
individual investments.) All requests for prior approval are to be submitted to
the AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care.

50. FINANCIAL VIABILITY STANDARDS/PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES

AHCCCSA has established financial viability standards/performance guidelines. On
a quarterly basis, AHCCCSA will review the following ratios with the purpose of
monitoring the financial health of the Contractor. The two financial viability
standards, the Current Ratio and Equity per Member, are the standards that best
represent the financial solvency of the Contractor. Therefore, the Contractor
must comply with these two financial viability standards.

AHCCCSA will also monitor the Medical Expense Ratio, the Administrative Cost
Percentage, and the RBUC's Days Outstanding. These guidelines are analyzed as
part of AHCCCSA's due diligence in financial statement monitoring. Sanctions may
not be imposed if the Contractor does not meet these performance guidelines.
AHCCCSA takes into account Contractors' unique programs for managing care and
improving the heath status of members when analyzing medical expense and
administrative ratio results. However, if a critical combination of the
Financial Viability Standards and Performance Guidelines are not met, or if a
Contractor's experience differs significantly from other Contractors',
additional monitoring, such as monthly reporting, may be required.

FINANCIAL VIABILITY STANDARDS

CURRENT RATIO                       Current assets divided by current
                                    liabilities. "Current assets" includes any
                                    long-term investments that can be converted
                                    to cash within 24 hours without significant
                                    penalty (i.e., greater than 20%).

                                    Standard: At least 1.00

                                    If current assets include a receivable from
                                    a parent company, the parent company must
                                    have liquid assets that support the amount
                                    of the inter-company loan.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

                                    For purposes of this measurement, the equity
                                    to be measured must be supported by
                                    unencumbered current assets.

                                    (Failure to meet this standard may result in
                                    an enrollment cap being imposed in any or
                                    all contracted GSAs.)

51. SEPARATE INCORPORATION

Within 60 days of contract award, a non-governmental contractor shall have
established a separate corporation for the purposes of this contract, whose sole
activity is the performance of contract function with AHCCCS.

52. MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the Contractor shall
require prior approval of AHCCCSA and a subsequent contract amendment. The
Contractor must submit a detailed merger, reorganization and/or transition plan
to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, for review. The purpose of the plan review
is to ensure uninterrupted services to members, evaluate the new entity's
ability to support the provider network, ensure that services to members are not
diminished and that major components of the organization and AHCCCS programs are
not adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or change in ownership.

53. COMPENSATION

The method of compensation under this contract will be Prior Period Coverage
(PPC) capitation, prospective capitation, delivery supplement, hospitalized
supplement for Medical Expense Deduction (MED) members, HIV-AIDS supplement,
reinsurance and third party liability, as described and defined within this
contract and appropriate laws, regulations or policies.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Capitation rates awarded with the RFP will be effective for the period October
1, 2003 through September 30, 2004. Actuaries establish the capitation rates
using practices established by the Actuarial Standards Board. AHCCCS provides
the following data to its actuaries to establish rates for the purposes of
rebasing the capitation rates.

     a.   Utilization and unit cost data derived from reported encounters

     b.   Audited financial statements reported by Contractors

     c.   Local market basket inflation trends

     d.   AHCCCS fee for service schedule pricing adjustments

     e.   Programmatic changes that affect reimbursement

     f.   Additional administrative requirements for Contractors

     g.   Other changes to medical practices that affect reimbursement

AHCCCS adjusts its rates to best match payment to risk. This further ensures the
actuarial basis for the capitation rates. The following risk factors will be
included for CYE '04:

     a.   Reinsurance (as described in Paragraph 57)

     b.   HIV/AIDS supplemental payment

     c.   Age/Gender for the 1931(b), SOBRA, KidsCare and BCCTP eligibility
          groups

     d.   Medicare enrollment for SSI members

     e.   Delivery supplemental payment

     f.   Hospitalized supplemental payments for MED members

     g.   Geographic Service Area adjustments

     h.   Risk sharing for Title XIX Waiver Group reimbursement

     i.   Risk sharing for PPC reimbursement

     j.   Member choice statistic for Title XIX Waiver Group

The above information is reviewed by AHCCCS' actuaries in renewal years to
determine if adjustments are necessary to maintain actuarially sound rates. A
Contractor may cover services for members that are not covered under the State
Plan; however those services are not included in the data provided to actuaries
for setting capitation rates. In addition to the above data used to review the
appropriateness of capitation rates, during renewal years, AHCCCS may look at
other factors that potentially impact appropriate reimbursement including the
medical cost experience of members who exercise their right to choose a health
plan upon initial enrollment versus those who are auto assigned to a health
plan.

PROSPECTIVE CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation for all
prospective member months, including partial member months. This capitation
includes the cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members
during the prospective period coverage.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE (PPC) CAPITATION: Except for KidsCare members and HIFA
Parents, the Contractor will be paid capitation for all PPC member months,
including partial member months. This capitation includes the cost of providing
medically necessary covered services to members during prior period coverage.
The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA and will be paid to the
Contractor along with the prospective capitation described below. Contractors
will not receive PPC capitation for newborns of members who were enrolled at the
time of delivery.

RECONCILIATION OF PPC COSTS TO REIMBURSEMENT: For CYE '04, AHCCCSA will
reconcile the Contractor's PPC medical cost expenses to PPC capitation paid to
the Contractor during the year. This reconciliation will limit the Contractor's
profits and losses to 2%. Any losses in excess of 2% will be reimbursed to the
Contractor, and likewise, profits in excess of 2% will be recouped. Encounter
data will be used to determine medical expenses. Refer to the AHCCCS Office of
Managed Care's PPC Reconciliation Policy for further details.

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

RISK SHARING FOR TITLE XIX WAIVER MEMBERS: For CYE '04, AHCCCSA will reconcile
the Contractor's PPC and prospective medical cost expenses to PPC capitation,
prospective capitation, hospitalized supplemental payments, delivery
supplemental payments and HIV/AIDS supplemental payments paid to the Contractor
during the year. This reconciliation will limit the Contractor's profits and
losses to 2%. Any losses in excess of 2% will be reimbursed to the Contractor,
and likewise, profits in excess of 2% will be recouped. Encounter data will be
used to determine medical expenses. Refer to the AHCCCS Office of Managed Care's
Title XIX Waiver Reconciliation Policy for further details.

DELIVERY SUPPLEMENT: When the Contractor has an enrolled woman who delivers
during a prospective enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a
supplemental payment. Supplemental payments will not apply to women who deliver
in a prior period coverage time period. AHCCCSA reserves the right at any time
during the term of this contract to adjust the amount of this payment for women
who deliver at home. The delivery supplemental payment is not made if the
hospitalized supplemental payment has already been paid.

HOSPITALIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT: If an MED member is an inpatient on the date
of application for AHCCCS eligibility, and the date of application falls within
the member's eligibility period, the Contractor is entitled to a supplemental
payment to help defray costs related to the inpatient stay. The payment is a
one-time supplement that is paid when the member is enrolled with the Contractor
and is subject to review during the term of the contract.

HIV-AIDS SUPPLEMENT: On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall submit to
AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, an unduplicated monthly count of members, by
rate code, who are using approved HIV/AIDS drugs along with the supporting
pharmacy log. The report shall be submitted, along with the quarterly financial
reporting package, within 60 days after the end of each quarter. AHCCCSA
reserves the right to recoup any amounts paid for ineligible members as well as
an associated penalty for incorrect encounter reporting.

Refer to the AHCCCS, Office of Managed Care HIV/AIDS Supplemental Payment and
Review Policy for further details and requirements.

54. PAYMENTS TO CONTRACTORS

Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments to the
Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contract provided that the
Contractor's performance is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
contract. Payment must comply with requirements of A.R.S. Title 36. AHCCCSA
reserves the option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or National
Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) transfer and will provide the
Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the effective date of any such
change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA shall not be
liable for any error or delay in transfer or indirect or consequential damages
arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or
expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by
the Contractor. Except for adjustments made to correct errors in payment, and as
otherwise specified in this section, any savings remaining to the Contractor as
a result of favorable claims experience and efficiencies in service delivery at
the end of the contract term may be kept by the Contractor.

All funds received by the Contractor pursuant to this contract shall be
separately accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Except for funds received from the collection of permitted copayments and
third-party liabilities, the only source of payment to the Contractor for the

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Contractor will be subject to adjustment or repayment by the Contractor making a
corresponding decrease in a current Contractor's payment or by making an
additional payment by AHCCCSA to the Contractor.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned or pledged by the
Contractor. This section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole option from
making payment to a fiscal agent hired by Contractor.

55. CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS

Except for changes made specifically in accordance with this contract, the rates
set forth in Section B shall not be subject to re-negotiation or modification
during the contract period. AHCCCSA may, at its option, review the effect of a
program change and determine if a capitation adjustment is needed. In these
instances the adjustment will be prospective with assumptions discussed with the
Contractor prior to modifying capitation rates. The Contractor may request a
review of a program change if it believes the program change was not equitable;
AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a review.

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance of any
obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option and in addition to
other available remedies, adjust the amount of payment until there is
satisfactory resolution of the default. The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA
and/or AHCCCSA may deduct from future monthly capitation for any portion of a
month during which the Contractor was not at risk due to, for example:

a.   death of a member

b.   member's incarceration (not eligible for AHCCCS benefits from the date of
     incarceration)

c.   duplicate capitation to the same Contractor

d.   adjustment based on change in member's contract type

e.   voluntary withdrawal

If a member is enrolled twice with the same Contractor, recoupment will be made
as soon as the double capitation is identified. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
modify its policy on capitation recoupments at any time during the term of this
contract.

56. INCENTIVES

AHCCCSA will be implementing an incentive program that utilizes financial and/or
non-financial incentives to promote program quality. AHCCCSA will use contractor
clinical performance indicators in the development of an incentive program.
Examples of incentive programs are listed below.

AUTO ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM: Effective CYE '06, AHCCCSA will adjust the auto
assignment algorithm methodology to incorporate contractor's clinical
performance indicator results in the calculation of target percentages. AHCCCSA
will use the following performance indicators:

         Prenatal Care in the First Trimester
         Well-Child Visits 3-6 Years

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Effective CYE '06, AHCCCSA may elect to reduce
Operational Financial Review (OFR) requirements for high performing contractors.

USE OF WEBSITE: Contractors will be required to post their clinical performance
indicators compared to AHCCCS standard and statewide averages on their website.
In addition, AHCCCSA will post contractor performance indicators on its website.

                                                                  Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

INCENTIVE FUND: AHCCCSA may retain a specified percentage of capitation
reimbursement in order to distribute to Contractors based on their performance
measure outcomes. The incentive fund will not be implemented in CYE '04 and
contractors will be notified at least 60 days prior to implementation in a
future contract year.

57. REINSURANCE

Reinsurance is a stop-loss program provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the
partial reimbursement of covered services, as described below, for a member with
an acute medical condition beyond an annual deductible level. AHCCCSA
"self-insures" the reinsurance program through a deduction to capitation rates
that is intended to be budget neutral. Refer to the AHCCCSA Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual for further details on the Reinsurance Program.

INPATIENT REINSURANCE

Inpatient reinsurance covers partial reimbursement of covered inpatient facility
medical services. See the table below for applicable deductible levels and
coinsurance percentages. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA
will reimburse the Contractor for covered inpatient services incurred above the
deductible. The deductible is the responsibility of the Contractor. Per diem
rates paid for nursing facility services provided within 30 days of an acute
hospital stay, including room and board, provided in lieu of hospitalization for
up to 90 days in any contract year shall be eligible for reinsurance coverage.

The following table represents anticipated deductible and coinsurance levels for
CYE '04. These deductibles and coinsurance percentages are under review by
actuaries and are subject to change, at the discretion of AHCCCSA, prior to
contract awards. Any change will have a corresponding impact on capitation
rates.

*applies to all members except for Title XIX Waiver Group members

a) PROSPECTIVE REINSURANCE: This coverage applies to prospective enrollment
periods. The deductible level is based on the Contractor's statewide AHCCCS
acute care enrollment (not including SOBRA Family Planning Extension services)
as of October 1st each contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown
in the table above. AHCCCSA will adjust the Contractor's deductible level at the
beginning of a contract year if the Contractor's enrollment changes to the next
enrollment level. A Contractor may not elect a lower deductible. These
deductible levels are subject to change by AHCCCSA during the term of this
contract. Any change will have a corresponding impact on capitation rates.

b) PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE REINSURANCE: Effective October 1, 2003, AHCCCSA will no
longer cover PPC inpatient expenses under the reinsurance program for any
members except Title XIX Waiver Group members. See section c) below for
additional information.

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

c) TITLE XIX WAIVER MEMBERS: A separate reinsurance deductible for the Title XIX
Waiver Group applies for both the prospective and prior period coverage time
periods. There can only be one reinsurance case for prior period and prospective
enrollment.

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE

The reinsurance program includes a special Catastrophic Reinsurance program.
This program encompasses members diagnosed with hemophilia, von Willebrand's
Disease, and Gaucher's Disease. For additional detail and restrictions refer to
the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual and the AMPM. There are no
deductibles for catastrophic reinsurance cases. All medically necessary covered
services provided during the contract year shall be eligible for reimbursement
at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount. All catastrophic claims are subject to
medical review by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, Reinsurance Unit,
of cases identified for catastrophic reinsurance coverage within 30 days of (a)
initial diagnosis, (b) enrollment with the Contractor, and (c) the beginning of
each contract year. Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid for a maximum 30-day
retroactive period from the date of notification to AHCCCSA. The determination
of whether a case or type of case is catastrophic shall be made by the Director
or designee based on the following criteria; 1) severity of medical condition,
including prognosis; and 2) the average cost or average length of
hospitalization and medical care, or both, in Arizona, for the type of case
under consideration.

HEMOPHILIA: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all members
diagnosed with Hemophilia (ICD9 codes 286.0, 286.1, 286.2).

VON WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all
members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDAVP responders and
dependent on Plasma Factor VIII.

GAUCHER'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance is available for members diagnosed
with Gaucher's Disease classified as Type I and are dependent on enzyme
replacement therapy.

TRANSPLANTS

This program covers members who are eligible to receive covered major organ and
tissue transplantation including bone marrow, heart, heart/lung, lung, liver,
kidney, and other organ transplantation. Bone grafts and cornea transplantation
services are not eligible for transplant reinsurance coverage but are eligible
under the regular inpatient reinsurance program. Refer to the AMPM for covered
services for organ and tissue transplants. Reinsurance coverage for transplants
is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the transplantation services
rendered, or 85% of the Contractor's paid amount, whichever is lower. The AHCCCS
contracted transplantation rates may be found in the Bidder's Library. When a
member is referred to a transplant facility for an AHCCCS-covered organ
transplant, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management.

OTHER

For all reinsurance case types other than transplants, Contractors will be
reimbursed 100% for all medically necessary covered expenses provided in a
contract year, after the reinsurance case reaches $650,000. Transplant case
types have another risk limitation methodology described in the AHCCCSA
Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION AND PAYMENTS FOR REINSURANCE

a) ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION: A Contractor shall prepare, review, verify, certify,
and submit, encounters for consideration to AHCCCSA. Upon submission, the
Contractor certifies that the services listed were actually rendered. The
encounters must be submitted in the format prescribed by AHCCCSA. The Contractor
must initiate and evaluate an encounter for probable 1st and 3rd party liability
before submitting the encounter for reinsurance consideration, unless the
encounter involves underinsured or uninsured motorist liability insurance, 1st
and 3rd party liability insurance or a tort feasor.

The Contractor must maintain evidence that costs incurred have been paid by the
Contractor before submitting reinsurance encounters. This information is subject
to AHCCCSA review. Collections from 1st and 3rd parties should be reflected by
the Contractor as reductions in the encounters submitted on a dollar-for-dollar
basis. For purposes of AHCCCSA reinsurance, payments made by
Contractor-purchased reinsurance are not considered 1st and 3rd party
collections.

All reinsurance claims must reach a clean claim status within fifteen months
from the end date of service, or date of eligibility posting, whichever is
later.

b) ENCOUNTER PROCESSING: AHCCCSA will accept for processing only those
encounters that are submitted directly by an AHCCCS Contractor and that comply
with the AHCCCSA Encounter Reporting User Manual.

c) PAYMENT OF INPATIENT AND CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE CASES: AHCCCSA will
reimburse a Contractor for costs incurred in excess of the applicable deductible
level, subject to coinsurance percentages. Amounts in excess of the deductible
level shall be paid based upon costs paid by the Contractor, minus the
coinsurance unless the costs are paid under a subcapitated arrangement. In
subcapitated arrangements, the Administration shall base reimbursement of
reinsurance encounters on the lower of the AHCCCS allowed amount or the reported
health plan paid amount, minus the coinsurance and Medicare/TPL payment and
applicable quick pay discounts.

Reimbursement for these reinsurance benefits will be made to the Contractor each
month. AHCCCSA will also provide a reconciliation of reinsurance payments in the
case where encounters used in the calculation of reinsurance benefits are
subsequently adjusted or voided.

When a member with an annual enrollment choice changes Contractors within a
contract year, for reinsurance purposes, all eligible inpatient costs, nursing
facility costs and inpatient psychiatric costs incurred for that member will
follow the member to the receiving health plan. Therefore, all submitted
encounters from the health plan the member is leaving (for dates of service
within the current contract year) will be applied toward, but not exceed, the
receiving health plan's deductible level. For further details regarding this
policy and other reinsurance policies refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual.

d) PAYMENT OF TRANSPLANT REINSURANCE CASES: Reinsurance benefits are based upon
the lower of the AHCCCS contract amount or the Contractor's paid amount, subject
to coinsurance percentages. While encounter data is not currently used to
determine reinsurance payments for transplant services, in the future,
encounters may be required in order for Contractors to receive reinsurance
payments for transplants. Contractors are required to encounter all medical
services provided for which a financial liability is incurred. Please refer to
the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual for the appropriate billing of
transplant services. Reimbursement for these reinsurance benefits will be made
to the Contractor each month.

REINSURANCE AUDITS

PRE-AUDIT: Medical audits on prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance
cases will be determined based on statistically valid retrospective random
sampling. For closed contracts, a 100% audit will be conducted. AHCCCSA, Office
of Managed Care, Reinsurance Unit, will generate the sampling and will notify
the Contractor of documentation needed for the retrospective medical audit
process to occur at the Contractor's offices.

ON-SITE AUDIT: AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least 45 days advance notice
of any on-site audit. The Contractor shall have all requested medical records
and financial documentation on-site and available to the nurse auditors. Any
documents not requested in advance by AHCCCSA shall be made available upon
request of the Audit Team during the course of the audit. The Contractor
representative shall be available to the Audit Team at all times during AHCCCSA
on-site audit activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Audit
Team with workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences.

AUDIT CONSIDERATIONS: Reinsurance consideration will be given to inpatient
facility contracts and hearing decisions rendered by the Office of Legal
Assistance. Pre-hearing and/or hearing penalties discoverable during the review
process will not be reimbursed under reinsurance.

Per diem rates may be paid for nursing facility and rehabilitation services
provided the services are rendered within 30 days of an acute hospital stay,
including room and board, provided in lieu of hospitalization for up to 90 days
in any contract year. The services rendered in these sub-acute settings must be
of an acute nature and, in the case of rehabilitative or restorative services,
steady progress must be documented in the medical record.

AUDIT DETERMINATIONS: The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Reinsurance
Post-Audit Results letter approximately 60 days after the onsite audit and given
an opportunity to comment and provide additional medical or financial
documentation on any audit findings. AHCCCSA may limit reinsurance reimbursement
to a lower or alternative level of care if the Director or designee determines
that the less costly alternative could and should have been used by the
Contractor. A recoupment of reinsurance reimbursements made to the Contractor
may occur based on the results of the medical audit sampling. The results of the
medical audit sampling may be separately extrapolated to the entire prospective
and prior period coverage reinsurance reimbursement populations in the audit
timeframe for the Contractor.

A Contractor whose reinsurance case is reduced or denied shall be notified in
writing by AHCCCSA and will be informed of rationale for reduction or denial
determination and the applicable grievance and appeal process available.

58. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS / THIRD PARTY LIABILITY

By law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort. This means AHCCCSA shall be used as
a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of payment
have been exhausted. The two methods used in the coordination of benefits are
cost avoidance and post payment recovery. The Contractor shall use these methods
as described in A.A.C. R9-22-1001. (See also Section D, Paragraph 60, Medicare
Services and Cost Sharing).

COST AVOIDANCE: The Contractor shall cost-avoid all claims or services that are
subject to third-party payment and may deny a service to a member if it knows
that a third party (i.e. other insurer) will provide the service. However, if a
third-party insurer (other than Medicare) requires the member to pay any
copayment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is responsible for making
these payments, even if the services are provided outside of the Contractor's
network. The Contractor's liability for copayments, coinsurance and deductibles
is limited to what the Contractor would have paid for the entire service
pursuant to a written contract with the provider or the AHCCCS fee-for-service
rate, less any amount paid by the third party. (The

                                                                  Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Contractor must decide whether it is more cost-effective to provide the service
within its network or pay coinsurance and deductibles for a service outside its
network. For continuity of care, the Contractor may also choose to provide the
service within its network.) If the Contractor refers the member for services to
a third-party insurer (other than Medicare), and the insurer requires payment
in advance of all copayments, coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must
make such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will neither pay for nor
provide the covered service, and the service is medically necessary, the
Contractor shall not deny the service nor require a written denial letter. If
the Contractor does not know whether a particular service is covered by the
third party, and the service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall
contact the third party and determine whether or not such service is covered
rather than requiring the member to do so.

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered services. For
prenatal care and preventive pediatric services, AHCCCS may require the
Contractor to provide such service and then coordinate payment with the
potentially liable third party ("pay and chase"). In emergencies, the Contractor
shall provide the necessary services and then coordinate payment with the
third-party payer. The Contractor shall also provide medically necessary
transportation so the member can receive third-party benefits. Further, if a
service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall ensure that its cost
avoidance efforts do not prevent a member from receiving such service and that
the member shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles for use
of the other insurer's providers.

POSTPAYMENT RECOVERIES: Postpayment recovery is necessary in cases where the
Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost-avoid. The Contractor shall identify
all potentially liable third parties and pursue reimbursement from them except
in the circumstances below. The Contractor shall not pursue reimbursement in the
following circumstances unless the case has been referred to the Contractor by
AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA's authorized representative:

Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance              Restitution Recovery
First-and third-party liability insurance              Worker's Compensation
Tortfeasors, including casualty                        Estate recovery
Special Treatment Trusts recovery

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above circumstances to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the Contractor identify such a
situation. See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-1002 and R9-31-1002. The Contractor shall
cooperate with AHCCCSA's authorized representative in all collection efforts. In
joint cases involving both AHCCCS fee-for-service or reinsurance and the
Contractor, AHCCCSA's authorized representative is responsible for performing
all research, investigation and payment of lien-related costs, subsequent to the
referral of any and all relevant case information to AHCCCSA's authorized
representative by the Contractor. AHCCCSA's authorized representative is also
responsible for negotiating and acting in the best interest of all parties to
obtain a reasonable settlement in joint cases and may compromise a settlement in
order to maximize overall reimbursement, net of legal and other costs. The
Contractor will be responsible for their prorated share of the contingency fee.
The Contractor's share of the contingency fee will be deducted from the
settlement proceeds prior to AHCCCSA remitting the settlement to the Contractor.
For total plan cases involving only payments from the Contractor, the Contractor
is responsible for performing all research, investigation, the filing of liens
and payment of lien filing fees and other related costs. The Contractor shall
use the cover sheet as prescribed by AHCCCS when filing liens.

The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party collections if all of
the following conditions exist:

a.   Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the
     Contractor's financial liability for the member

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

     reinsurance or administrative costs (i.e. lien filing and contingency fees,
     etc.)

c.   Such recovery is not prohibited by State or Federal law

REPORTING: The Contractor may be required to report case level detail of
third-party collections and cost avoidance, including number of referrals on
total plan cases. In addition, upon AHCCCSA's request, the Contractor shall
provide an electronic extract of the Casualty cases, including open and closed
cases. Data elements include, but are not limited to: the member's first and
last name; AHCCCS ID; date of incident; claimed amount; paid/recovered amount;
and case status. The AHCCCSA TPL Section shall provide the format and reporting
schedule for this information to the Contractor. The Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA's authorized representative within five working days of the
identification of a third-party liability case with reinsurance. Failure to
report reinsurance cases may result in one of the remedies specified in Section
D, Paragraph 72, Sanctions. The Contractor shall communicate any known change in
health insurance information, including Medicare, to AHCCCS Administration,
Division of Member Services, not later than 10 days from the date of discovery
using the AHCCCS Third-Party Coverage Form found in the Bidder's Library.

AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, on an agreed upon schedule, with a complete
file of all third-party coverage information (other than Medicare) for the
purpose of updating the Contractor's files. The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA
of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format prescribed by
AHCCCSA.

TITLE XXI (KIDSCARE), HIFA PARENTS AND BCCTP: Eligibility for KidsCare, HIFA
Parents and BCCTP benefits require that the applicant/member not be enrolled
with any other creditable health insurance plan. If the Contractor becomes aware
of any such coverage, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA immediately. AHCCCSA
will determine if the other insurance meets the creditable definition in A.R.S.
36-2982(G).

CONTRACT TERMINATION: Upon termination of this contract, the Contractor will
complete the existing third party liability cases or make any necessary
arrangements to transfer the cases to AHCCCSA's authorized TPL representative.

59. COPAYMENTS

The Contractor is responsible for the collection of copayments from members in
accordance with AHCCCS Rules R9-22-711 and R9-31-711, and 42 CFR 447. Services
may not be denied for inability to pay the copayment. Any required copayments
collected shall belong to the Contractor or its subcontractors.

The Contractor may not collect copayments for the following services:

     a.   Prenatal care including all obstetrical visits;

     b.   Well-baby and EPSDT care;

     c.   Care in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the
          mentally retarded;

     d.   Visits scheduled by a primary care physician or practitioner, and not
          at the request of a member;

     e.   Drugs and medications;

     f.   Family planning services;

     g.   Translation and interpreter services.

A provider shall not bill a member for more than the statutory copayment amount.
Refer to Section D, Paragraphs 58, Coordination of Benefits/Third Party

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

60. MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING

AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.
These members are referred to as "dual eligibles". Generally, Contractors are
responsible for payment of Medicare coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered
services provided to dual eligible members. However, there are different cost
sharing responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a variety
of factors. Unless prior approval is obtained from AHCCCSA, the Contractor must
limit their cost sharing responsibility according to the AHCCCS Medicare Cost
Sharing Policy. The Contractor shall have no cost sharing obligation if the
Medicare payment exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same
service of a non-Medicare member.

61. MARKETING

The Contractor shall submit all proposed marketing and outreach materials and
events that will involve the general public to the AHCCCS Marketing Committee
for prior approval in accordance with the AHCCCS Health Plan Marketing Policy.
The Contractor must have signed contracts with PCPs, specialists, dentists, and
pharmacies in order for them to be included in marketing materials.

62. CORPORATE COMPLIANCE

In accordance with A.R.S. Section 36-2918.01, all contractors are required to
notify the AHCCCS, Office of Program Integrity immediately of all suspected
fraud or abuse. The Contractor agrees to promptly (within ten working days of
discovery) inform the Office of Program Integrity in writing of instances of
suspected fraud or abuse. This shall include acts of suspected fraud or abuse
that were resolved internally but involved AHCCCS funds, contractors or
sub-contractors.

As stated in A.R.S. Section 13-2310, incorporated herein by reference, any
person who knowingly obtains any benefit by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, promises, or material omissions is guilty of a Class
2 felony.

The Contractor agrees to permit and cooperate with any onsite review. A review
by the AHCCCS, Office of Program Integrity may be conducted without notice and
for the purpose of ensuring program compliance.

Effective October 1, 2003, the Contractor shall be in compliance with 42 CFR
438.608. The Contractor must have a mandatory compliance program, supported by
other administrative procedures, that is designed to guard against fraud and
abuse.

The compliance program, which shall both prevent and detect suspected fraud or
abuse, must include:

     1.   Written policies, procedures, and standards of conduct that articulate
          the organization's commitment to and processes for complying with all
          applicable federal and state standards.

     2.   The designation of a compliance officer and a compliance committee.

     3.   Effective training and education.

     4.   Effective lines of communication between the compliance officer and
          the organization's employees.

     5.   Enforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary
          guidelines.

     6.   Provision for internal monitoring and auditing.

     7.   Provision for prompt response to problems detected.

The Contractor is required to research potential overpayments identified by the
AHCCCS, Office of Program Integrity. After conducting a cost benefit analysis to
determine if such action is warranted, the Contractor

                                                                  Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

should attempt to recover any overpayments identified. The AHCCCS Office of
Program Integrity shall be advised of the final disposition of the research and
advised of actions, if any, taken by the Contractor.

63. RECORDS RETENTION

The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to covered services and
expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA and working papers used in the
preparation of reports to AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall comply with all
specifications for record keeping established by AHCCCSA. All books and records
shall be maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS Rules
and policies. Records shall include but not be limited to financial statements,
records relating to the quality of care, medical records, prescription files and
other records specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available, at all reasonable times during the term
of this contract, any of its records for inspection, audit or reproduction by
any authorized representative of AHCCCSA, State or Federal government. The
Contractor shall be responsible for any costs associated with the reproduction
of requested information.

The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for a period of
five years from the date of final payment under this contract.

If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records relating to
the work terminated shall be preserved and made available for a period of five
years from the date of any such termination. Records which relate to grievances,
disputes, litigation or the settlement of claims arising out of the performance
of this contract, or costs and expenses of this contract to which exception has
been taken by AHCCCSA, shall be retained by the Contractor for a period of five
years after the date of final disposition or resolution thereof.

64. DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA relating to the
information requirements of this contract and as required to support the data
elements to be provided AHCCCSA in the formats prescribed by AHCCCSA and in
formats prescribed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA). Details for the formats may be found in the draft HIPAA Transaction
Companion Documents & Trading Partner Agreements, and in the AHCCCS Technical
Interface Guidelines, available in the Bidder's Library.

The information so recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance with
all procedures, policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the term of this
contract. If any of these procedures, policies, rules, regulations or statutes
are hereinafter changed both parties agree to conform to these changes following
appropriate notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed submission or
payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors), and/or penalty applied due to
any error, omission, deletion, or erroneous insert caused by
Contractor-submitted data. Any data that does not meet the standards required by
AHCCCSA shall not be accepted by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies immediately
upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA. If any unreported inconsistencies are
subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall be responsible for the necessary
adjustments to correct its records at its own expense.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

<PAGE>

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of eligibility and
enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange. Upon request by
AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP
assignments in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange.

The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific security code for
use in all data transmissions made in accordance with contract requirements.
Each data transmission by the Contractor shall include the Contractor's security
code. The Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it certifies that
any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best of the Contractor's
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or designee's knowledge. The
Contractor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the State of Arizona
and AHCCCSA from any and all claims or liabilities, including but not limited to
consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings and reimbursements
of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any error, omission, deletion or
erroneous insert caused by the Contractor in the submitted input data. Neither
the State of Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be responsible for any incorrect or
delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS services providers (subcontractors)
resulting from such error, omission, deletion, or erroneous input data caused by
the Contractor in the submission of AHCCCS claims.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative costs paid to the
Contractor. There is no separate payment for software changes. A PMMIS systems
contact will be assigned after contract award. AHCCCSA will work with the health
plans as they evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.

HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA): The Contractor
shall comply with the Administrative Simplification requirements of Subpart F of
the HIPAA of 1996 (Public Law 107-191, 110 Statutes 1936) and all Federal
regulations implementing that Subpart that are applicable to the operations of
the Contractor by the dates required by the implementing Federal regulations.

65. ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success of
the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA uses encounter data to pay reinsurance benefits, set
fee-for-service and capitation rates, determine disproportionate share payments
to hospitals, and to determine compliance with performance standards. The
Contractor shall submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all services rendered,
including services provided during prior period coverage. This requirement is a
condition of the CMS grant award.

A Contractor shall prepare, review, verify, certify, and submit, encounters for
consideration to AHCCCSA. Upon submission, the Contractor certifies that the
services listed were actually rendered. The encounters must be submitted in the
format prescribed by AHCCCSA.

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media and must be
submitted in the PMMIS AHCCCSA supplied formats. Specific requirements for
encounter data are described in the AHCCCSA Encounter Reporting User Manual, a
copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library. The Encounter Submission
Requirements are included herein as Attachment I. Refer to Paragraph 64, Data
Exchange Requirements, for further information.

An Encounter Submission Tracking Report must be maintained and made available to
AHCCCSA upon request. The Tracking Report's purpose is to link each claim to an
adjudicated or pended encounter returned to the Contractor. Further information
regarding the Encounter Submission Tracking Report may be found in The AHCCCSA
Encounter Reporting User's Manual.

Each month AHCCCSA provides the Contractor with full replacement files
containing provider and medical procedure coding information. These files should
be used to assist the Contractor in accurate Encounter Reporting. Refer to
Paragraph 64, Data Exchange Requirements, for further information.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

66.  ENROLLMENT AND CAPITATION TRANSACTION UPDATES

AHCCCSA produces daily enrollment transaction updates identifying new members
and changes to members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data, which the
Contractor shall use to update its member records. The daily enrollment
transaction update, which is run prior to the monthly enrollment and capitation
transaction update, is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate
code changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments and
disenrollments.

AHCCCSA also produces a daily Manual Payment Transaction, which identifies
enrollment or disenrollment activity that was not included on the daily
enrollment transaction update due to internal edits. The Contractor shall use
the Manual Payment Transaction in addition to the daily enrollment transaction
update to update its member records.

A weekly capitation transaction will be produced to provide contractors with
member-level capitation payment information. This file will show changes to the
prospective capitation payments, as sent in the monthly file, resulting from
enrollment changes that occur after the monthly file is produced. This file will
also identify mass adjustments to and/or manual capitation payments that
occurred at AHCCCS after the monthly file is produced.

The monthly enrollment and monthly capitation transaction updates are generally
produced two days before the end of every month. The update will identify the
total active population for the Contractor as of the first day of the next
month. These updates contain the information used by AHCCCSA to produce the
monthly capitation payment for the next month. The Contractor will reconcile
their member files with the AHCCCS monthly update.

After reconciling the monthly update information, the Contractor resumes
posting daily updates beginning with the last two days of the month. The last
two daily updates are different from the regular daily updates in that they pay
and/or recoup capitation into the next month. If the Contractor detects an error
through the monthly update process, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office
of Managed Care.

Refer to Paragraph 64, Data Exchange Requirements, for further information.

67. PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS

AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its CMS grant award, requires
periodic reports, encounter data, and other information from the Contractor. The
submission of late, inaccurate, or otherwise incomplete reports shall constitute
failure to report subject to the penalty provisions described in this contract.

Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports are as follows:

         a.  Timeliness: Reports or other required data shall be received on or
             before scheduled due dates.

         b.  Accuracy: Reports or other required data shall be prepared in
             strict conformity with appropriate authoritative sources and/or
             AHCCCS defined standards.

         c.  Completeness: All required information shall be fully disclosed in
             a manner that is both responsive and pertinent to report intent
             with no material omissions.

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and frequency of
submission of reports are subject to change at any time during the term of the
contract. The Contractor shall comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting beyond the term of
the contract. For example, processing claims and reporting encounter data will
likely continue beyond the term of the contract because of lag time in filing
source documents by subcontractors.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting requirements contained
in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health Care Contractors with the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's
Library. The required reports, which are subject to change during the contract
term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report Requirements.

68. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract, request financial or
other information from the Contractor. Upon receipt of such requests for
information, the Contractor shall provide complete information as requested no
later than 30 days after the receipt of the request unless otherwise specified
in the request itself.

69. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the dissemination of
information prepared by AHCCCSA or the Federal government to its members. The
cost of such dissemination shall be borne by the Contractor. All advertisements,
publications and printed materials that are produced by the Contractor and refer
to covered services shall state that such services are funded under contract
with AHCCCSA.

70. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS

AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews on all
successful offerors and will, subject to the availability of resources, provide
technical assistance as appropriate. The Readiness Reviews will be conducted
prior to the start of business. The purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess
new Contractors' readiness and ability to provide covered services to members at
the start of the contract year and current Contractors' readiness to expand to
new geographic service areas. A new Contractor will be permitted to commence
operations only if the Readiness Review factors are met to AHCCCSA's
satisfaction.

71. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

In accordance with CMS requirements, AHCCCSA, or an independent external agent,
will conduct annual Operational and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but
not limited to) ensuring operational and financial program compliance. The
reviews will identify areas where improvements can be made and make
recommendations accordingly, monitor the Contractor's progress towards
implementing mandated programs and provide the Contractor with technical
assistance if necessary. The Contractor shall comply with all other medical
audit provisions as required by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-521 and R9-31-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review will be solely at
the discretion of AHCCCSA. Except in cases where advance notice is not possible
or advance notice may render the review less useful, AHCCCSA will give the
Contractor at least three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site
review. In preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews, the
Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AHCCCSA Review Team by
forwarding in advance such policies, procedures, job descriptions, contracts,
logs and other information that AHCCCSA may request. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents, not requested in advance
by AHCCCSA, shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor personnel, as identified in advance, shall
be available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review
activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with
workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences. Certain documentation submission requirements may be waived at the
discretion of AHCCCSA, if the Contractor has obtained accreditation from NCQA,
JCAHO or any other

                                                                Acute Care RFP

nationally recognized accrediting body. The Contractor must submit the entire
accreditation report to AHCCCSA for such waiver consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a draft copy of the Operational and Financial
Review Report and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings prior
to AHCCCSA publishing the final report. Operational and Financial Review
findings may be used in the scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that
Contractor. Recommendations, made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor
into compliance with Federal, State, AHCCCS, and/or RFP requirements, must be
implemented by the Contractor. AHCCCSA may conduct a follow- up Operational and
Financial Review to determine the Contractor's progress in implementing
recommendations and achieving program compliance. Follow-up reviews may be
conducted at any time after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the event the
Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change in ownership or makes
changes in three or more key staff positions within a 12-month period.

72. SANCTIONS

AHCCCSA may impose monetary sanctions, suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or
terminate this contract or any related subcontracts in accordance with AHCCCS
Rules R9-22-606 and the terms of this contract and applicable Federal or State
law and regulations. Written notice will be provided to the Contractor
specifying the sanction to be imposed, the grounds for such sanction and either
the length of suspension or the amount of capitation prepayment to be withheld.
The Contractor may appeal the decision to impose a sanction in accordance with
A.A.C. 22, Article 8. Intermediate sanctions may be imposed, but are not limited
to the following actions:

e.   Suspension of payment for recipients enrolled after the effective date of
     the sanction until CMS or AHCCCSA is satisfied that the reason for
     imposition of the sanction no longer exists and is not likely to recur.

f.   Additional sanctions allowed under statue or regulation that address areas
     of noncompliance, such as termination of the contract.

CURE NOTICE PROCESS: Prior to the imposition of a sanction for non-compliance,
AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the Contractor regarding the
details of the non-compliance. The cure notice will specify the period of time
during which the Contractor must bring its performance back into compliance with
contract requirements. If, at the end of the specified time period, the
Contractor has complied with the cure notice requirements, AHCCCSA will take no
further action. If, however, the Contractor has not complied with the cure
notice requirements, AHCCCSA will proceed with the imposition of sanctions.

The Sanctions policy is currently being drafted and will be in the Bidders
Library when finalized.

73. BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN

The Contractor shall adhere to all elements of the AHCCCS, Office of Managed
Care Business Continuity Plan Policy. This plan is currently under review and

75. PENDING LEGISLATIVE / OTHER ISSUES

The following constitute pending items that will be resolved after the initial
issuance of the RFP document. Any program changes due to the resolution of the
issues will be reflected in future amendments to the RFP. Final awarded
capitation rates may also be adjusted to reflect the financial impact of program
changes.

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS: The Governor of Arizona issued an Executive Order, available
on the AHCCCS website, requiring AHCCCSA to explore carving out the prescription
drug benefit from capitation in order to participate in the Federal Drug Rebate
Program. As a result, the Contractor is required to submit two capitation rate
proposals, one with and one without prescription drug costs and utilization.
Refer to the Section C, Definitions and Section I, Instructions to Offerors, for
more detail.

HOSPITAL REIMBURSEMENT PILOT PROGRAM: Legislation to extend the Pilot program
may be introduced effective for contract years beginning CYE '04. See Paragraph
40, Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement, for additional information on the
Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program. The Pilot program is scheduled to
terminate September 30, 2003.

HOSPICE SERVICES FOR MEMBERS AGE 21 AND OLDER: AHCCCSA is considering adding
hospice services as a benefit for members age 21 and older and is undergoing the
approval process, which includes an amendment to AHCCCS' state plan with CMS.

TRANSPLANT CONTRACTS: AHCCCSA is currently negotiating new contracts for organ
and tissue transplants, to be effective October 1, 2003. Contracted rates will
be published as soon as they are finalized.

TRANSPLANTS: AHCCCSA may evaluate carving out transplant services from the
compendium of services for which AHCCCS Contractors are responsible. If AHCCCSA
determines that carving out the responsibility for transplant services is
appropriate, an RFP will be issued for the program. AHCCCSA does not anticipate
a carve out in CYE '04.

TRANSPORTATION: AHCCCSA is evaluating its methodology, under capitation, for
providing transportation services to its members. Options may include
contracting with a centralized transportation broker to provide services to all
AHCCCS members. AHCCCSA does not anticipate a carve out in CYE '04.

MEMBER COST SHARING: AHCCCSA submitted a report to the Arizona Legislature on
possibilities for increasing AHCCCS' member cost sharing responsibilities. This
report may be found on the AHCCCS website. Changes include increases to
copayment amounts and collection of premiums. AHCCCSA is seeking CMS approval to
expand member cost sharing responsibility. Refer to the AHCCCS website for a
copy of the Cost Sharing Report.

76. BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997 (BBA)

In August of 2002, CMS issued final regulations for the implementation of the
BBA. AHCCCS is currently reviewing all areas of the regulations to ensure full
compliance with the BBA; however, there are some issues that require further
clarification from CMS. The following items related to the BBA regulations are
pending. Any program changes due to the resolution of the issues will be
reflected in amendments to the RFP. Final awarded capitation rates may be also
be adjusted to reflect the financial impact of the program changes.

GRIEVANCES: AHCCCSA has not reached a final decision on whether it will
implement the option for a member to request an expedited hearing directly from
AHCCCSA. The final decision will be communicated through a future amendment to
this RFP.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                  CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS: AHCCCSA is in the process of determining the impact of
the BBA regulations regarding individuals with special healthcare needs. The
AMPM will be expanded to address policies related to this population.

PPC TIME PERIOD FOR MED POPULATION: AHCCCSA is determining how to handle
reimbursement to the Contractor for the day a member meets spend down
requirements.

POLICIES: AHCCCSA is currently revising policies, as needed, to reflect the BBA
regulations. As the policies are updated, they will be issued to all offerors
via the AHCCCS web under "Bidder's Library". If a policy is finalized after the
contracts bids are awarded, they will be issued to all Contractors, both via the
website and in hard copy. Examples of AHCCCS policies currently under revision
include the AMPM, Sanctions Policy, Member Information Policy and the Health
Plan Marketing Policy.

77. HEALTHCARE GROUP OF ARIZONA

AHCCCSA encourages all Contractors to participate in the Healthcare Group (HCG)
program. Legislation was passed in 2002 that shifted administrative
responsibilities from HCG contractors to AHCCCSA. Additionally, effective
February 1, 2003, HCG's service package and premium structure has been
redesigned to better reflect the small group product in the Arizona marketplace.
HCG has created a niche market, as insurance companies are moving away from the
Health Maintenance Organization market. HCG hopes to expand its enrollment
significantly during the next two years, which will result in a solid membership
base to spread risk, thereby increasing the attractiveness of the HCG product.
For additional information, contact AHCCCSA, Office of the Director.

contract or failure to take corrective action as required by AHCCCSA to comply

more than one contract with AHCCCSA, AHCCCSA may deem unsatisfactory performance
under one contract to be cause to require the Contractor to provide assurance of
performance under any and all other contracts. In such situations, AHCCCSA

EVALUATION FACTORS AND SELECTION PROCESS              CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

SECTION H: EVALUATION FACTORS AND SELECTION PROCESS

AHCCCSA has established a scoring methodology which is designed to evaluate
fairly an offeror's ability to provide cost-effective, high-quality contract
services in a managed care setting in accordance with the AHCCCS overall mission
and goals. The following factors will be evaluated and weighted in the order
listed:

     1.   Provider Network

     2.   Capitation

     3.   Program

     4.   Organization

     5.   Extra Credit (optional)

It is anticipated that Capitation and the network development portion of
Provider Network will be scored by Geographic Service Area. The remaining
submission areas: the network management portion of Provider Network, Program,
Organization and Extra Credit, are anticipated to be scored statewide, not
specific to any Geographic Service Area (GSA). The scores received for each of
the four required components will be weighted separately and combined to derive
a final score for the Offeror, by GSA, prior to adding any extra credit earned.
Contracts will be awarded to qualified offerors whose proposals are deemed to be
most advantageous to the State in accordance with Section I, Paragraph 9, Award
of Contract.

In the case of negligible differences between two or more competing proposals
for a particular GSA, in the best interest of the state, AHCCCSA may consider
the following factors in awarding the contract:

          -    an Offeror who is an incumbent health plan and has performed in
               an adequate manner (in the interest of continuity of care);
               and/or

          -    an Offeror who participates satisfactorily in other lines of
               AHCCCS business; and/or

          -    an Offeror's past performance with AHCCCS.

Offerors are encouraged to submit a bid for more than one GSA and/or for more
than just urban GSAs.

AHCCCSA reserves the right to waive immaterial defects or omissions in this
solicitation or submitted proposals. The Offeror should note that, if
successful, it must meet all AHCCCS requirements, irrespective of what is
requested and evaluated through this solicitation. The proposal provided by the
Offeror will become part of the contract with AHCCCS.

All of the components listed below will be evaluated against relevant statutes,
AHCCCSA rules and policies and the requirements contained in this RFP. The
Offeror's Checklist (Attachment K) contains RFP references for each of these
items:

1.   PROVIDER NETWORK

The provider network will be evaluated and scored with reference to the
Offeror's network development and network management. Network development is
defined as the process of developing contractual arrangements with a sufficient
number of providers capable of delivering all covered services to AHCCCS members
in accordance with AHCCCSA standards (e.g., appointment times). AHCCCSA will use
contracts and/or completed Letters of Intent with other required materials to
evaluate and score network development. A signed Letter of Intent will receive
the same weight and consideration as a signed contract. The Offeror's network
will be evaluated by service and by site in each GSA bid by the Offeror. The
Offeror should note that Attachment B of this solicitation identifies minimum
geographic standards for a provider network.

                                                                Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

<PAGE>

EVALUATION FACTORS AND SELECTION PROCESS              CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Network management is defined as the process by which the Offeror certifies,
monitors, evaluates and communicates with its network. AHCCCSA anticipates
evaluating and scoring the Offeror's submitted materials relative to the
following areas:

     a.   Monitoring and management of network

     b.   Network communication

     c.   Capacity analysis, planning and development

2.   CAPITATION

The Offeror shall submit initial capitation bids by risk group within a GSA.
These initial bids will be evaluated and scored. The lowest bid within each GSA
and risk group will receive the maximum allowable points. If a bid is below the
actuarial rate range, the bid will be evaluated as if it were at the bottom of
the actuarial rate range. No additional points will be given for bids below the
actuarial rate range. Conversely, the highest bid (within or above the actuarial
rate range) will receive the least number of points.

If AHCCCSA requests best and final offers, these offers will be scored using the
same methodology as was used to score the initial bids. The initial bid will be
weighted 60% and the final bid 40%.

Offerors should note that AHCCCSA may not offer the opportunity to submit best
and final offers.

3.   PROGRAM

AHCCCSA will evaluate the Offeror's responsiveness to the requirements of this
solicitation and AHCCCSA policies. In particular, it is anticipated that the
Offeror's proposal regarding the following will be evaluated:

     a.   Quality Management

     b.   Utilization Management

     c.   Disease Prevention/Health Maintenance

     d.   Focused Health Needs

     e.   Member Services

4.   ORGANIZATION

Organization refers to the Offeror's prospective ability to perform the
administrative tasks necessary to support the requirements identified in this
solicitation. It is anticipated that the following areas will be evaluated:

     a.   Organization and Staffing

     b.   Corporate Compliance

     c.   Grievance and Appeals

     d.   Claims (includes TPL)

     e.   Encounters

     f.   Financial Standards (includes Performance Bond)

     g.   Liability Management (IBNR and RBUCs)

5.   EXTRA CREDIT

The Offeror will have the option of submitting, in its proposal, descriptions of
programs/initiatives it has implemented or will implement within the first year
of the contract. These programs/initiatives should be ones that go beyond the
requirements of this RFP. AHCCCSA's purpose in allowing these submissions is to
introduce innovations to improve the AHCCCS program. The programs/initiatives
should fit into one of the following three categories:

                                                                Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

<PAGE>

EVALUATION FACTORS AND SELECTION PROCESS              CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

     a.   Use of Technology

     b.   Reduction of Hassle Factors for Providers

     c.   Community Involvement

The Offeror may submit up to three programs/initiatives, but should be aware
that the total of extra credit points is limited, regardless of the number
submitted. Offeror's should be aware that the points earned through extra credit
responses may be significant enough to determine the outcome of contract awards.

Responses for extra credit will be scored by a group experienced in Medicaid
managed care at the national level.

Submission of these programs/initiatives is optional. If extra credit is
awarded, the proposed programs/initiatives will be included in the successful
Offeror's special terms and conditions to the contract.

sided, single spaced, type written pages. Erasures, interlineations or other
modifications in the proposal must be initialed in original ink by the
authorized person signing the offer. A policy, brochure, or reference to a
policy or manual does not constitute an adequate response. AHCCCSA will not
reimburse the Offeror the cost of proposal preparation.

It is the responsibility of the Offeror to examine the entire RFP, seek
clarification of any requirement that may not be clear, and check all responses
for accuracy before submitting its proposal. The proposal becomes a part of the
contract; thus, what is stated in the proposal may be evaluated either during
the proposal evaluation process or during other reviews. Proposals may not be
withdrawn after the published due date and time.

All proposals will become the property of AHCCCSA. The Offeror may designate
certain information to be proprietary in nature by typing the word "proprietary"
on top of every page for which nondisclosure is requested. Final determinations
of nondisclosure, however, rest with the AHCCCSA Director. Regardless of such
determinations, all portions of the Offeror's proposal, even pages that are
proprietary, will be provided to CMS and its evaluation contractor.

All proposals shall be organized according to the following major categories:

     I.   General Matters

    II.   Provider Network

   III.   Capitation

    IV.   Program

     V.   Organization

    VI.   Extra Credit

Each section shall be separated by a divider and contain all information
requested in this solicitation. Numbering of pages should continue in sequence
through each separate section. For example, "Provider Network" would begin with
the page number following the last page number in "General Matters". Each
section shall begin with a table of contents.

Proposals that are not submitted in conformance with the guidelines described
herein will not be considered. References to various sections of the RFP
document in Section I and Section K are intended to be of assistance and are not
intended to represent all requirements. Other possible resources may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

All responses incorporating examples of past performance and/or outcome data
must comply with the following requirements:

     -    Incumbents must submit based on their AHCCCS acute care line of
          business

     -    New Offerors currently operating as Managed Care Organizations (MCO),
          must submit all historical information from the same MCO/line of
          business

     -    New Offerors without current managed care operations are not expected
          to respond to historical submission requirements.

III. CAPITATION

Capitation is a fixed (per member) monthly payment to contractors for the
provision of covered services to members. It is an actuarially sound amount to
cover expected utilization and costs for the individual risk groups in a
risk-sharing managed care environment. The Offeror must demonstrate that the
capitation rates proposed are actuarially sound. In general terms, this means
that the Offeror who is awarded a contract should be able to keep utilization at
or near its proposed levels and that it will be able to contract for unit costs
that average at or near the amounts shown on the Capitation Rates Calculation
Sheet (CRCS). This requirement also applies to bids submitted in best and final
offer rounds.

Prior Period Coverage (PPC) and HIV/AIDS Supplement rates will be set by AHCCCS'
actuaries and not bid by the Contractor. Due to the lack of complete historical
data, the Title XIX Waiver Group and HIFA Parents' rates will also be set by
AHCCCS' actuaries, rather than bid by the Contractor. See Section D, Paragraph
53, Compensation, for information regarding risk sharing for the Title XIX
Waiver Group and PPC time period. All other rate codes, including the Delivery
Supplemental Payment, will be subject to competitive bidding.

To facilitate the preparation of its capitation proposals, AHCCCSA will provide
each Offeror with a Data Supplement. This data source should not be used as the
sole source of information in making decisions concerning the capitation
proposal. Each Offeror is solely responsible for research, preparation and
documentation of its capitation proposal.

REQUIRED SUBMISSION: CAPITATION

     10.  The Offeror must submit its capitation proposal using the AHCCCSA bid
          web site. Instructions for accessing and using the web site will be
          issued by March 1, 2003. The Offeror must have an actuary who is a
          member of the American Academy of Actuaries certify that the bid
          submission is actuarially sound. This certification must be done with
          subsequent submissions in Best and Final Offer rounds (if applicable).
          The Offeror must also submit hard copy print outs of the web site
          CRCS. Refer to Section B and Attachment E for more details.

          The Offeror must prepare and submit its capitation proposal assuming a
          $35,000 deductible level for regular reinsurance, for all rate codes,
          in all counties. AHCCCSA will provide a table of per member per month
          reinsurance adjustments to be made to capitation rates for those
          Contractors whose actual deductible level exceeds $35,000.

          Capitation rates shall be submitted two ways: first, assuming all
          medical services are included in the capitation rates, and second,
          assuming that prescription drugs will be carved out of the capitation
          rates. Prescription drugs are defined as "FDA approved legend or over
          the counter (OTC) products provided upon receipt of a valid
          prescription order and dispensed by a pharmacist in an outpatient
          setting." When bidding with prescription drugs carved out, please
          factor the impact to the other medical service and administrative
          categories. AHCCCSA anticipates that in the event that prescription
          drugs are carved

                                                                Acute Care RFP

3.       PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS' CONFERENCE AND TECHNICAL INTERFACE MEETING

A New Offerors' Conference will be held on February 21, 2003, from 8:30 a.m.
until 9:30, at AHCCCS' 701 E. Jefferson building in the Gold Room on the 3rd
Floor. The purpose of this conference will be to orient new offerors to AHCCCS.
Continuing offerors are welcome to attend, but the agenda will assume no prior
familiarity with the AHCCCS program. From 10:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., there will
be a Prospective Offerors' conference for all new and continuing offerors. The
purpose of this conference is to clarify the contents of this solicitation and
to avoid any misunderstandings regarding AHCCCSA requirements. Any doubt as to
the contents and requirements of this solicitation or any apparent omission or
discrepancy should be presented at this conference. AHCCCSA will then determine
the action necessary and issue a written amendment to the solicitation, if
appropriate.

Also on February 21, 2003, from 2:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m., a Technical Interface
meeting will be held. The purpose of this meeting is to orient prospective
offerors to the AHCCCS PMMIS system requirements and to answer any technical
questions.

4.       LATE PROPOSALS

Late proposals will not be considered.

5.       WITHDRAWAL OF PROPOSAL

At any time prior to the proposal due date and time, the Offeror (or designated
representative) may withdraw its proposal. Withdrawals must be provided in
writing and submitted to Michael Veit, AHCCCSA, Contracts and Purchasing.

6.       AMENDMENTS TO RFP

Amendments may be issued subsequent to the issue date of this solicitation.
Receipt of solicitation amendments must be acknowledged by signing and returning
the signature page of the amendment to Michael Veit, AHCCCS, Contracts and
Purchasing.

7.       ON-SITE REVIEW

Prior to contract award, all Offerors may be subject to on-site review(s) to
determine that an infrastructure is in place that will support the provision of
services to the acute population within the GSAs bid.

8.       BEST AND FINAL OFFERS

AHCCCSA reserves the right to accept any or all initial offers without further
negotiation and may choose not to request a best and final offer (BFO). Offerors
are therefore advised to submit their most competitive offers at the outset.
However, if it is considered in the best interest of the State, AHCCCSA may
issue a written request to all offerors for a best and final offer in a
particular geographic service area or areas. The purpose of a BFO request is to
allow offerors an opportunity to resubmit bids for rate codes not previously
accepted by AHCCCSA. This request will notify them of the date, time and place
for the submission of their offers. In addition, AHCCCSA will disclose to each
offeror which of its bid rates are acceptable (within or below actuarial rate
range), and which are not acceptable (above the actuarial rate range). All
offerors whose final bid rates fall below the bottom of the actuarial rate range
will have their rates increased to the bottom of that rate range after the final
BFO. If an offeror does not submit a notice of withdrawal or a best and final
offer, its immediate previous offer will be considered its best and final offer.

All BFOs must be submitted via the AHCCCS website, as well as in accordance with
Section B of the RFP. AHCCCSA will limit the number of BFO rounds if it is in
the best interest of the State. Offerors will be

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS                              CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

permitted, within the restrictions and limitations defined below, to adjust
upward, a capitation rate for a rate code that was previously accepted to offset
the reduction of a capitation rate in another rate code in the first BFO round
only. These restrictions and limitations include, but are not limited to:

         a.       An offeror will be allowed to adjust upward a previously
                  accepted rate code bid only during the first BFO round;

         b.       The weighted amount of BFO increase cannot exceed the weighted
                  amount of BFO reduction. AHCCCSA will furnish the Offeror, in
                  the Data Supplement, the enrollment percentages, by rate code,
                  by GSA, to be used in determining the weighted amount. Should
                  the weighted amount of the adjustment exceed the weighted
                  amount of the BFO reduction, AHCCCSA shall reject the first
                  BFO and the adjustment (costing the Offeror the loss of the
                  first BFO round in that GSA). Since a rate code can only be
                  adjusted during the first BFO round, the Offeror will lose the
                  opportunity to make an upward capitation adjustment to
                  previously accepted rate code bids in that GSA.

                  For example, assume that SSI w/o Medicare was the rate code
                  where a BFO was needed and the offeror reduced this rate by
                  $10 PMPM. Also assume the SSI w/o Medicare rate code accounted
                  for 9% of the members in the GSA.

                  Weighted Average Capitation Reduction - 9% X $10.00 = $.90

                  Assume the rate code adjusted upward was TANF and this rate
                  code was increased by $2.00 PMPM. Also assume this rate code
                  accounted for 50% of the members in the GSA.

                  Weighted Average Capitation Increase - 50% X $2.00 = $1.00

                  Therefore, the BFO would be rejected because the weighted
                  amount of the BFO adjustment exceeded the weighted amount of
                  the BFO reduction.

         c.       Offerors will not be allowed to decrease a bid in a BFO round
                  if the initial bid was below the bottom of the rate range. If
                  such a BFO is submitted it will be rejected.

         d.       If an adjustment during the initial BFO round causes the
                  Offeror to exceed the upper range of any rate code, AHCCCSA
                  will reject the adjustment and return the (adjusted) rate code
                  to the initial capitation rate bid by the Offeror. Since a
                  previously accepted rate code bid can only be adjusted during
                  the first BFO round, the Offeror will lose the opportunity to
                  make an upward capitation adjustment for this rate code.

         e.       AHCCCSA reserves the sole right to accept or reject any
                  adjustment. The Offeror by submitting an adjustment to a rate
                  code is requesting approval by AHCCCSA; such approval shall
                  not be automatic. If an initial bid is below the bottom of a
                  rate range, it cannot be adjusted downward by the Offeror in a
                  BFO round.

CAPITATION RATES OFFERED AFTER THE BFOs: As stated above, AHCCCSA may limit the
number of BFO rounds. After the final BFO round is complete, provided it is in
the best interest of the State, AHCCCSA will cease issuing BFO requests. At this
point, should the Offeror have a rate code(s) without an accepted capitation
rate, AHCCCSA shall offer a capitation rate to the Offeror. The capitation rate
offered should be somewhere in the bottom half of the rate range (specific
placement to be determined by AHCCCSA and its actuaries). Note that all rates
offered in this manner shall be identical for all offerors in the same GSA and
rate code.

                                                                Acute Care RFP

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS                              CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

9.       AWARD OF CONTRACT

AHCCCSA has determined that the provision of covered services to eligible
populations in the Geographic Service Areas as described below will stabilize
risk sharing. The Offeror must therefore bid on at least one entire GSA in order
to be considered for a contract award. Although AHCCCSA encourages Offerors to
bid on multiple GSAs, AHCCCSA may limit the number of GSA's awarded to any one
offeror, if deemed in the best interest of the State.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this solicitation, AHCCCSA expressly
reserves the right to:

         a.       Waive any immaterial mistake or informality;

         b.       Reject any or all proposals, or portions thereof; and/or

         c.       Reissue a Request for Proposal

If two plans or their parents merge after obtaining contract awards, AHCCCSA
retains the right to address each merger issue on an individual basis according
to what is deemed in the best interest of the State.

If there are significant compliance issues with a current plan or a plan's
contract in a particular county has been previously terminated, AHCCCSA retains
the right to address each compliance or termination issue on an individual basis
according to what is deemed in the best interest of the State. A new bid
proposal may not be accepted until it has been determined that the reason for
the significant compliance or termination issue has been resolved and there is a
reasonable assurance that it will not recur.

A response to this Request for Proposals is an offer to contract with AHCCCSA
based upon the terms, conditions, scope of work and specifications of the RFP.
All of the terms and conditions of the contract are contained in this
solicitation, solicitation amendments and subsequent contract amendments, if
any, signed by the Contracting Officer. Proposals do not become contracts unless
and until they are accepted by the Contracting Officer. A contract is formed
when the AHCCCSA Contracting Officer signs the award page and provides written
notice of the award(s) to the successful offeror(s), and the Offeror accepts any
special provisions to the contract and the final rates awarded. AHCCCSA may
also, at its sole option, modify any requirements described herein. All offerors
will be promptly notified of award.

AHCCCSA reserves the right to specify and/or modify the number of contracts to
be awarded in any GSA. AHCCCSA anticipates awarding contracts as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
 GSA #:               County or Counties                    Number of Awards:

  6           Yavapai                                         Maximum of 2
  8           Gila, Pinal                                     Maximum of 2
  10          Pima, Santa Cruz*                               Maximum of 5
  12          Maricopa                                        Maximum of 6
  14          Graham, Greenlee, Cochise                       Maximum of 2
</TABLE>

Note: *AHCCCS anticipates awarding up to five contracts in the Pima County
portion of the Pima/Santa Cruz GSA. Contracts will be awarded to two of the five
Pima contract awardees in Santa Cruz.

An existing contractor in Maricopa or Pima County who is not awarded a new
contract may request to have its enrollment capped and to continue providing
services under the terms and condition of this new RFP. AHCCCSA may, at its sole
option, grant or deny such a request. If AHCCCSA approves such an enrollment
cap,

                                                                Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

<PAGE>

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS                              CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

the Contractor would continue to serve its existing members but would not
receive any new members. The enrollment cap will not be lifted during the term
of this or any subsequent contract period unless one of the following conditions
exist:

         a.       Another contractor is terminated and increased member capacity
                  is needed, or

         b.       Legislative action creates a sudden and substantial increase
                  in the overall AHCCCS population, or

         c.       Extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances make such an action
                  necessary and in the best interest of the State.

If an existing contractor is not awarded a new or capped (as mentioned above)
contract, an open enrollment will be held, as described in Section D, Paragraph
5 of this document. The costs of this open enrollment shall be shared by each of
the Contractors within the pertinent GSA and AHCCCSA.

Subsequent to the award of contracts, in the event of significant non-compliance
issues with a Contractor in a particular GSA, AHCCCSA may refer back to the
results of the evaluation of this solicitation and select another Contractor for
a particular GSA that is considered to be in the best interest of the State.

Finally, successful bidders should be prepared to submit sample subcontracts for
approval as soon as possible after the contract award. AHCCCSA will expedite the
approval process.

10.      FEDERAL DEADLINE FOR SIGNING CONTRACT

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has imposed strict deadlines
for finalization of contracts in order to qualify for federal financial
participation. This contract, and all subsequent amendments, must be completed
and signed by both parties, and must be available for submission to CMS prior to
the beginning date for the contract term (October 1, 2003). All public entity
Offerors must ensure that the approval of this contract is placed on appropriate
agendas well in advance to ensure compliance with this deadline. Any withholding
of federal funds caused by the Offeror's failure to comply with this requirement
shall be borne in full by the Offeror.

[The following provisions must be included verbatim in every subcontract.]

1) ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

No payment due the Subcontractor under this subcontract may be assigned without
the prior approval of AHCCCSA. No assignment or delegation of the duties of this
subcontract shall be valid unless prior written approval is received from
AHCCCSA. (AAC R2-7-305)

2) AWARDS OF OTHER SUBCONTRACTS

AHCCCSA and/or the Contractor may undertake or award other contracts for
additional or related work to the work performed by the Subcontractor and the
Subcontractor shall fully cooperate with such other Contractors, subcontractors
or state employees. The Subcontractor shall not commit or permit any act which
will interfere with the performance of work by any other contractor,
subcontractor or state employee. (AAC R2-7-308)

3) CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE - ANTI-KICKBACK AND LABORATORY TESTING

By signing this subcontract, the Subcontractor certifies that it has not engaged
in any violation of the Medicare Anti-Kickback statute (42 USC Sections
1320a-7b) or the "Stark I" and "Stark II" laws governing related-entity
referrals (PL 101-239 and PL 101-432) and compensation there from. If the
Subcontractor provides laboratory testing, it certifies that it has complied
with 42 CFR Section 411.361 and has sent to AHCCCSA simultaneous copies of the
information required by that rule to be sent to the Health Care Financing
Administration. (42 USC Sections 1320a-7b; PL 101-239 and PL 101-432; 42 CFR

4) CERTIFICATION OF TRUTHFULNESS OF REPRESENTATION

By signing this subcontract, the Subcontractor certifies that all
representations set forth herein are true to the best of its knowledge. No

5) CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS OF 1988

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) of 1988 requires
laboratories and other facilities that test human specimens to obtain either a
CLIA Waiver or CLIA Certificate in order to obtain reimbursement from the
Medicare and Medicaid (AHCCCS) programs. In addition, they must meet all the
requirements of 42 CFR 493, Subpart A.

To comply with these requirements, AHCCCSA requires all clinical laboratories to
provide verification of CLIA Licensure or Certificate of Waiver during the
provider registration process. Failure to do so shall result in either a
termination of an active provider ID number or denial of initial registration.
These requirements apply to all clinical laboratories.

Pass-through billing or other similar activities with the intent of avoiding the
above requirements are prohibited. The Contractor may not reimburse providers
who do not comply with the above requirements. (CLIA of 1988; 42 CFR 493,
Subpart A)

6) COMPLIANCE WITH AHCCCSA RULES RELATING TO AUDIT AND INSPECTION

The Subcontractor shall comply with all applicable AHCCCS Rules and Audit Guide
relating to the audit of the Subcontractor's records and the inspection of the
Subcontractor's facilities. If the Subcontractor is an inpatient facility, the
Subcontractor shall file uniform reports and Title XVIII and Title XIX cost
reports with AHCCCSA.

court. If the subcontract is terminated under this section, unless the
Contractor is a governmental agency, instrumentality or subdivision thereof,
AHCCCSA shall be entitled to a penalty, in addition to any other damages to
which it may be entitled by law, and to exemplary damages in the amount of three
times the cost incurred by the Subcontractor in providing any such gratuities to

INSTRUCTIONS:

Contractors shall have in place an adequate network of providers capable of
meeting contract requirements. The information that follows describes the
minimum network requirements by Geographic Service Area (GSA). In some GSAs
there are required service sites located outside of the geographical boundary of
a GSA. The reason for this relates to practical access to care. In certain
instances, a member must travel a much greater distance to receive services
within their assigned GSA, if the member were not allowed to receive services in
an adjoining GSA or state.

Split zip codes occur in some counties. Split zip codes are those which straddle
two different counties. Enrollment for members residing in these zip codes is
based upon the county and GSA to which the entire zip code has been assigned by
AHCCCS. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing services to members
residing in the entire zip code that is assigned to the GSA for which the
Contractor has agreed to provide services. The split zip codes GSA assignments
are as follows:

If outpatient specialty services (OB, family planning, internal medicine and
pediatrics) are not included in the primary care provider contract, at least one
subcontract is required for each of these specialties in the service sites
specified.

In Tucson (GSA 10) and Metropolitan Phoenix (GSA 12), the Contractor must
demonstrate its ability to provide PCP, dental and pharmacy services so that
members do not have to travel more than 5 miles from their residence.
Metropolitan Phoenix is defined on the Minimum Network Standard page specific to
GSA # 12.

ATTACHMENT D (1): SAMPLE LETTER OF INTENT

The following information is provided as early notification for Offerors'
benefit. However, complete instructions regarding this Letter of Intent will be
provided when the RFP is released. Do not send completed Letter of Intent to
AHCCCSA at this time. Only instructions included in the RFP are considered
official.

LETTER OF INTENT INSTRUCTIONS

The following is the mandated format for the Arizona Health Care Cost
Containment System, Contract Year Ending 2004, Letter of Intent (LOI). It is to
be used to show a provider's intention to enter into a contract with an Offeror.
No alterations or changes are permitted, except for shaded areas, which identify
the Offeror. The completed LOI or an executed contract will be acceptable
evidence of an Offeror's proposed network. For purposes of the RFP, no scoring
distinction will be made between an LOI and executed contracts.

If a provider has multiple sites that offer identical services, only one LOI
should be signed, with additional service site information (items 1 to 6)
attached to the LOI. If services differ between sites, a separate LOI must be
obtained for each service site.

If a representative signs an LOI on behalf of a provider, evidence of authority
for the representative must be available upon request.

                                                                  Acute Care RFP

ATTACHMENT E: INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING CAPITATION PROPOSAL

All capitation rate bid proposals (including and best and final offers, if
applicable) must be submitted to AHCCCSA via the AHCCCS Web Based Capitation
Rate Proposal application. A Capitation Rate Calculation Sheet (CRCS) must be
completed for every risk group in each Geographic Service Area (GSA) in which
the Offeror bids.

The Offeror must also use the Web application to print and submit Section B,
Capitation Rates, of the Request for Proposal (RFP). In the event that the Web
application bid submission differs from the bid submission included with Section
B of the RFP, the bid submitted via the Web application will prevail. The first
page of Section B should be the certification that the capitation rates are
actuarially sound by an actuary who is a member of the American Academy of
Actuaries.

The Web application will present the CRCS bid screens by:

       a.    Pharmacy expenditures included and without pharmacy expenditures

       b.    Geographic Service Area (GSA), and

       c.    Risk Group

The following is a list of the seven GSAs and the fifteen counties associated to
each GSA that will be effective 10/1/03.

ATTACHMENT G: AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM               CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

ATTACHMENT G: AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not have the right to choose a Contractor or members who have the
right to choose but do not exercise this right, are assigned to a Contractor
through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a mathematical formula
used to distribute members to the various Contractors in a manner that is
predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals.

The algorithm employs a data table and a formula to assign cases (a case may be
a member or a household of members) to Contractors using the target percentages
developed. The algorithm data table consists of all the geographic service areas
(GSA) in the state, all Contractors serving each GSA, and the target percentages
by risk group within each GSA.

The Contractor farthest away from its target percentage within a GSA and risk
group, the largest negative difference, is assigned the next case for that GSA.
The equation used is:

                  (t/T) - P = d

t = The total members assigned to the GSA, per risk group category, for the
Contractor

T = The total members assigned to the GSA, per risk group category, all
Contractors combined

P = The target percentage of members per risk group for the Contractor

d = The difference

The algorithm is calculated after each assignment to give a new difference for
each Contractor. When more than one Contractor has the same difference, and
their differences are greater than all other Contractors, the Contractor with
the lowest Health Plan I.D. Number will be assigned the case.

Assignment by the algorithm applies to:

     1.  Members that are newly eligible to the AHCCCS program that did not
         choose a Contractor within the prescribed time limits.

     2.  Members whose assigned health plan is no longer available after the
         member moves to a new GSA and did not choose a new Contractor within
         the prescribed time limits.

     3.  Members whose assigned plan is no longer available at the beginning of
         a contract cycle that did not choose a Contractor within the prescribed
         time limits.

All Contractors, within a given geographic service area (GSA) and for each risk
group, will have a placement in the algorithm and will receive members
accordingly. A Contractor with a more favorable target percentage in the
algorithm will receive proportionally more members. Conversely, a Contractor
with a lower target percentage in the algorithm will receive proportionally
fewer members. The algorithm favors Contractors with both lower final bids and
awarded rates. The algorithm also favors those Contractors with programs that
score higher based on AHCCCSA's evaluation criteria.

For Contractors in the Maricopa and Pima/Santa Cruz GSAs with fewer than 25,000
members statewide, a temporary adjustment will be made to the algorithm formula
in order to ensure a minimum membership (see the discussion entitled "Adjustment
Methodology for Contractors with Fewer than 25,000 Members" for more
information).

                                                                Acute Care RFP

DEVELOPMENT OF THE TARGET PERCENTAGES

For the first year of the contract, the algorithm target percentages will be
developed using the methodology described below. However, for subsequent years,
AHCCCS reserves the right to change the algorithm methodology to assure
assignments are made in the best interest of the AHCCCS program and the State.

A Contractor's placement in the algorithm is based upon the following three
factors, which are weighted as follows:

<TABLE>

1          The final capitation rate bid submitted by the Contractor. Final bids               30%
           that are below the bottom of the rate range will be assigned to the bottom
           of the rate range for development of the target percentages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2          The Contractor's final awarded rate from AHCCCSA.                                   30%

Points will be assigned to each Contractor by risk group by GSA. Based on the
rankings of the final bid rates and the final awarded rates, each Contractor
will be assigned a number of points for each of these two components separately
as follows:

ATTACHMENT G: AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM               CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Contractors that have equal program scores will be given an equal percentage of
the points for all of the positions combined.

The points awarded for the three components will be combined as follows to give
the target percentage for each Contractor by GSA by risk group:

(Final Bid Points (.30) + Awarded Bid Points (.30) + Program Score Points (.40)
/ 100  =  TARGET PERCENTAGE

ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY FOR CONTRACTORS WITH FEWER THAN 25,000 MEMBERS

At the beginning of the new contract cycle, the auto-assignment algorithm for
the Maricopa and Pima/Santa Cruz GSAs will be adjusted to favor Contractors with
fewer than 25,000 members statewide. The adjusted algorithm will be utilized
until a target membership of 25,000 members statewide, per Contractor, is
reached.

The adjustment will be made to the final percentages developed using the
methodology above. A pre-determined percentage, based on the table below, will
be added to the affected Contractor(s) and subtracted evenly from the other
Contractors.

this information to its enrollees within a reasonable time after the Contractor
receives notice of the recipient's enrollment. Additionally, the Contractor
shall provide written notification of any significant change in this policy at
least 30 days before the intended effective date of the change.

The written information provided to enrollees describing the Grievance System
including the grievance process, enrollee rights, grievance system requirements
and timeframes, shall be in each prevalent non-English language occurring within
the Contractor's service area and in an easily understood language and format.
The Contractor shall inform enrollees that oral interpretation services are
available in any language, that additional information is available in prevalent
non-English languages upon request and how enrollees may obtain this
information.

Written documents, including but not limited to the Contractor's Notice of
Action, the Notice of Contractor's Appeal/Grievance Resolution, Notice of
Contractor Extension for Resolution, and Notice of Contractor Extension of
Notice of Action shall be translated in the enrollee's language if information
is received by the Contractor, orally or in writing, indicating that the
enrollee has a limited English proficiency. Otherwise, these documents shall be
translated in the prevalent non-English language(s) or shall contain information
in the prevalent non- English language(s) advising the enrollee that the
information is available in the prevalent non-English language(s) and in
alternative formats along with an explanation of how enrollees may obtain this
information. This information must be in large, bold print appearing in a
prominent location on the first page of the document.

At a minimum, the Contractor's Grievance System Standards and Policy shall
specify:

     -    That the Contractor shall maintain records of all grievances and
          appeals.

     -    Information describing the grievance, appeal, and fair hearing
          procedures and timeframes describing the right to hearing, the method
          for obtaining a hearing, the rules which govern representation at the
          hearing, definitions of "action," "grievance," and "appeal," the right
          to file grievances and appeals and the requirements and timeframes for
          filing a grievance or appeal.

     -    Information explaining that a provider acting on behalf of an enrollee
          and with the enrollee's written consent, may file an appeal or
          grievance.

     -    The availability of assistance in the filing process and the
          Contractor's toll-free numbers that an enrollee can use to file a
          grievance or appeal by phone if requested by the enrollee.

     -    That an enrollee shall be given no less than 20 days (and no more than
          90 days) from the date of the Contractor's Notice of Action to file an
          appeal.

     -    That the Contractor shall mail a Notice of Action: 1) at least 10 days
          before the date of a termination, suspension or reduction of
          previously authorized AHCCCS services (include exception situations,
          fraud, move out of state); 2) at the time of any action affecting the
          claim when there has been a denial of payments; 3) within 14 calendar
          days from receipt of a request for a standard service authorization
          which has been denied or reduced unless an extension is in effect; 4)
          within three working days from receipt of an expedited service

ATTACHMENT I: ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION
REQUIREMENTS                                          CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

ATTACHMENT I: ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will be assessed sanctions for noncompliance with encounter
submission requirements. AHCCCSA may also perform special reviews of encounter
data, such as comparing encounter reports to the Contractor's claims files. Any
findings of incomplete or inaccurate encounter data may result in the imposition
of sanctions or requirement of a corrective action plan.

PENDED ENCOUNTER CORRECTIONS

The Contractor must resolve all pended encounters within 120 days of the
original processing date. Sanctions will be imposed according to the following
schedule for each encounter pended for more than 120 days unless the pend is due
to AHCCCSA error:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
0 - 120 days       121 - 180 days        181 - 240 days        241 - 360 days        361 + days
<S>                <C>                   <C>                   <C>                   <C>
No sanction        $ 5 per month         $ 10 per month        $ 15 per month        $ 20 per month
</TABLE>

"AHCCCSA error" is defined as a pended encounter, which (1) AHCCCSA acknowledges
to be the result of its own error, and (2) requires a change to the system
programming, an update to the database reference table, or further research by
AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust the sanction amount if
circumstances warrant.

When the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA, in writing, that the resolution of a
pended encounter depends on AHCCCSA rather than the Contractor, AHCCCSA will
respond in writing within 30 days of receipt of such notification. The AHCCCSA
response will report the status of each pending encounter problem or issue in
question.

Pended encounters will not qualify as AHCCCSA errors if AHCCCSA reviews the
Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to research the issue and
provide additional substantiating documentation, or if AHCCCSA disagrees with
the Contractor's claim of AHCCCSA error. If a pended encounter being researched
by AHCCCSA is later determined not to be caused by AHCCCSA error, the Contractor
may be sanctioned retroactively.

Before imposing sanctions, AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor, in writing, of
the total number of sanctionable encounters pended more than 120 days. Pended
encounters shall not be deleted by the Contractor as a means of avoiding
sanctions for failure to correct encounters within 120 days. The Contractor
shall document deleted encounters and shall maintain a record of the deleted
CRNs with appropriate reasons indicated. The Contractor shall, upon request,
make this documentation available to AHCCCSA for review.

ENCOUNTER VALIDATION STUDIES

Per CMS requirement, AHCCCSA will conduct encounter validation studies of the
Contractor's encounter submissions, and sanction the Contractor for
noncompliance with encounter submission requirements. The purpose of encounter
validation studies is to compare recorded utilization information from a medical
record or other source with the Contractor's submitted encounter data. Any and
all covered services may be validated as part of these studies. Encounter
validation studies will be conducted at least yearly.

AHCCCSA may revise study methodology, timelines, and sanction amounts based on
agency review or as a result of consultations with CMS. The Contractor will be
notified in writing of any significant change in study methodology.

                                                                Acute Care RFP
                                                                February 3, 2003

ATTACHMENT I: ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION
REQUIREMENTS                                          CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

AHCCCSA will conduct two encounter validation studies. Study "A" examines
non-institutional services (form HCFA 1500 encounters), and Study "B" examines
institutional services (form UB-92 encounters).

AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction amounts and of the
selected data needed for encounter validation studies. The Contractor will have
90 days to submit the requested data to AHCCCSA. In the case of medical records
requests, the Contractor's failure to provide AHCCCSA with the records requested
within 90 days may result in a sanction of $1,000 per missing medical record. If
AHCCCSA does not receive a sufficient number of medical records from the
Contractor to select a statistically valid sample for a study, the Contractor
may be sanctioned up to 5% of its annual capitation payment.

The criteria used in encounter validation studies may include timeliness,
correctness, and omission of encounters. These criteria are defined as follows:

Timeliness: The time elapsed between the date of service and the date that the
encounter is received at AHCCCS. All encounters must be received by AHCCCSA no
later than 240 days after the end of the month in which the service was
rendered, or the effective date of enrollment with the Contractor, whichever is
later. For all encounters for which timeliness is evaluated, a sanction per
encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if
the encounter record is received by AHCCCSA more than 240 days after the date
determined above. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be $1.00 per
error extrapolated to the population of encounters; however, sanction amounts
may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has changed, or if
CMS changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be notified of the
sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the studies begin.

Correctness: A correct encounter contains a complete and accurate description of
AHCCCS covered services provided to a member. A sanction per encounter error
extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if the encounter is
incomplete or incorrectly coded. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will
be $1.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters; however,
sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality
has changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be
notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the
studies begin.

Omission of data: An encounter not submitted to AHCCCSA or an encounter
inappropriately deleted from AHCCCSA's pending encounter file or historical
files in lieu of correction of such record. For Study "A" and for Study "B", a
sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be
assessed for an omission. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be
$5.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "A" and
$10.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "B";
however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter
quality has changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements. The Contractor
will be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time
the studies begin.

For encounter validation studies, AHCCCSA will select all approved and pended
encounters to be studied no earlier than 240 days after the end of the month in
which the service was rendered. Once AHCCCSA has selected the Contractor's
encounters for encounter validation studies, subsequent encounter submissions
for the period being studied will not be considered.

AHCCCSA may review all of the Contractor's submitted encounters, or may select a
sample. The sample size, or number of encounters to be reviewed, will be
determined using statistical methods in order to accurately estimate the
Contractor's error rates. Error rates will be calculated by dividing the number
of errors found by the number of encounters reviewed. A 95% confidence interval
will be used to account for limitations caused by sampling. The confidence
interval shows the range within which the true error rate is estimated to be. If
error rates are based on a sample, the error rate used for sanction purposes
will be the lower limit of the confidence interval.

REQUIREMENTS                                          CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH04-0001

Encounter validation methodology and statistical formulas are provided in the
AHCCCS Encounter Data Validation Technical Document, which is available in the
Bidders Library. This document also provides examples, which illustrate how
AHCCCSA determines study sample sizes, error rates, confidence intervals, and
sanction amounts.

Written preliminary results of all encounter validation studies will be sent to
the Contractor for review and comment. The Contractor will have a maximum of 30
days to review results and provide AHCCCSA with additional documentation that
would affect the final calculation of error rates and sanctions. AHCCCSA will
examine the Contractor's documentation and may revise study results if
warranted. Written final results of the study will then be sent to the
Contractor and communicated to CMS, and any sanctions will be assessed.

The Contractor may file a written challenge to sanctions assessed by AHCCCSA not
more than 35 days after the Contractor receives final study results from
AHCCCSA. Challenges will be reviewed by AHCCCSA and a written decision will be
rendered no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of a timely challenge.
Sanctions shall not apply to encounter errors successfully challenged. A
challenge must be filed on a timely basis and a decision must be rendered by
AHCCCSA prior to filing a grievance and request for hearing pursuant to Article
8 of AHCCCS Rules. Sanction amounts will be deducted from the Contractor's
capitation payment.

ENCOUNTER CORRECTIONS

Contractors are required to submit replacement or voided encounters in the event
that claims are subsequently corrected following the initial encounter
submission. This includes corrections as a result of inaccuracies identified by
fraud and abuse audits or investigations conducted by AHCCCSA or the Contractor.
Contractors shall refer to the Encounter Reporting User Manual for instructions
regarding submission of corrected encounters.

These are minimum requirements. If at any time other procedures, tests, etc. are
medically indicated, the physician is obligated to perform them. If a child
comes under care for the first time at any point on the schedule, or if any
items are not accomplished at the suggested age, the schedule should be brought
up to date at the earliest possible time.

Key: x      = to be completed   + = to be performed for members at risk when
     indicated.

<----x---->  = the range during which a service may be provided, with the x
     indicating the preferred age.

*   Members not previously screened who fall within this range (36 to 72 months
    of age) must have a blood lead screen performed.

**  See separate schedule for detail.

*** If American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines are used for the screening
    schedule and/or more screenings are medically necessary, those additional
