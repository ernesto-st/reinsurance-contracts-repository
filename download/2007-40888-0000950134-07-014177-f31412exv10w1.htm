Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable

excess foreign tax credit position or (ii)&nbsp;it believes in good faith, in its sole
discretion, that claiming a refund or credit would cause adverse tax consequences to it. In
the event that such Lender receives such a refund or credit, such Lender shall pay to the
Borrower an amount that such Lender reasonably determines is equal to the net tax benefit
obtained by such Lender as a result of such payment by the Borrower. In the event that no
refund or credit is obtained with respect to the Borrower&#146;s payments to such Lender pursuant
