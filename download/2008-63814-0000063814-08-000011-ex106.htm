Fixed Rate and shall be computed as set forth in the Note. If Owner fails to
make any payment of principal, interest, Make-Whole Premium or Defeasance
Deposit, whether as a Debt Service Payment, at maturity, as part of any
prepayment, defeasance, upon acceleration or otherwise, as set forth in the Loan
Documents within two (2) Business Days after the delivery of written notice to

Date, Owner shall pay to Lender all amounts owing under the Loan Documents

Interest and any Make-Whole Premium. The Note is subject to prepayment as set
forth in Section 2.9 and is subject to defeasance as set forth in Section

extent not theretofore paid, together with all accrued but unpaid interest
thereon and any other Indebtedness due hereunder, under the Note or under any

such prepayment, such that upon the due payment of all remaining Debt Service
Payments, there shall have been paid to Lender the entire unpaid principal
amount of the Note together with accrued interest thereon on a stepped
installment payment basis. Schedule 1 shall be revised by Owner to so reamortize
the remaining Debt Service Payments and a new Schedule 1 shall be delivered to
Lender to be substituted for the Schedule 1 then attached to the Note. Such
revised Schedule 1 shall reflect payments on the same Payment Dates set forth in
the original Schedule 1 and at the same interest rate utilized in the original
Schedule 1 over the remaining life of the Note and, absent error, the Debt
Service Payments thereafter due on the Note shall be those set forth in such

Lease. In connection with any such sublease or assignment by Tenant, there shall
be delivered to Landlord each item with respect thereto which is required (or
which may be requested by Lender) pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Master Lease,
each of which is hereby required by this Indenture. In addition, in connection
with any merger, consolidation or sale of assets relating to Tenant pursuant to
Section 10.3 of the Master Lease, Landlord shall cause to be delivered to Lender
an acknowledged instrument in recordable form executed by the surviving entity
or transferee of assets, as the case may be, assuming all obligations, covenants
and responsibilities of Tenant under the Master Lease and under any other
Operative Document, together with each other item required to be delivered
pursuant to said Section 10.3 of the Master Lease, each of which is hereby
required by this Indenture. At all times the obligations of Tenant under the
Master Lease shall be guaranteed by Master Lease Guarantor pursuant to the
Master Lease Guaranty. Owner will punctually perform all obligations, covenants
and agreements by it to be performed as landlord under the Master Lease in
accordance therewith, and will at all time do all things reasonably necessary to
compel performance by Tenant of all of its obligations, covenants and agreements
under the Master Lease. Owner will punctually perform all obligations, covenants

Document promptly after obtaining actual knowledge thereof. Owner will not amend

Document without the prior written consent of Lender (which will not be withheld
in the case of the Option Agreement or the Tripartite Agreement provided that
Lender receives the Rating Agencies confirmation required with respect thereto)
and without delivering to Lender evidence in writing from the Rating Agencies
that such amendment will not result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade
of any then current ratings for any Securities issued in connection with any
Secondary Market Transaction. Owner will maintain the validity and effectiveness
of the assignment to Lender of the Master Lease, the Master Lease Guaranty and
the other Granting Clause Documents made by this Indenture and the Master Lease
Assignment, all as specified in such documents and, except as expressly
permitted by the Master Lease, this Indenture or the Master Lease Assignment,

omission would release Tenant from its obligations or liabilities under the
Master Lease or the Assignment, or of any other party from its obligations or
liabilities under the Master Lease Guaranty or any other Granting Clause
Document, or, except as expressly permitted in this Indenture and therein, would

Account. Owner shall, however, have the right to communicate with the depository
Institution which holds the Central Account to determine if any payment required
to be made under the Master Lease has been deposited into the Central Account.

be paid by Owner or Owner shall cause Tenant to pay the same.</font></div>

Indenture constitutes a security agreement under the Code and serves as a
fixture filing in accordance with the Code. Owner hereby confirms the grant of a
security interest pursuant to Granting Clause Second in favor of Trustee, if
applicable, and Lender as secured party under the Code with respect to all
property (specifically including the Collateral) now or hereafter included in
the Mortgaged Property which is covered by the Code. Among other things, this
Indenture is filed as a fixture filing and covers property which is or will
become fixtures on the Mortgaged Property. The mention in a Financing Statement
filed in the records normally pertaining to personal property of any portion of
the Mortgaged Property shall not derogate from or impair in any manner the
intention of Owner and Lender hereby declared that all Equipment is part of the
real property encumbered by the Indenture to the fullest extent permitted by
law, regardless of whether any such item is physically attached to the
Improvements or whether serial numbers are used for the better identification of
certain items. Specifically, the mention in any such Financing Statement of the
rights in or to (i) any Insurance Proceeds, (ii) any Condemnation Proceeds,
(iii) Owner's interest in any Leases or Property Income, or (iv) any other item
included in the Mortgaged Property, shall not be construed to alter, impair or
impugn any rights of Lender as determined by this Indenture, or the priority of
Lender's lien upon and security interest in, that portion of the Mortgaged
Property which constitutes real property. Any such mention shall be for the
protection of Lender in the event that notice of Lender's priority of interest
as to any portion of the Mortgaged Property is required to be filed in
accordance with the Code to be effective against or take priority over the
interest of any particular class of persons, including the federal government or
any subdivision or instrumentality thereof.</font></div>

Owner shall notify Lender of, and shall defend the Collateral against, all

therein. Owner will execute and deliver to Lender for filing a Financing
Statement or Financing Statements in connection with the Collateral in the form

extent that it may be perfected by such a filing. Owner agrees that at any time
and from time to time, at the expense of Owner, Owner shall promptly execute and
deliver all further instruments, and take all further action, that Lender may
request, in order to perfect and protect the pledge, security interest and lien
granted or purported to be granted hereby, or to enable Lender to exercise and
enforce Lender's rights and remedies hereunder with respect to, the

not be deemed or construed to be Lender's consent or approval in any like matter
arising at a subsequent date, and the failure of Lender to promptly exercise any
right, power, remedy, consent or approval provided herein or at law or in equity
shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of the same nor shall Lender be
estopped from exercising such right, power, remedy, consent or approval at a

hereto shall be narrowly construed to be applicable only to the matter
identified in such consent or approval and to the Person and/or Persons with
respect to whom such consent or approval was delivered by Lender and no third
party shall claim any benefit by reason thereof. Any such consent or approval
shall not be deemed to constitute Lender a venturer or partner with any Person
benefitting from such consent or approval nor shall privity of contract be
presumed to have been established with any other third party. If Lender deems it
to be in its best interest to retain assistance of Persons (including, without
limitation, attorneys, title insurance companies, appraisers, engineers and
surveyors) with respect to a request for consent or approval, Owner shall
reimburse, or shall cause Tenant to reimburse, Lender for all costs reasonably

parties hereto intend to conform to and contract in strict conformance with all
applicable usury laws. The provisions of this Indenture, the Note and of all
agreements between Owner and Lender are hereby expressly limited so that in no
contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of prepayment, late payment,
default, demand for payment, acceleration of the maturity of this Note or
otherwise, shall the amount contracted for, charged, paid or agreed to be paid
to Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of money to be loaned under the
Note or this Indenture or otherwise (including the Make-Whole Premium and/or the
Late Charges, if and to the extent either or both are deemed to be interest
under applicable law) exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable law
(the <font style="DISPLAY: inline; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">"Maximum
Rate").</font> If, from any circumstance whatsoever, performance or fulfillment
of any provision hereof, of the Note or of any of the other Loan Documents or of
any agreement between Owner and Lender shall, at the time of the execution and
delivery thereof or at the time performance of such provision shall be due,
involve or purport to require any payment in excess of the limits prescribed by
law, the obligation to be performed or fulfilled shall be reduced automatically
to the limit of such validity without the necessity of execution of any
amendment or new document. If, from any circumstance whatsoever, Lender shall
ever receive anything of value deemed interest under applicable law which would
exceed interest at the Maximum Rate, an amount equal to any amount which would
have been excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
outstanding principal balance of this Note in the inverse order of its maturity
and not to the payment of interest, or if such amount which would have been
excessive interest exceeds the outstanding principal balance of this Note, such
excess shall be refunded to Owner. All sums contracted for, charged, paid or
agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the
Indebtedness of Owner to Lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated
term of such Indebtedness so that the amount of interest on account of such
Indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein or any of the other Operative Documents, it is not the
intention of Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not
accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the
time of such acceleration. The provisions of this paragraph shall control all
existing and future agreements between Owner and Lender.</font></div>
