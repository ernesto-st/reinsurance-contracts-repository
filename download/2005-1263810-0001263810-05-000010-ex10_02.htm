          No failure or delay of Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder shall
          operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
          such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce

          hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that
          they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provisions of this Agreement or
          consent to any departure by any Obligor therefrom shall in any event be
          effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then
          such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for

          shall entitle an Obligor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
