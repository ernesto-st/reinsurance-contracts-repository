                                   THE CREDITS

                           SECTION 2.01. COMMITMENTS. Subject to the terms and
conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth,
each Lender agrees, severally and not jointly:

                  (a)      to make a Term Loan to Borrower on the Closing Date
         in a principal amount not to exceed its Term Loan Commitment; and

                  (b)      to make Revolving Loans to Borrower, at any time and
         from time to time on or after the Closing Date, and until the earlier
         of the second Business Day preceding the Revolving Maturity Date and
         the termination of the Commitment of such Lender in accordance with the
         terms hereof, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding
         that will not result in such Lender's Revolving Exposure exceeding such
         Lender's Revolving Commitment; provided, however, that Revolving Loans
         made on the Closing Date shall not exceed $4.0 million.

                  Amounts paid or prepaid in respect of Term Loans may not be
reborrowed. Within the limits set forth in clause (b) above and subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations set forth herein, Borrower may borrow, pay or
prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

                           SECTION 2.02. LOANS. (a) Each Loan (other than
Swingline Loans) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made
by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their applicable Commitments;
provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall not in
itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being
understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender). Except
for Loans deemed made pursuant to Section 2.02(f), Loans comprising any
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (i) an integral
multiple of $250,000 and not less than $1.0 million or (ii) equal to the
remaining available balance of the applicable Commitments.

                  (b)      Subject to Sections 2.11 and 2.12, each Borrowing
shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as Borrower may
request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option make any
Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan, so long as such option does not result in increased
costs to Borrower; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect
the obligation of Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same
time; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be entitled to request any
Borrowing that, if made, would result in more than ten Eurodollar Borrowings
outstanding hereunder at any time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings
having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the
same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.

<PAGE>

                  (c)      Except with respect to Loans made pursuant to Section
2.02(f), each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the
proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may designate not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
credit the amounts so received to an account as directed by Borrower in the
applicable Borrowing Request maintained with the Administrative Agent or, if a
Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein
specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the
respective Lenders.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with paragraph (c) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds
available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion
available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and Borrower severally agree
to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
made available to Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the
case of such Lender, a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent
its cost of overnight or short-term funds (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error). If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute
such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or
continue, any Borrowing constituting Revolving Loans or Term Loans if the
Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Revolving
Maturity Date or the Term Loan Maturity Date, as the case may be.

                  (f)      If the Issuing Bank shall not have received from
Borrower the payment required to be made by Section 2.18(e) within the time
specified in such Section, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the
Administrative Agent of the LC Disbursement and the Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Revolving Lender of such LC Disbursement and its Pro Rata
Percentage thereof. Each Revolving Lender shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent on such date (or, if
such Revolving Lender shall have received such notice later than 12:00 (noon),
New York City time, on any day, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the immediately following Business Day), an amount equal to such Lender's Pro
Rata Percentage of such LC Disbursement (it being understood that such amount
shall be deemed to constitute an ABR Revolving Loan of such Lender, and such
payment shall be deemed to have reduced the LC Exposure), and the Administrative
Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing
Bank any amounts received by it from Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18(e) prior
to the time that any Revolving Lender makes any payment pursuant to this
paragraph (f); any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent thereafter
will be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders
that shall have made such payments and to the Issuing Bank, as their interests
may appear. If any Revolving Lender shall not have made its Pro Rata Percentage
of such LC Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent as provided above,
such Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay interest on such amount, for
each day from and including the date such amount is required to be paid in
accordance with this paragraph (f) to but excluding the date such amount is
paid, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank at (i) in
the case of Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to
Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06(a), and

                                      -33-

<PAGE>
(ii) in the case of such Lender, for the first such day, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate, and for each day thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate.

                           SECTION 2.03. BORROWING PROCEDURE. To request a
Revolving Borrowing or Term Borrowing, Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent of such request by telephone (promptly confirmed by telecopy) (a) in the
case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time,
three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case
of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, one Business
Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of
an ABR Revolving Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
contemplated by Section 2.18(e) may be given not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form
approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by Borrower. Each such
telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information
in compliance with Section 2.02:

                  (a)      whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Revolving
         Borrowing or a Term Borrowing;

                  (b)      the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;

                  (c)      the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business
         Day;

                  (d)      whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
         Eurodollar Borrowing;

                  (e)      in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial
         Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
         contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; provided
         that until the earlier of (i) the date which is 30 days after the
         Closing Date and (ii) the date on which a successful syndication of the
         Loans and Commitments shall have been declared by the Joint Lead
         Arrangers, Borrower shall only be permitted to request an Interest
         Period of seven days; and

                  (f)      the location and number of Borrower's account to
         which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
         requirements of Section 2.02.

                  If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then
the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is
specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration (subject to the proviso of clause (e) above). Promptly following
receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

                           SECTION 2.04. EVIDENCE OF DEBT; REPAYMENT OF LOANS.
(a) Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender holding Term Loans, the principal amount of
each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.09, (ii) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender, the then unpaid
principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Maturity
Date and (iii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Revolving Maturity Date and the first date
after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar
month and is at least five Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made;
provided that on each date that a

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

Revolving Borrowing is made, Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans that were
outstanding on the date such Borrowing was requested.

                  (b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time,
including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender
from time to time under this Agreement.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in
which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type and
Class thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto; (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower
to each Lender hereunder; and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's
share thereof.

                  (d)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant
to paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence
and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of Borrower to
repay the Loans in accordance with their terms.

                  (e)      Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made
by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of
such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

                           SECTION 2.05. FEES.

                  (a)      COMMITMENT FEE. Borrower agrees to pay to each
Lender, through the Administrative Agent, on the last Business Day of March,
June, September and December in each year and on each date on which any
Commitment of such Lender shall expire or be terminated as provided herein, a
commitment fee (a "COMMITMENT FEE") equal to 0.50% per annum on the average
daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the
preceding quarter (or other period commencing with the Closing Date or ending
with the Revolving Maturity Date or the date on which the Revolving Commitment
of such Lender shall expire or be terminated). All Commitment Fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360
days. The Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall commence to accrue on the
Closing Date and shall cease to accrue on the date on which the Revolving
Commitment of such Lender shall expire or be terminated as provided herein.

                  (b)      ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES. Borrower agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the agency fees set forth in the
Fee Letter or such other fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately
agreed upon between Borrower and the Administrative Agent (the "ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT FEES").

                  (c)      LC AND FRONTING FEES. Borrower agrees to pay (i) to
the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a
participation fee ("LC PARTICIPATION FEE") with respect to its participations in
Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin
from time to time used to determine the interest rate on Eurodollar Revolving
Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC
Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Revolving
Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC
Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee ("FRONTING FEE"), which
shall accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of the
LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC
Disbursements) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and
the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing
Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. LC
Participation Fees and Fronting Fees accrued through and including the last day
of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the
third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to
occur after the Closing Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on
the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing
after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on
demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph
shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All LC Participation Fees and
Fronting Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

                  All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as
appropriate, among the Lenders, except that the Fronting Fees shall be paid
directly to the Issuing Bank. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable
under any circumstances (absent manifest error).

                           SECTION 2.06. INTEREST ON LOANS. (a) Subject to the
provisions of Section 2.06(c), the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing,
including each Swingline Loan, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time.

                  (b)      Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(c), the
Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period in effect for
such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by Borrower hereunder is
not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise,
such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a
rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of any overdue principal of or interest
on any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in
the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other
amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in
paragraph (a) of this Section.

                  (d)      Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in
arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of
Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that
(i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable
on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other
than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving
Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid
shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the
event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current
Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the
effective date of such conversion.

                  (e)      All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the
Alternate Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a

                                      -36-

<PAGE>

year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                           SECTION 2.07. TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF
COMMITMENTS. (a) The Term Loan Commitments shall automatically terminate on the
Closing Date. The Revolving Commitments, the Swingline Commitment and the LC
Commitment shall automatically terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date.

                  (b)      Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to
time reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of
the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple
of $250,000 and not less than $1.0 million and (ii) the Revolving Commitments
shall not be terminated or reduced if, after giving effect to any concurrent
prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.10 or Section
2.01, as applicable, the sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the
aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments.

                  (c)      Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable. Any termination or
reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of
the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.

                           SECTION 2.08. INTEREST ELECTIONS. (a) Each Revolving
Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the
applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall
have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.
Thereafter, Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or
to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect
Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. Borrower may elect
different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing,
in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply
to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

                  (b)      To make an election pursuant to this Section,
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by
the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if
Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing or Term Borrowing of the Type
resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.
Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be
confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a
written Interest Election Request substantially in the form of Exhibit E.

                  (c)      Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                  (i)      the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
         applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
         different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
         each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
         pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
         resulting Borrowing);

                                      -37-

<PAGE>

                  (ii)     the effective date of the election made pursuant to
         such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
         Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                  (iv)     if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing,
         the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
         such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition
         of the term "Interest Period"; provided that until the earlier of (i)
         the date which is 30 days after the Closing Date and (ii) the date on
         which a successful syndication of the Loans and Commitments shall have
         been declared by the Joint Lead Arrangers, Borrower shall be permitted
         to request an Interest Period of seven days only.

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected
an Interest Period of one month's duration (subject to the proviso in clause
(iv) above).

                  (d)      Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                  (e)      If an Interest Election Request with respect to a
Eurodollar Borrowing is not timely delivered prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided
herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the
request of the Required Lenders, so notifies Borrower, then, after the
occurrence and during the continuance of such Event of Default, (i) no
outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing
and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

                           SECTION 2.09. AMORTIZATION OF TERM BORROWINGS. (a)
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders,
on the dates set forth on Annex I, or if any such date is not a Business Day, on
the next preceding Business Day (each such date being a "TERM LOAN REPAYMENT
DATE"), a principal amount of the Term Loans (as adjusted from time to time
pursuant to Sections 2.09(b) and 2.10) equal to the amount set forth on Annex I
for such date, together in each case with accrued and unpaid interest on the
principal amount to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment.

                  (b)      To the extent not previously paid, all Term Loans
shall be due and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

                           SECTION 2.10. OPTIONAL AND MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF
LOANS.

                  (a)      OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Borrower shall have the right
at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part,
subject to the requirements of this Section; provided, however, that each
partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
$500,000 and not less than $1.0 million.

                  (b)      REVOLVING LOAN PREPAYMENTS. In the event of any
termination of all the Revolving Commitments, Borrower shall, on the date of
such termination, repay or prepay all its outstanding

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

Revolving Borrowings and all outstanding Swingline Loans and replace all
outstanding Letters of Credit and/or deposit an amount equal to the LC Exposure
in the LC Sub-Account. In the event of any partial reduction of the Revolving
Commitments, then (i) at or prior to the effective date of such reduction, the
Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and the Revolving Lenders of the sum
of the Revolving Exposures after giving effect thereto and (ii) if the sum of
the Revolving Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving
Commitments after giving effect to such reduction or termination, then Borrower
shall, on the date of such reduction or termination, repay or prepay Revolving
Borrowings or Swingline Loans (or a combination thereof) and/or replace or cash
collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount sufficient to eliminate
such excess.

                  (c)      ASSET SALES. Not later than five Business Days
following the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale, Borrower shall
apply 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received with respect thereto to make
prepayments in accordance with Sections 2.10(i) and (j); provided that:

                  (i)      no such prepayment shall be required with respect to
         (A) any Asset Sale permitted by Section 6.04(b)(ii), (b)(iii), (d),
         (e), (h), (i) or (j), (B) the disposition of assets subject to a
         condemnation or eminent domain proceeding or insurance settlement to
         the extent it does not constitute a Casualty Event, or (C) Asset Sales
         for fair market value resulting in no more than $1.0 million in Net
         Cash Proceeds per Asset Sale (or series of related Asset Sales) and
         less than $3.0 million in Net Cash Proceeds in any fiscal year; and

                  (ii)     so long as no Default shall then exist or would arise
         therefrom and the aggregate of such Net Cash Proceeds of Asset Sales
         shall not exceed $20.0 million in any fiscal year of Borrower, such
         proceeds shall not be required to be so applied on such date to the
         extent that Borrower shall have delivered a certificate to the
         Administrative Agent on or prior to such date stating that such Net
         Cash Proceeds shall be used (x) to purchase replacement assets or fixed
         or capital assets used or usable in the business of Borrower and the
         Subsidiaries, (y) to repair such assets or (z) to acquire 100% of the
         Equity Interests of any person that owns such replacement or other such
         assets no later than 360 days following the date of such Asset Sale
         (which certificate shall set forth the estimates of the proceeds to be
         so expended); provided, however, that if all or any portion of such Net
         Cash Proceeds not required to be applied to make prepayments as a
         result of this clause (ii) shall not be so reinvested as set forth in
         clauses (x), (y) and (z) within such 360-day period, such unused
         portion shall be applied on the last day of such period as a mandatory
         prepayment as provided in this Section 2.10(c).

                  (d)      DEBT OR PREFERRED STOCK ISSUANCE. Upon any Debt
Issuance or any Preferred Stock Issuance after the Closing Date, Borrower shall
make prepayments in accordance with Sections 2.10(i) and (j) in an aggregate
principal amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt Issuance or
Preferred Stock Issuance.

                  (e)      EQUITY ISSUANCE. Upon any Equity Issuance (other than
a Preferred Stock Issuance) after the Closing Date, Borrower shall make
prepayments in accordance with Sections 2.10(i) and (j) in an aggregate
principal amount equal to 50% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equity Issuance;
provided that if the Leverage Ratio after giving pro forma effect to such
prepayment as of the most recently ended Test Period after the first anniversary
of the Closing Date for which financial statements are available is less than
1.25 to 1.0, no such prepayment shall be required.

                  (f)      CASUALTY EVENTS. Not later than five Business Days
following the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from a Casualty Event, Borrower
shall apply an amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds to make
prepayments in accordance with Sections 2.10(i) and (j); provided, however,
that:

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

                  (i)      so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists
         or would arise therefrom, the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall not be
         required to be so applied on such date to the extent that Borrower has
         delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Collateral Agent on or prior
         to such date stating that such proceeds shall be used (A) to fund the
         acquisition or repair of property or the acquisition of 100% of the
         Equity Interests of any person that owns property used or usable in the
         business of Borrower and the Subsidiaries or (B) to repair, replace or
         restore the property in accordance with the provisions of this
         Agreement and the applicable Security Document in respect of which such
         Casualty Event has occurred; provided that, in each case, the actions
         described in clauses (A) and (B) above are commenced by Borrower within
         360 days following the date of the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds
         and are diligently pursued to satisfactory completion to the extent
         practicable in the good faith estimate of Borrower,

                  (ii)     to the extent such Casualty Event affects any of the
         Collateral, all property acquired to effect any repair, replacement or
         restoration of such Collateral shall be made subject to the Lien of the
         Security Documents in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.11,

                  (iii)    all such Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $10.0 million
         in the aggregate for all such Casualty Events shall be held in the
         Collateral Account and released therefrom only in accordance with the
         terms of Article IX, and

                  (iv)     if all or any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds shall
         not be so applied within such 360-day period, such unused portion shall
         be applied on the last day of such period as a mandatory prepayment as
         provided in this Section 2.10(f).

                  (g)      EXCESS CASH FLOW. No later than the earlier of (i) 90
days after the end of each fiscal year of Borrower, commencing with the fiscal
year ending October 1, 2004, and (ii) the date on which the financial statements
with respect to such period are delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a), Borrower
shall make prepayments in accordance with Sections 2.10(i) and (j) in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the ECF Percentage of Excess Cash Flow for
the fiscal year then ended; provided that if the Borrower makes any optional
prepayment of Loans during any fiscal year with funds which would otherwise
constitute "Excess Cash Flow" for such fiscal year (all such payments, the "ECF
OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS"), no deduction for such ECF Optional Prepayments shall be
made in calculating Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year (Excess Cash Flow
without such deduction is herein referred to as "GROSS EXCESS CASH FLOW"). If
the ECF Optional Prepayments for such fiscal year equal or exceed the ECF
Percentage of Gross Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year, no prepayment shall
be required pursuant to this Section 2.10(g) for such fiscal year. To the extent
that the ECF Optional Prepayments for such fiscal year are less than the ECF
Percentage of Gross Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year (such difference, the
"EXCESS CASH FLOW SHORTFALL"), subject to the proviso of the first sentence of
this Section 2.10(g), the Borrower shall be required only to prepay an amount
equal to such Excess Cash Flow Shortfall in respect of such fiscal year pursuant
to this Section 2.10(g).

                  (h)      ESCROW PROCEEDS. No later than five Business Days
following the receipt of any Escrow Proceeds, Borrower shall apply an amount
equal to 100% of such Escrow Proceeds to make prepayments in accordance with
Sections 2.10(i) and (j).

                  (i)      APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS. (i) Optional prepayments
in respect of Term Loans under this Agreement and mandatory prepayments pursuant
to Section 2.10(d) or (e) shall be applied first to reduce remaining scheduled
installments of principal due in respect of outstanding Term Loans under Section
2.09 in direct order of maturity up to but not including the first scheduled
installment due after the date that is 12 months following the date of such
prepayment. After application of prepayments pursuant to the first sentence of
this paragraph (i)(i) and to the extent there are mandatory prepayment

                                      -40-

<PAGE>

amounts remaining after such application, such excess prepayments shall be
applied (x) first, to reduce outstanding Term Loans pro rata against the
remaining scheduled installments of principal due in respect of the Term Loans
under Section 2.09 up to but not including the September 30, 2009 scheduled
installment and (y) second, to the scheduled installment amounts on and after
September 30, 2009, in direct order of maturity. Mandatory prepayments pursuant
to Sections 2.10(c), (f), (g) or (h) shall be applied (x) first, to reduce
outstanding Term Loans pro rata against the remaining scheduled installments of
principal due in respect of the Term Loans under Section 2.09, up to but not
including the September 30, 2009 scheduled installment and (y) second, to the
scheduled installment amounts on and after September 30, 2009, in direct order
of maturity.

                  (ii)     After application of prepayments pursuant to
         paragraph (i)(i) and to the extent there are mandatory prepayment
         amounts remaining after such application (x) in the case of a mandatory
         prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(d), (e), (g), or (h), Borrower
         shall first, repay outstanding Revolving Loans in an amount equal to
         such excess and second, the Revolving Commitments shall be reduced (but
         not to below $20.0 million) ratably among the Revolving Lenders in
         accordance with their applicable Revolving Commitments in an aggregate
         amount equal to the excess remaining after such repayment of Revolving
         Loans or (y) in the case of a mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section
         2.10(c) or (f), the Revolving Commitments shall be reduced (but not to
         below $20.0 million) ratably among the Revolving Lenders in accordance
         with their applicable Revolving Commitments in an aggregate amount
         equal to such excess, provided, in either case, Borrower shall comply
         with Section 2.10(b). Any remaining prepayment amounts after the
         application pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph (i)(ii)
         may be retained by Borrower.

                  (iii)    Amounts to be applied pursuant to this Section 2.10
         to the prepayment of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall be applied,
         as applicable, first to reduce outstanding ABR Term Loans and ABR
         Revolving Loans, respectively. Any amounts remaining after each such
         application shall be applied to prepay Eurodollar Term Loans or
         Eurodollar Revolving Loans, as applicable. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, if the amount of any prepayment of Loans required under this
         Section 2.10 shall be in excess of the amount of the ABR Loans at the
         time outstanding, only the portion of the amount of such prepayment as
         is equal to the amount of such outstanding ABR Loans shall be
         immediately prepaid and, at the election of Borrower, the balance of
         such required prepayment shall be either (i) deposited in the
         Collateral Account and applied to the prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on
         the last day of the then next-expiring Interest Period for Eurodollar
         Loans (with all interest accruing thereon for the account of Borrower)
         or (ii) prepaid immediately, together with any amounts owing to the
         Lenders under Section 2.13. Notwithstanding any such deposit in the
         Collateral Account, interest shall continue to accrue on such Loans
         until prepayment.

                  (j)      NOTICE OF PREPAYMENT. Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the
Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment
hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of
prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment
or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each
Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory
prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment.
Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating
solely to Swingline Loans), the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of
the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an
amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the
same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the
required amount of a

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to
the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by
accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.06.

                           SECTION 2.11. ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST. If prior to
the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                  (a)      the Administrative Agent determines (which
         determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate
         and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBOR
         Rate for such Interest Period; or

                  (b)      the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required
         Lenders that the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period will not
         adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or
         maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest
         Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

                           SECTION 2.12. INCREASED COSTS. (a) If any Change in
Law shall:

                  (i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
         special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
         or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any
         such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBOR Rate) or the
         Issuing Bank; or

                  (ii)     impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the
         London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
         Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
         participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b)      If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on
the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters
of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to
such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional

                                      -42-

<PAGE>

amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c)      A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting
forth the basis for its claim and the calculation of the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company,
as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall
be delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower
shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown
as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                  (d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such
compensation; provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a
Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that if the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the
period of retroactive effect thereof.

                           SECTION 2.13. BREAKAGE PAYMENTS. In the event of (a)
the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any
notice delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result
of a request by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16, then, in any such event,
Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or
expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the
period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the
amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period
at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and
period from other banks in the Eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender
setting forth the basis for its claim and the calculation of any amount or
amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall
be delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

                           SECTION 2.14. PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT;
SHARING OF SETOFFS. (a) Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by
it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest,
fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section
2.12, 2.13 or 2.15, or otherwise) on or before the time expressly required
hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such
time is expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

677 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut, except payments to be made
directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein
and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15 and 11.03 shall
be made directly to the persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other
Loan Documents shall be made to the persons specified therein. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the
account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day
that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

                  (b)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c)      If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal
of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to Borrower or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this
paragraph shall apply). Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the
extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring
a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against
Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if Borrower has
not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation.

                  (e)      If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required
to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.02(f), 2.14(d), 2.17(d), 2.18(d) or
11.03(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

                           SECTION 2.15. TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or
on account of any obligation of Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense and free
and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all Indemnified
Taxes; provided that if Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any
Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions or
withholdings (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) Borrower shall make such
deductions or withholdings and (iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
law.

                  (b)      In addition, Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c)      Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 Business Days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the basis for its claim and the calculation of
the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender or the
Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority,
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment,
a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment.

                  (e)      Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent), on or before the date it becomes a party to this
Agreement (or in the case of any Participant, on or before such Participant
purchases the related participation), such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Borrower
as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced
rate. Each Foreign Lender either (1) (i) agrees to furnish either U.S. Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or
successor form) and (ii) agrees (for the benefit of Borrower and the
Administrative Agent), to the extent it may lawfully do so at such times, upon
reasonable request by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to provide a new
Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (or successor form) upon the expiration or
obsolescence of any previously delivered form to reconfirm any complete
exemption from, or any entitlement to a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding
tax with respect to any interest payment hereunder or (2) in the case of any
such Foreign Lender that is not a "bank" within the

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Tax Code, (i) agrees to furnish either
(a) an exemption certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L and two
accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN (or successor form) or (b) an Internal Revenue Form W-8ECI (or successor
form), certifying (in each case) to such Foreign Lender's legal entitlement to
an exemption or reduction from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to all
interest payments hereunder and (ii) agrees (for the benefit of Borrower and the
Administrative Agent) to the extent it may lawfully do so at such times, upon
reasonable request by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to provide a new
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or successor form) upon the expiration or obsolescence of
any previously delivered form to reconfirm any complete exemption from, or any
entitlement to a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to any
interest payment hereunder.

                  (f)      If the Administrative Agent or a Lender (or an
assignee) receives a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which
it has been indemnified by Borrower or with respect to which Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall pay over such refund
to Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional
amounts paid, by Borrower under this Section 2.15 with respect to the
Indemnified Taxes or the Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, any Taxes imposed on such
refund to the extent in excess of any tax benefit actually realized in
connection with the payments of the tax giving rise to such refund) of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender (or assignee) and without interest (other
than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund); provided, however, that Borrower, upon the request of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender (or assignee), agrees to repay the amount
paid over to Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender
(or assignee) in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender (or assignee)
is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing
contained in this Section 2.15(f) shall require the Administrative Agent or any
Lender (or assignee) to make available its tax returns or any other information
which it deems confidential to Borrower or any other person.

                           SECTION 2.16. MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF
LENDERS.

                  (a)      MITIGATION OF OBLIGATIONS. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.12, or if Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable
efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender,
such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable in
the future pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.15, as the case may be, and (ii) would
not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
otherwise be disadvantageous in any material respect to such Lender. Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

                  (b)      REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. If (1) any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.12, (2) Borrower is required to pay any additional
amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender
pursuant to Section 2.15, (3) any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund
Loans hereunder or (4) Borrower elects to replace a Lender in accordance with
Section 11.02(c), then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice
to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in Section 11.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement to an assignee selected by Borrower that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (i) Borrower shall have received the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is being
assigned, the

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender) if the assignee is not another Lender, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees, prepayment premiums and all other amounts payable to it
hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15,
such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
(other than a de minimis amount). A Lender shall not be required to make any
such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                           SECTION 2.17. SWINGLINE LOANS.

                  (a)      SWINGLINE COMMITMENT. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans
to Borrower from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period, in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i)
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $5.0
million or (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Exposures exceeding the total
Revolving Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required
to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the
foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

                  (b)      SWINGLINE LOANS. To request a Swingline Loan,
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy), not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of
the requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the
Swingline Lender of any such notice received from Borrower. The Swingline Lender
shall make each Swingline Loan available to Borrower by means of a credit to the
general deposit account of Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case
of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
provided in Section 2.18(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan. Borrower shall
not request a Swingline Loan if at the time of and immediately after giving
effect to such request a Default has occurred and is continuing. Swingline Loans
shall be made in minimum amounts of $250,000 and integral multiples of $50,000
above such amount.

                  (c)      PREPAYMENT. Borrower shall have the right at any time
and from time to time to prepay any Swingline Loan, in whole or in part, upon
giving written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by
written or telecopy notice) to the Swingline Lender and to the Administrative
Agent before 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment at the
Swingline Lender's address for notices specified in the Swingline Lender's
Administrative Questionnaire, and such prepayments shall be made to the
Swingline Lender by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date of prepayment.
All principal payments of Swingline Loans shall be accompanied by accrued
interest on the principal amount being repaid to the date of payment.

                  (d)      PARTICIPATIONS. The Swingline Lender may by written
notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, New York
City time, on any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire
participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans
outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans
in which Revolving Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such
notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Revolving
Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such

                                      -47-

<PAGE>

Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's Pro
Rata Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in
Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence
and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever (provided that such payment shall not cause such
Lender's Revolving Exposure to exceed such Lender's Revolving Commitment). Each
Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.02(f) with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.02
shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving
Lenders) and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender
the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative
Agent shall notify Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired
pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline
Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender.
Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from Borrower (or other party on
behalf of Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the
Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be
promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the
Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this
paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The
purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall
not relieve Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

                           SECTION 2.18. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a)      GENERAL. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own
account or the account of a Subsidiary in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
during the Revolving Availability Period (provided that Borrower shall be a
co-applicant, and shall be jointly and severally liable, with respect to each
Letter of Credit issued for the account of or in favor of a Subsidiary). In the
event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or
other agreement submitted by Borrower to, or entered into by Borrower with, the
Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.

                  (b)      NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL, EXTENSION;
CERTAIN CONDITIONS. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), Borrower
shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent (at least three Business Days in advance of
the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, or such shorter
period as is acceptable to such respective Issuing Bank) a notice requesting the
issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be
amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such
Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this
Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the
beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare,
amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank,
Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's
standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of
Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, Borrower shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such

                                      -48-

<PAGE>

issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed
$15.0 million and (ii) the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total
Revolving Commitments.

                  (c)      EXPIRATION DATE. Each Letter of Credit shall expire
at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (1) in the case of a
Standby Letter of Credit, unless otherwise consented to by the Issuing Bank in
its sole discretion, (x) (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of
such Standby Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension
thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) or (ii) such later date as
requested by Borrower in the relevant application and (y) the date that is five
days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date and (2) in the case of a Commercial
Letter of Credit, (x) the date that is 180 days after the date of issuance of
such Commercial Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension
thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (y) the date that is five
days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

                  (d)      PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit
(or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and
without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender
hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to
be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such
Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank
and not reimbursed by Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of
this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to
Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation
to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e)      REIMBURSEMENT. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement by paying to the Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such
LC Disbursement is made, if Borrower shall have received notice of such LC
Disbursement prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by Borrower prior to such time on such date, then
not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that
Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately
following the day that Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not
received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that Borrower may,
subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance
with Section 2.03 or 2.17 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving
Loan or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed,
Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by
the resulting ABR Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan. If Borrower fails to make
such payment when due, the Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent
and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the
applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from Borrower in respect
thereof and such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage thereof. Promptly following
receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent its Pro Rata Percentage of the unreimbursed LC Disbursement in the same
manner as provided in Section 2.02(f), with respect to Loans made by such
Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the
amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt
by the Administrative Agent of any payment from Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall, to the extent that Revolving Lenders
have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

the Issuing Bank, distribute such payment to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank
as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant
to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other
than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated
above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                  (f)      OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The obligation of Borrower to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the obligations of Borrower hereunder.
Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of
their Affiliates, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as
opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived
by Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by Borrower that
are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining
whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply
with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence
of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank, any
other issuing bank or any of their respective correspondent banks (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank
may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.

                  (g)      DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Issuing Bank shall,
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent and Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement (other than with respect to the timing of such reimbursement
obligation set forth in Section 2.18(e)).

                  (h)      INTERIM INTEREST. If the Issuing Bank shall make any
LC Disbursement, then, unless Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at
the

                                      -50-

<PAGE>

rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that if Borrower
fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of
this Section, then Section 2.06(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to
this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that
interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be
for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

                  (i)      RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF THE ISSUING BANK. The
Issuing Bank may resign as Issuing Bank hereunder at any time upon at least 30
days' prior notice to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and Borrower. The
Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing
Bank. One or more Lenders may be appointed as additional Issuing Banks by
written agreement among Borrower, the Administrative Agent (whose consent will
not be unreasonably withheld) and the Lender that is to be so appointed. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such resignation or
replacement of the Issuing Bank or any such additional Issuing Bank. At the time
any such resignation or replacement shall become effective, Borrower shall pay
all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 2.05(c). From and after the effective date of any such resignation,
replacement or addition, as applicable, (i) the successor or additional Issuing
Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii)
references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such
successor or such addition or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
or such addition and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.
After the resignation or replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced
Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the
rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or replacement, but
shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. If at any time
there is more than one Issuing Bank hereunder, Borrower may, in its discretion,
select which Issuing Bank is to issue any particular Letter of Credit.

                  (j)      CASH COLLATERALIZATION. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of
the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing
greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash
collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in the LC
Sub-Account, in the name of the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the
Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit
such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind,
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to Borrower described
in clause (g) or (h) of Article VIII. Upon the Business Day Borrower receives
such notice, Borrower shall deposit such cash collateral in the LC Sub-Account,
to be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and performance
of the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall
have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of
withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment
of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole
discretion of the Collateral Agent and at the risk and expense of Borrower, such
deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has
been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC
Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to
satisfy other Obligations of Borrower under this Agreement. If Borrower is
required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount plus any accrued

                                      -51-

<PAGE>

interest or realized profits or such amounts (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to Borrower within three Business Days after all
Events of Default have been cured or waived.

                  (k)      ADDITIONAL ISSUING BANKS. Borrower may, at any time
and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, designate one or
more additional Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this
Agreement. Any Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph
(k) shall be deemed (in addition to being a Lender) to be the Issuing Bank with
respect to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Lender, and all
references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank"
shall, with respect to such Letters of Credit, be deemed to refer to such Lender
in its capacity as Issuing Bank, as the context shall require.

                  (l)      OTHER. The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation
to issue any Letter of Credit if:

                  (i)      any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
         Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or
         restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any
         law applicable to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether
         or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with
         jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the
         Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally
         or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing
         Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or
         capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise
         compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall
         impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense
         which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Issuing Bank
         in good faith deems material to it; or

                  (ii)     the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate
         one or more policies of the Issuing Bank.

The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if
(A) the Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter
of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of
such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of
Credit.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  Each Credit Party represents and warrants to the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and each of the
Lenders that:

                           SECTION 3.01. ORGANIZATION; POWERS. Each Company (a)
is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, (b) has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business
as now conducted, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, and (c) is qualified and in good standing (to the extent such concept is
applicable in the applicable jurisdiction) to do business in every jurisdiction
where such qualification is required, except in such jurisdictions where the
failure to so qualify, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                                      -52-

<PAGE>

                           SECTION 3.02. AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. The
Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's
powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party and constitutes, and each
other Loan Document to which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and
delivered by such Loan Party will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law and
any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

                           SECTION 3.03. GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS; NO CONFLICTS.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.03, the Transactions (a) do not require any
consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any
Governmental Authority, except (i) such as have been obtained or made and are in
full force and effect, (ii) filings necessary to perfect Liens created under the
Loan Documents and (iii) consents, approvals, registrations, filings or actions
the failure of which to obtain or perform could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, (b) will not violate the charter, by-laws
or other organizational documents of any Company or any order of any
Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate, result in a default or require any
consent or approval under any applicable law or regulation, indenture, agreement
or other instrument binding upon any Company or its assets, or give rise to a
right thereunder to require any payment to be made by any Company, except for
violations, defaults or the creation of such rights that could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (d) will not result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of any Company, except Liens
created under the Loan Documents and Permitted Liens.

                           SECTION 3.04. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) Borrower has
heretofore delivered to the Lenders the audited consolidated balance sheets and
related statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of Holdings
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries and of Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, in each case, as of and for the fiscal years ended October 3,
2003, September 27, 2002 and September 28, 2001 (the statements as of and for
the fiscal year ended October 3, 2003 referred to as the "AUDITED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS"). Such financial statements (and all financial statements delivered
pursuant to Section 5.01) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied and present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Holdings or
Borrower, as the case may be. Except as set forth in such financial statements
(and all financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01), there are no
liabilities of Holdings or any Company of any kind, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, which could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      The pro forma consolidated balance sheet and related
statements of income and cash flows of Borrower for the fiscal year ended
October 3, 2003 (the "PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") and the other pro forma
information, including pro forma EBITDA, contained in the Confidential
Information Memorandum have been prepared in good faith by the Loan Parties,
based on the assumptions stated therein (which assumptions are believed by the
Loan Parties on the date hereof and on the Closing Date to be reasonable),
accurately reflect all adjustments required to be made to give effect to the
Transactions and in the reasonable judgment of Borrower, present fairly on a pro
forma basis the estimated consolidated financial position and results of
operations of Borrower as and for such dates, assuming that the Transactions had
actually occurred at such dates or at the beginning of such periods, as
applicable.

                           SECTION 3.05. PROPERTIES. (a) Each Company has good
title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property
material to its business, except for irregularities or deficiencies in title
that, individually or in the aggregate, do not interfere in a material respect
with the

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

ability of the Companies taken as a whole to conduct their business as currently
conducted. Title to all such property held by such Company is free and clear of
all Liens except for Permitted Liens; provided, however, title to all Mortgaged
Real Property is free and clear of all Liens except for the Prior Liens. The
property of the Companies, taken as a whole, (i) is in good operating order,
condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) (except to the extent
such condition could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect) and (ii) constitutes all the properties which are required for the
business and operations of the Companies as currently conducted.

                  (b)      As of the Closing Date, Schedule 3.05(b) contains a
true and complete list of each parcel of Real Property (i) owned by any Credit
Party as of the date hereof and describes the type of interest therein held by
such Credit Party and (ii) leased, subleased or otherwise occupied or utilized
by any Credit Party, as lessee, as of the date hereof and describes the type of
interest therein held by such Credit Party and, in the case of Real Property
located in the United States, whether such lease, sublease or other instrument
requires the consent of the landlord thereunder or other parties thereto to the
Transactions.

                  (c)      Schedule 3.05(c) sets forth a list of all patents,
patent applications, registered trademarks, domain names, registered service
marks, and registered copyrights owned and necessary to such Loan Party for the
conduct of the Acquired Business as currently conducted (the "INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY"), except for those the failure to own or license which, individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. No written claim has been asserted and is pending or has been
threatened in writing against the Loan Party by any person challenging or
questioning the validity or effectiveness of or alleging infringement or other
violation of any such U.S. Intellectual Property, except as set forth in
Schedule 3.05(c). To the knowledge of each Loan Party, the use of such
Intellectual Property by each Loan Party does not infringe or otherwise violate
the intellectual property rights of any person, except for such claims,
violations, and infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired Business.

                           SECTION 3.06. EQUITY INTERESTS AND SUBSIDIARIES. (a)
Schedule 3.06(a) sets forth a list of (i) all the Subsidiaries and their
jurisdiction of organization as of the Closing Date and (ii) the number of
shares of each class of its Equity Interests authorized, and the number
outstanding, on the Closing Date and the number of shares covered by all
outstanding options, warrants, rights of conversion or purchase and similar
rights at the Closing Date. All Equity Interests of each Subsidiary are duly and
validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by Borrower. All Equity Interests of Borrower are owned directly by
Holdings and all Equity Interests of Holdings are owned directly by Parent. Each
Loan Party is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good and marketable
title to, the Equity Interests pledged by it under the Security Agreement, free
of any and all Liens, rights or claims of other persons, except for Permitted
Liens.

                  (b)      No consent of any person including any other general
or limited partner, any other member of a limited liability company, any other
shareholder or any trust beneficiary is necessary or desirable in connection
with the creation, perfection or first priority status of the security interest
of the Collateral Agent in any Equity Interests, subject only to Permitted
Liens, pledged to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties
under the Security Agreement or the exercise by the Collateral Agent of the
voting or other rights provided for in the Security Agreement or the exercise of
remedies in respect thereof.

                           SECTION 3.07. LITIGATION; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. (a)
There are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity by or before any
Governmental Authority now pending or, to the knowledge of any Company,
threatened against or affecting any Company or any business, property or rights
of any such person (i) that challenge the enforceability or validity of any Loan
Document or the

                                      -54-

<PAGE>

Transactions or (ii) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      Except for matters covered by Section 3.17, no
Company or any of its property is in violation of, nor will the continued
operation of their property as currently conducted violate, any Requirements of
Law (including any zoning or building ordinance, code or approval or any
building permits) or any restrictions of record or agreements affecting the Real
Property or is in default with respect to any judgment, writ, injunction, decree
or order of any Governmental Authority, in each case where such violation or
default could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                           SECTION 3.08. AGREEMENTS. (a) As of the Closing Date,
no Credit Party is a party to any material agreement other than the Acquisition
Documents and the agreements set forth on Schedule 3.08, and Borrower has
delivered to the Administrative Agent complete and correct copies of all such
material agreements, including any amendments, supplements or modifications with
respect thereto.

                  (b)      No Company is in default under any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property are or
may be bound (other than agreements relating to or evidencing Indebtedness)
where such default could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                           SECTION 3.09. FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS. (a) No
Company is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of buying or carrying Margin Stock.

                  (b)      No part of the proceeds of any Loan or any Letter of
Credit will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether immediately,
incidentally or ultimately, for any purpose that entails a violation of, or that
is inconsistent with, the provisions of the regulations of the Board, including
Regulation T, U or X. The pledge of the Securities Collateral (as defined in the
Security Agreement) pursuant to the Security Agreement does not violate such
regulations.

                           SECTION 3.10. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANY ACT. No Company is (a) an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company," as defined in, or subject to regulation
under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (b) a "holding
company," an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company," as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

                           SECTION 3.11. USE OF PROCEED. Borrower will use the
proceeds of (a) the Term Loans to finance a portion of the Merger (through the
making of the Closing Date Intercompany Loan), effect the Refinancing and pay
fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions and (b) the Revolving
Loans following the Closing Date to provide ongoing working capital requirements
and for general corporate purposes. Borrower may also use the proceeds of the
Revolving Loans on the Closing Date to fund up to $4.0 million to provide
ongoing working capital requirements. All of the proceeds from the Equity
Financing will be used to fund the Transactions (other than the Refinancing,
except with respect to the Wells Fargo Agreement). All of the proceeds from the
Closing Date Intercompany Loan will be used to fund the Merger consideration and
to pay fees, commissions and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

                           SECTION 3.12. TAXES. Each Company has (a) filed or
caused to be filed all material federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns
required to be filed by it and (b) duly paid or caused

                                      -55-

<PAGE>

to be duly paid all Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) due and
payable by it and all assessments received by it, except taxes (i) that are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which such
Company shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with
GAAP or which could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) with respect to taxable periods or portions thereof
ending on or prior to the date of the Latest Balance Sheet for which it has made
appropriate provision in the Latest Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP.

                           SECTION 3.13. NO MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS. The
information, reports, financial statements, exhibits and schedules furnished by
or on behalf of any Company to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
connection with the negotiation of any Loan Document or included therein or
delivered pursuant thereto (including the Confidential Information Memorandum)
when taken as a whole does not contain any material misstatement of fact and
does not omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were, are or will be
made, not misleading as of the date such information is dated or certified;
provided that to the extent any such information, report, financial statement,
exhibit or schedule was based upon or constitutes a forecast or projection or
pro forma adjustment, each Company represents only that it acted in good faith
and utilized reasonable assumptions and due care in the preparation of such
information, report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule, it being
understood that projections are subject to uncertainties and contingencies and
that no assurance can be given that any projection will be realized.

                           SECTION 3.14. LABOR MATTERS. As of the Closing Date,
there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against any Company pending or, to
the knowledge of any Company, threatened which could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The hours worked by and payments made to
employees of any Company have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards
Act or any other applicable federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with
such matters in any manner which could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. All payments due from any Company, or for which any
claim may be made against any Company, on account of wages and employee health
and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a
liability on the books of such Company except where the failure to do so could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The
consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination
or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective
bargaining agreement to which any Company is bound.

                           SECTION 3.15. SOLVENCY. Immediately after the
consummation of the Transactions to occur on the Closing Date and immediately
following the making of each Loan and after giving effect to the application of
the proceeds of each Loan, (a) the fair value of the assets of each Loan Party
will exceed its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise;
(b) the present fair saleable value of the property of each Loan Party will be
greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of
its debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c) each Loan Party
will be able to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) no
Loan Party will have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the
business in which it is engaged as such business is now conducted and is
proposed to be conducted following the Closing Date.

                           SECTION 3.16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Each
Company and its ERISA Affiliates are in compliance with the applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Tax Code and the regulations and published
interpretations thereunder except where the failure to comply could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No ERISA Event has
occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all
other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all
underfunded

                                      -56-

<PAGE>

Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent
financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair market value of
the assets of all such underfunded Plans by an amount that would have a Material
Adverse Effect. In the event of a complete withdrawal from each Multiemployer
Plan, the aggregate liabilities of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates
resulting therefrom could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      Each Foreign Plan has been maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable
laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been maintained, where
required, in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities, except where
the failure to comply or be maintained in good standing could not be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Company has incurred any
obligation in connection with the termination of or withdrawal from any Foreign
Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
The present value of the accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested)
under each Foreign Plan which is required to be funded, determined as of the end
of the most recently ended fiscal year of the respective Company (based on the
actuarial assumptions used for purposes of the applicable jurisdiction's
financial reporting requirements), did not exceed the current value of the
assets of such Foreign Plan by an amount that could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, and for each Foreign Plan which is not funded,
the obligations of such Foreign Plan are properly accrued, except where the
failure to comply could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                           SECTION 3.17. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. (a) The Real
Property of the Companies does not contain therein, thereon or thereunder,
including, without limitation, the soil and groundwater thereunder, any
Hazardous Materials in amounts or concentrations which (i) constitute a
violation of, (ii) require a Response under, or (iii) could give rise to
liability under, Environmental Laws, which violations, Response and liabilities,
in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect;

                  (b)      The Real Property and all operations of the Companies
are in compliance, and in the last three years have been in compliance, with all
Environmental Laws and all necessary Environmental Permits have been obtained
and are in effect, except to the extent that such non-compliance or failure to
obtain any necessary Environmental Permits, in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (c)      There have been no Releases at, from, under, or
originating from properties adjacent to, the Real Property or otherwise in
connection with the operations of any Company, which Releases, in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (d)      None of the Companies has received an Environmental
Claim, nor to their knowledge has any been threatened, which, in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

conduct any Response in accordance with Environmental Laws; provided, however,
that no Company shall be required to undertake any Response to the extent that
its obligation to do so is being contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings and appropriate reserves are being maintained with respect to such
circumstances in accordance with GAAP.

                  (b)      If a Default caused by reason of a breach of Section
3.17 or Section 5.09(a) shall have occurred and be continuing for more than 20

         of all leases in which any Group Company holds the lessor's interest or
         other agreements relating to possessory interests of any Group Company,
         if any. To the extent any of the foregoing encumber any Mortgaged Real
         Property, such agreement shall be subordinate to the Lien of the
         Mortgage to be recorded against such Mortgaged Real Property, either
         expressly by its terms or pursuant to a subordination, non-disturbance
         and attornment agreement;

                  (G)      with respect to each Mortgaged Real Property, each
         Group Company shall have made all notifications, registrations and

The Mortgages and instruments related thereto shall be duly recorded or filed in
such manner and in such places as are required by law to establish, perfect,
preserve and protect the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent required to be
granted pursuant to the Mortgages and all taxes, fees and other charges due and
payable in connection therewith shall be paid in full. Such Credit Party shall
otherwise take such actions and execute and/or deliver to the Collateral Agent
such documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably require to confirm
the validity, perfection and priority of the Lien of any existing Mortgage or
new Mortgage against such after-acquired Real Property within 60 days after
prompt notice of the acquisition of such after-acquired Real Property is
provided to the Collateral Agent.

                           SECTION 5.12. SECURITY INTERESTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES.
Each Credit Party shall, at its own cost and expense, take any and all actions
necessary to defend title to the Collateral against all persons and to defend
the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral and the priority
thereof against any Lien not expressly permitted pursuant to Section 6.02 of the
Credit Agreement. Promptly, upon the reasonable request of the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agent, at Borrower's expense, execute, acknowledge and
deliver, or cause the execution, acknowledgment and delivery of, and thereafter
register, file or record, or cause to be registered, filed or recorded, in an
appropriate governmental office, any document or instrument supplemental to or
confirmatory of the Collateral Documents or otherwise deemed by Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agent reasonably necessary or desirable for the
continued validity, perfection and priority of the Liens on the Collateral
covered thereby superior to and prior to the rights of all third persons other
than the holders of Permitted Liens and subject to other Liens except as

         to Borrower or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Borrower and (ii) if such
         Subsidiary is not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Borrower, may pay cash
         Dividends to its shareholders generally so long as Borrower or its
         Subsidiary which owns the equity interest or interests in the
         Subsidiary paying such Dividends receives at least its proportionate
         share thereof (based upon its relative holdings of equity interests in
         the Subsidiary paying such Dividends and taking into account the
         relative preferences, if any, of the various classes of equity
         interests in such Subsidiary);

                  (b)      so long as no Default exists or would result
         therefrom, Borrower may pay Dividends to Holdings for the purpose of
         paying Dividends to Parent in order to enable Parent to repurchase

         capital stock) following the death, disability, retirement or
         termination of employment of employees, officers or directors of any
         Company or upon the exercise by any such person of any "put" right in
         respect of any such capital stock (or options); provided that the
         aggregate amount of Dividends paid by Borrower pursuant to this
         paragraph (b) shall not exceed an aggregate amount of $3.0 million
         (exclusive of any amounts repaid to Borrower concurrently therewith in
         respect of loans made pursuant to Section 6.03(j);

                  (c)      Borrower may pay cash Dividends to Holdings for the
         purpose of paying cash Dividends to Parent, so long as all proceeds
         thereof are promptly used by Parent to pay its franchise taxes and
         operating expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and
         other corporate overhead costs and expenses (including legal and
         accounting expenses and similar expenses and customary fees to
         non-officer directors of Parent); provided that the aggregate amount of
         Dividends paid to Holdings pursuant to this clause (c) shall not exceed
         $1.0 million in any fiscal year of Parent;

                  (d)      Borrower or any Subsidiary may pay cash Dividends to
         Holdings for the purpose of paying cash dividends to Parent in an
         amount not in excess of the federal and state (in such states that
         permit consolidated or combined tax returns) income tax liability that
         Borrower and the Subsidiaries would have been liable for if any of the
         Companies had filed their taxes on a stand-alone basis, for the purpose
         of paying such taxes; provided that such payments shall be made by
         Parent no earlier than five days prior to the date on which Parent is
         required to make its payments to the Internal Revenue Service, as
         applicable;

                  (e)      Borrower may pay Dividends to Holdings for the
         purpose of paying dividends to Parent of capital stock of Parent to the
         extent such capital stock of Parent is acquired by Borrower as a result
         of a foreclosure action following a default on an advance, loan and/or
         other extension of credit permitted pursuant to Section 6.03(j); and

                  (f)      Borrower may pay Dividends to the extent permitted by

into, directly or indirectly, any transaction or series of related transactions,
whether or not in the ordinary course of business, with any Affiliate of any
Company (other than between or among Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors),
other than on terms and conditions substantially as favorable to such Company as
would reasonably be obtained by such Company at that time in a comparable
arm's-length transaction with a person other than an Affiliate, except that:

                  (a)      Dividends may be paid to the extent provided in
         Section 6.05;

                  (b)      loans may be made and other transactions may be

                  (d)      Borrower or any Subsidiary may make payments to
         Holdings pursuant to a Tax Sharing Agreement; provided that such
         payments otherwise meet the requirements for Dividends paid in
         accordance with Section 6.05(d);

                  (e)      the Transactions may be effected;

                  (f)      transfers of cash and assets to Borrower or any
         Subsidiary Guarantor may be made;

         be made with and compensation may be paid to the officers, directors,
         employees or consultants of any Company;

                  (h)      payments (in the form of Dividends or otherwise) of
         cash amounts received by any Group Company under any escrow agreements
         entered into under the Merger Agreement that do not constitute Escrow
         Proceeds may be made to Holdings or any of its Affiliates; and

                  (i)      the sale-leaseback transaction between Borrower and
         Holdings relating to the San Carlos Facility may be unwound.

                                    GUARANTEE

                           SECTION 7.01. THE GUARANTEE. The Guarantors hereby
jointly and severally guarantee as a primary obligor and not as a surety to each
Secured Party and their respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in
full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the
principal of and interest (including any interest, fees, costs or charges that
would accrue but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code after any bankruptcy
or insolvency petition under the Bankruptcy Code) on the Loans made by the
Lenders to, and the Notes held by each Lender of, Borrower, and all other
Obligations from time to time owing to the Secured Parties by any Credit Party
under any Loan Document or Interest Rate Protection Agreement relating to the
Loans, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof (such
obligations being herein collectively called the "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS"). The
Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree that if Borrower or other
Guarantor(s) shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantors
will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in
the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at
extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of
such extension or renewal.

                           SECTION 7.02. OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The
obligations of the Guarantors under Section 7.01 shall constitute a guaranty of
payment and are absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, joint and several,
irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability
of the Guaranteed Obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes, if
any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any
substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any
of the Guaranteed Obligations and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or Guarantor
(except for payment in full). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not
alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder, which shall remain
absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances as
described above:

                                      -87-

<PAGE>

                  (i)      at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         the Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any
         of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or
         compliance shall be waived;

                  (ii)     any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or
         instrument referred to herein or therein shall be done or omitted;

                  (iii)    the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
         shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be
         amended in any respect, or any right under the Loan Documents or any
         other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be
         amended or waived in any respect or any other guarantee of any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or
         exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

                  (iv)     any Lien or security interest granted to, or in favor
         of, Issuing Bank or any Lender or Agent as security for any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected; or

                  (v)      the release of any other Guarantor.

                  The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that
any Credit Party exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against Borrower
under this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument
referred to herein or therein, or against any other person under any other
guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantors
waive any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension, waiver,
termination or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or
proof of reliance by any Secured Party upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this
Guarantee, and the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively
be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this
Guarantee, and all dealings between Borrower and the Secured Parties shall
likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance
upon this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing,
absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to
any right of offset with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations at any time or
from time to time held by the Secured Parties, and the obligations and
liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be conditioned or contingent
upon the pursuit by the Secured Parties or any other person at any time of any
right or remedy against Borrower or against any other person which may be or
become liable in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or
against any collateral or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect
thereto. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in
accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantors and the
successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Lenders,
and their respective successors and assigns, notwithstanding that from time to
time during the term of this Agreement there may be no Guaranteed Obligations
outstanding.

                           SECTION 7.03. REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of the
Guarantors under this Article VII shall be automatically reinstated if and to
the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of a Credit Party in
respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored
by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any
proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise. The Guarantors jointly
and severally agree that they will indemnify each Secured Party on demand for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred by such Secured Party in connection with such rescission or
restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against
any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent
transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy,

                                      -88-

<PAGE>

insolvency or similar law, other than any costs or expenses resulting from the
gross negligence or bad faith or willful misconduct of such Secured Party.

                           SECTION 7.04. SUBROGATION; SUBORDINATION. Each
Guarantor hereby agrees that until the payment and satisfaction in full in cash
of all Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the
Commitments of the Lenders under this Agreement it shall not exercise any right
or remedy arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section
7.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against Borrower or any other
Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the
Guaranteed Obligations. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any
indebtedness of Borrower or any other Guarantor now or hereafter owing to any
Guarantor or Borrower by reason of any payment by such Guarantor under the
Guarantee in this Article VII is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in
full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition, any Indebtedness of the
Guarantors now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated in
right of payment in full in cash to the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor
agrees that it will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such
indebtedness of Borrower to such Guarantor until the Obligations shall have been
paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any Guarantor
shall prior to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations
collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness, such
amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee
for the Secured Parties and be paid over to Administrative Agent on account of
the Guaranteed Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of such
Guarantor under the other provisions of the guaranty contained herein. Any
Indebtedness of any Loan Party permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(d) shall be
subordinated to such Loan Party's Obligations in the manner set forth in the
Intercompany Note evidencing such Indebtedness.

                           SECTION 7.05. REMEDIES. The Guarantors jointly and
severally agree that, as between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations
of Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes, if any, may be declared to be
forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VIII (and shall be deemed to
have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said
Article VIII) for purposes of Section 7.01, notwithstanding any stay, injunction
or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from
becoming automatically due and payable) as against Borrower and that, in the
event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable
by Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for
purposes of Section 7.01.

                           SECTION 7.06. INSTRUMENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONEY.
Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article VII
constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that
any Lender or Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such
Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to
bring a motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213 to the extent permitted
thereunder.

                           SECTION 7.07. GENERAL LIMITATION ON GUARANTEE
OBLIGATIONS. In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or
any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any
Subsidiary Guarantor under Section 7.01 would otherwise be held or determined to
be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of
any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section
7.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the amount of
such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor, any other
Credit Party or any other person, be automatically limited and reduced to the
highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims
of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding.

         otherwise;

         same shall become due and payable, and such default shall continue
         unremedied for a period of five Business Days;

         statement or information contained in any certificate furnished in
         connection with or pursuant to any Loan Document, shall prove to have

         holder or holders of such Indebtedness or a representative on its or
         their behalf (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time
         or both) to cause, such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated

         Indebtedness referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) exceeds $5.0 million
         at any one time;

         seeking to establish the invalidity or unenforceability thereof
         (exclusive of questions of interpretation of any provision thereof), or

Holdings or Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) above), and at any time
thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may,
and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to Borrower, take
either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i)
terminate forthwith the Commitments and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding
to be forthwith due and payable in whole or in part, whereupon the principal of
the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest
thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of Borrower
accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document, shall become forthwith due
and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower and the Guarantors,
anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary
notwithstanding; and in any event with respect to Parent, Holdings or Borrower
described in paragraph (g) or (h) above, the Commitments shall automatically
terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued
interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of
Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document, shall
automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
Borrower and the Guarantors, anything contained herein or in any other Loan
Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

                                   ARTICLE IX

             COLLATERAL ACCOUNT; APPLICATION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS

                           SECTION 9.01. COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. (a) The Collateral
Agent is hereby authorized to establish and maintain at its office at 677
Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901, in the name of the Collateral
Agent and pursuant to a Control Agreement (to the extent requested), a
restricted deposit account designated "Collateral Account". Each Credit Party
shall deposit into the Collateral Account from time to time (i) the cash
proceeds of any of the Collateral (including pursuant to any disposition
thereof) to the extent contemplated herein or in any other Loan Document, (ii)
the cash proceeds of any Casualty Event with respect to Collateral to the extent
contemplated herein or in any other Loan Document, and (iii) any cash such
Credit Party is required to pledge as additional collateral security hereunder
pursuant to the Loan Documents.

                  (b)      The balance from time to time in the Collateral
Account shall constitute part of the Collateral and shall not constitute payment
of the Obligations until applied as hereinafter provided. So long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing or will result therefrom, the Collateral
Agent shall, within one Business Day's of receiving a request of the applicable
Credit Party for release of cash proceeds constituting (i) Net Cash Proceeds
from the Collateral Account, remit such cash proceeds on deposit in the
Collateral Account to or upon the order of such Credit Party, so long as such
Credit Party has satisfied the conditions relating thereto set forth in Section
9.02, (ii) Net Cash Proceeds from any sale or other disposition of Collateral
from the Collateral Account, remit such cash proceeds on deposit in the
Collateral Account, so long as such Credit Party has satisfied the conditions
relating thereto set forth in Section 9.02 and (iii) with respect to the LC
Sub-Account at such time as all Letters of Credit shall have been terminated and
all of the liabilities in respect of the Letters of Credit have been paid in
full. At any time following the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may (and, if instructed by the Required
Lenders as specified herein, shall) in its (or their) discretion apply and
provide notice to Borrower of such application or cause to be applied (subject
to collection) the balance from time to time outstanding to the credit of the
Collateral Account to the payment of the Obligations in the manner specified in
Section 9.03 hereof, subject, however, in the case of amounts deposited in the
LC Sub-Account, to the provisions of Sections 2.18(j) and 9.03. The Credit
Parties shall have no right to withdraw, transfer or otherwise receive any funds
deposited in the Collateral Account except to the extent specifically provided
herein.

                                      -92-

<PAGE>

                  (c)      Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be
invested from time to time in Cash Equivalents as the applicable Credit Party
(or, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Collateral Agent) shall determine, which Cash Equivalents shall be held in the
name and be under the control of the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent);
provided that at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may (and, if instructed by the Required
Lenders as specified herein, shall) in its (or their) discretion at any time and
from time to time elect to liquidate any such Cash Equivalents and to apply or
cause to be applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Obligations in
the manner specified in Section 9.03 hereof.

                  (d)      Amounts deposited into the Collateral Account as
cover for liabilities in respect of Letters of Credit under any provision of
this Agreement requiring such cover shall be held by the Collateral Agent in a
separate sub-account designated as the "LC Sub-Account" (the "LC SUB-ACCOUNT").

                           SECTION 9.02. PROCEEDS OF CASUALTY EVENTS. (a) So
long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in the event
there shall be any Net Cash Proceeds in respect of any Casualty Event, the
applicable Credit Party shall have the right, at such Credit Party's option, to
apply such Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Agreement.

                  (b)      In the event any Net Cash Proceeds are required to be
deposited in the Collateral Account in accordance with Section 2.10(f), the
Collateral Agent shall not release any part of such Net Cash Proceeds until the
applicable Credit Party has furnished to the Collateral Agent (i) an Officers'
Certificate setting forth: (A) a brief description of the reason for the
release, (B) the dollar amount of the expenditures to be made, or costs incurred
by such Credit Party in connection with such release and (C) each request for
payment shall be made on at least one Business Day's prior notice to the
Collateral Agent and such request shall state that the properties acquired in
connection with such release have a fair market value at least equal to the
amount of such Net Cash Proceeds requested to be released from the Collateral
Account and (ii) all security agreements and Mortgages and other items required
by the provisions of Sections 5.11 and 5.12 to, among other things, subject such
reinvestment properties or assets to the Lien of the Security Documents in favor
of the Collateral Agent, for its benefit and for the benefit of the other
Secured Parties.

                           SECTION 9.03. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds
received by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from or
other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the
exercise by the Collateral Agent of its remedies shall be applied, together with
any other sums then held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement,
promptly by the Collateral Agent as follows:

                  (a)      First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and
         expenses, fees, commissions and taxes of such sale, collection or other
         realization including, without limitation, compensation to the
         Collateral Agent and its agents and counsel, and all expenses,
         liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Collateral Agent in
         connection therewith, together with interest on each such amount at the
         highest rate then in effect under this Agreement from and after the
         date such amount is due, owing or unpaid until paid in full;

                  (b)      Second, to the payment of all other reasonable costs
         and expenses of such sale, collection or other realization, including,
         without limitation, compensation to the other Secured Parties and their
         agents and counsel and all costs, liabilities and advances made or
         incurred by the other Secured Parties in connection therewith, together
         with interest on each such amount at the highest rate then in effect
         under this Agreement from and after the date such amount is due, owing
         or unpaid until paid in full;

                                      -93-

<PAGE>

                  (c)      Third, without duplication of amounts applied
         pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above, to the payment in full in cash,
         pro rata, of (i) interest, principal and other amounts constituting
         Obligations (other than the Related Hedging Obligations) owing to the
         Secured Parties, in each case equally and ratably in accordance with
         the respective amounts thereof then due and owing and (ii) Related
         Hedging Obligations in accordance with the terms of the applicable
         Hedging Agreements; and

                  (d)      Fourth, the balance, if any, to the person lawfully
         entitled thereto (including the applicable Credit Party or its
         successors or assigns).

                  In the event that any such proceeds are insufficient to pay in
full the items described in clauses (a) through (c) of this Section 9.03, the
Loan Parties shall remain liable for any deficiency.

                                    ARTICLE X

                THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

                           SECTION 10.01. APPOINTMENT. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably designates and appoints each of the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent as an agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents. Each Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent, in such capacity,
through its agents or employees, to take such actions on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to such Agent by the
terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions
and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                           SECTION 10.02. AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Each
person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in
its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though
it were not an Agent, and such person and its Affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower
or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent
hereunder.

                           SECTION 10.03. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. No Agent shall
have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall
be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take
any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents
that such Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or
such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 11.02), and (c) except as expressly set
forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose or shall
be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the person
serving as such Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. No Agent shall
be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section
11.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. No
Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written
notice thereof is given to such Agent by Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent
shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any
statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan
Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document
delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or

                                      -94-

<PAGE>

document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or
elsewhere in any Loan Document.

                           SECTION 10.04. RELIANCE BY AGENT. Each Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any
notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other
writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by a proper
person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by a proper person, and shall not incur
any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel
(who may be counsel for Borrower), independent accountants and other advisors
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or advisors.

                           SECTION 10.05. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. Each Agent may
perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through
any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Affiliates. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Affiliates of each Agent
and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as
well as activities as Agent.

                           SECTION 10.06. SUCCESSOR AGENT. Each Agent may resign
as such at any time upon at least 30 days' prior notice to the Lenders, the
Issuing Bank and Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall
have the right, with the consent of Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), to appoint a successor Agent from among the Lenders; provided, that no
consent of Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent with the consent of
Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), which successor shall be
a commercial banking institution organized under the laws of the United States
(or any State thereof) or a United States branch or agency of a commercial
banking institution, in each case, having combined capital and surplus of at
least $250 million; provided, that no consent of Borrower shall be required if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided, further that if
such retiring Agent is unable to find a commercial banking institution which is
willing to accept such appointment and which meets the qualifications set forth
above, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the
Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Agent.

                  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as an Agent hereunder
by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees
payable by Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to
its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor.
After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article X and
Section 11.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent,
its sub-agents and their respective Affiliates in respect of any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.

                           SECTION 10.07. NON-RELIANCE ON AGENT AND OTHER
LENDERS. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and

                                      -95-

<PAGE>

without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make
its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                           SECTION 10.08. NO OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The
Lenders identified in this Agreement and the Syndication Agent and the
Documentation Agent shall not have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all
Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, the Syndication Agent and the
Documentation Agent shall not have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship
with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect
to the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent as it makes with respect to
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender in this Article X. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that the Syndication Agent and the
Documentation Agent hold such titles in name only, and that such titles confer
no additional rights or obligations relative to those conferred on any Lender
hereunder.

                           SECTION 10.09. INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders severally
agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not
reimbursed by a Credit Party and without limiting the obligation of the Credit
Parties to do so), ratably according to their respective outstanding Loans and
Commitments in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this
Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which all
Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans and other Obligations shall have
been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such outstanding Loans and
Commitments as in effect immediately prior to such date), from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that
may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans and other
Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the
other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or
therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken
or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  (c)      if to a Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy
         number) set forth on the applicable Lender Addendum or in the
         Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which such Lender shall have
         become a party hereto.

                  All notices and other communications given to any party hereto
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
given on the date of receipt if delivered by hand or overnight courier service
or sent by telecopy or by certified or registered mail, in each case delivered,
sent or mailed (properly addressed) to such party as provided in this Section
11.01 or in accordance with the latest unrevoked direction from such party given
in accordance with this Section 11.01 and failure to deliver courtesy copies of
notices and other communications shall in no event affect the validity or
effectiveness of such notices and other communications.

                           SECTION 11.02. WAIVERS; AMENDMENT. (a) No failure or
delay by any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of each Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Credit
Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may
have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                  (b)      Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document
nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except,
in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other
Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by
the Administrative Agent and the Credit Party or Credit Parties that are parties
thereto, in each case with the written consent of the Required Lenders, provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of

                                      -97-

<PAGE>

any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce or forgive
the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of
interest thereon, or reduce any Fees payable hereunder, without the written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the maturity of any
Loan, or any scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Term Loan
under Section 2.09, or the required date of reimbursement of any LC
Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable
hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or
postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment or postpone the
scheduled date of expiration of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving
Maturity Date, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv)
change Section 2.14(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing
of payments or set-offs required thereby without the written consent of each
Lender, (v) change the percentage set forth in the definition of "Required
Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document (including this Section)
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class)
required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent thereunder without the written consent of
each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release any
Guarantor from its Guarantee, or limit its liability in respect of such
Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii) release all or
substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents or
alter the relative priorities of the Obligations entitled to the Liens of the
Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional Obligations
equally and ratably with the other Obligations), in each case without the
written consent of each Lender, or (viii) change any provisions of any Loan
Document in a manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect
of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any Class differently than those
holding Loans of any other Class without the written consent of Lenders holding
a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each
affected Class; provided, further, that (1) no such agreement shall amend,
modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing
Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, (2) any waiver, amendment or
modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties
under this Agreement of the Revolving Lenders (but not the Term Lenders) or the
Term Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or
agreements in writing entered into by Borrower and requisite percentage in
interest of the affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent
thereto under this Section if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of
Lenders hereunder at the time, and (3) any waiver, amendment or modification
prior to the earlier of (i) the date which is 30 days after the Closing Date and
(ii) the date of the successful completion of the syndication of the Loans and
Commitments (as determined by the Joint Lead Arrangers) may not be effected
without the written consent of the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in
writing entered into by Borrower, the Required Lenders and the Administrative
Agent (and, if their rights or obligations are affected thereby, the Issuing
Bank and the Swingline Lender) if (x) by the terms of such agreement the
Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein
shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and (y) at the time
such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives
payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it
and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this
Agreement.

                  (c)      If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver,
discharge or termination of any of the provisions of this Agreement as
contemplated by Section 11.02(b) (other than clause (iii) of such Section), the
consent of the Supermajority Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more
of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained, then Borrower
shall have the right to replace any of such non-consenting Lenders with one or
more persons pursuant to Section 2.16 so long as at the time of such replacement
each such new Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination.

                           SECTION 11.03. EXPENSES; INDEMNITY. (a) The Loan
Parties agree, jointly and severally, to pay, promptly upon demand:

                  (i)      all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
         Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline
         Lender and the Issuing Bank, including the reasonable fees, charges and
         disbursements of Advisors for the Arranger, the Administrative Agent,
         the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank, in
         connection with the syndication of the Loans and Commitments, the
         preparation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the
         administration of the Loans and Commitments, the perfection and
         maintenance of the Liens securing the Collateral and any actual or
         proposed amendment, supplement or waiver of any of the Loan Documents
         (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall
         be consummated);

                  (ii)     all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
         Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, including the reasonable
         fees, charges and disbursements of Advisors for the Administrative
         Agent and the Collateral Agent, in connection with any action, suit or
         other proceeding affecting the Collateral or any part thereof, in which
         action, suit or proceeding the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
         Agent is made a party or participates or in which the right to use the
         Collateral or any part thereof is threatened, or in which it becomes
         necessary in the judgment of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
         Agent to defend or uphold the Liens granted by the Security Documents
         (including any action, suit or proceeding to establish or uphold the
         compliance of the Collateral with any Requirements of Law);

                  (iii)    all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
         Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline
         Lender, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the reasonable fees,
         charges and disbursements of Advisors for the Arranger, the
         Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender, the
         Issuing Bank or any Lender, incurred in connection with the enforcement
         or protection of its rights under the Loan Documents, including its
         rights under this Section 11.03(a), or in connection with the Loans
         made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder and the collection of the
         Obligations, including all such costs and expenses incurred during any
         workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of the Obligations;
         and

                  (iv)     all documentary and similar taxes and charges in
         respect of the Loan Documents.

For purposes of this Section 11.03(a), "ADVISORS" shall mean legal counsel
(including local counsel), auditors, accountants, consultants, appraisers or
other advisors; provided that (x) in the case of clause (i), the engagement of
any Advisors other than legal counsel (including local counsel) shall be subject
to approval by Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and
(y) in the case of clause (iii), the engagement of any Advisors other than one
firm of legal counsel by any Lender shall be subject to approval by the
Administrative Agent.

                  (b)      The Credit Parties agree, jointly and severally, to
indemnify the Agents, each Lender, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender,
each Affiliate of any of the foregoing persons and each of their respective
partners, controlling persons, directors, officers, trustees, employees and
agents (each such person being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and to hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, penalties, judgments, suits and related
expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements, incurred
by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with,
or as a result of (i) the execution, delivery, performance, administration or
enforcement of the Loan Documents, (ii) any actual or proposed use of the
proceeds of the Loans or issuance of Letters of Credit, (iii) any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto, or

                                      -99-

<PAGE>

(iv) any actual or alleged presence or Release or threatened Release of
Hazardous Materials, on, under or from any property owned, leased or operated by
any Group Company, or any Environmental Claim related in any way to any Group
Company; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee.

                  (c)      The provisions of this Section 11.03 shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term
of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans or other Obligations, the expiration of the
Commitments, the expiration of any Letter of Credit, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents, the Issuing
Bank, the Swingline Lender or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section
11.03 shall be payable on written demand therefor accompanied by reasonable
documentation with respect to any reimbursement, indemnification or other amount
requested.

                  (d)      To the extent that Borrower fails to promptly pay any
amount required to be paid by it to the Agents, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Agents, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender,
as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that
the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such
unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss,
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against any of the Agents, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender
in its capacity as such provided further, however, that to the extent any
Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender is entitled to indemnification under this
Section 11.03, to the extent such indemnification relates solely to such Issuing
Bank's or such Swingline Lender's acting in such capacity the indemnification
provided for in this Section 11.03 will be the obligation solely of the
Revolving Lenders. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be
determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Exposure,
outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments at the time.

                           SECTION 11.04. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
(including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit),
except that no Credit Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent and each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Credit
Party without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
(including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit)
and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Affiliates of each of the
Agents, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender and the Lenders) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b)      Any Lender shall have the right at any time to assign
to one or more banks, insurance companies, investment companies or funds or
other institutions (other than any Group Company or any Affiliate thereof) all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all
or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided
that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
Lender or a Lender Affiliate, each of Borrower and the Administrative Agent
(and, in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Revolving Commitment
or any Lender's obligations in respect of its LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure,
the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender) must give their prior written consent
to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of
a

                                      -100-

<PAGE>

Lender or a Lender Affiliate, any assignment made in connection with the primary
syndication of the Commitment and Loans by the Joint Lead Arrangers or an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment
or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject
to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall
not be less than (x) in the case of Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans,
$1.0 million, and (y) in the case of Term Loan Commitments and Term Loans, $1.0
million unless each of Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent
(provided that substantially contemporaneous assignments to an assignee and one
or more of its Lender Affiliates shall be aggregated for purposes of such
minimum assignment amounts), (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, except that this clause (iii) shall not be
construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments
or Loans, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500 (except that such fee will not be payable with
respect to an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate), and (v) the
assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
an Administrative Questionnaire; and provided, further, that any consent of
Borrower otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be required (1) if an
Event of Default under Article VIII has occurred and is continuing or (2) prior
to the earlier of (x) the date which is 30 days after the Closing Date and (y)
date on which a successful syndication of the Loans and Commitments shall have
been declared by the Joint Lead Arrangers; provided, however, that in the case
of clause (2), Borrower shall have the consultation rights with respect to
syndication of the Loans as set forth in the Commitment Letter. Subject to
acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from
and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a
Lender under this Agreement (provided that any liability of Borrower to such
assignee under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15 shall be limited to the amount, if
any, that would have been payable thereunder by Borrower in the absence of such
assignment, except to the extent any such amounts are attributable to a Change
in Law occurring after the date of such assignment), and the assigning Lender
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12,
2.13, 2.15 and 11.03).

                  (c)      the Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as
an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error, and Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each person
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available
for inspection by Borrower, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent, the
Swingline Lender and any Lender (with respect to its own interest only), at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d)      Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
(b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement

                                      -101-

<PAGE>

unless (i) it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph or
(ii) the original Note evidencing the assigned Loan (or portion thereof), if
any, is returned to the Borrower marked "cancelled" and one or more new Notes
are issued to the assignee, if requested by the assignee and the assigning
Lender, if necessary.

                  (e)      Any Lender shall have the right at any time, without
the consent of Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender, to sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of the first
proviso to Section 11.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph
(f) of this Section, Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender, provided
that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.14(c) as though it were
a Lender. Each Lender shall, acting for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower, maintain at one of its offices a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of its Participants, and the amount and terms of its
participations, provided that no Lender shall be required to disclose or share
the information contained in such register with the Borrower or any other party,
except as required by applicable law.

                  (f)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
such Participant. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless Borrower is
notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of Borrower, to comply with Section 2.15(e) and (f) as
though it were a Lender.

                  (g)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank
loans, such Lender may, without the consent of or notice to the Borrower or
Administrative Agent, collaterally assign or pledge all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement, including the Loans and Notes or any other
instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender under this Agreement, to any holder
of, trustee for, or any other representative of holders of, obligations owed or
securities issued, by such fund, as security for such obligations or securities.

                           SECTION 11.05. SURVIVAL OF AGREEMENT. All covenants,
agreements, representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties in the
Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in
connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and de-

                                      -102-

<PAGE>

livery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any
Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and
so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of
Sections 2.12, 2.14, 2.15 and 11.03 and Article X shall survive and remain in
full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans or the other Obligations, the
expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the
termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                           SECTION 11.06. COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION;
EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different
parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an
original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Fee Letter constitute
the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written,
relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of
the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

                           SECTION 11.07. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this
Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

                           SECTION 11.08. RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its
Affiliates are hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and
other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the
credit or the account of Borrower against any of and all the obligations of
Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each
Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

                           SECTION 11.09. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT
TO SERVICE OF PROCESS.

                  (a)      This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the law of the State of New York.

                  (b)      Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevoca-

                                      -103-

<PAGE>

bly and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document against any Credit Party or its properties in the
courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c)      Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this
Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                  (d)      Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.01. Nothing
in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable
law.

                           SECTION 11.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY
HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY
OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                           SECTION 11.11. HEADINGS. Article and Section headings
and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are
not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                           SECTION 11.12. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Agents,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to
such Agent's and such Lender's Affiliates and their directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors
(it being understood that the persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep
such Information confidential pursuant to the terms hereof), (ii) to the extent
requested by any regulatory authority or any quasi-regulatory authority
(including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (iii) to the
extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar
legal process, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement, (v) in connection with
the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of
rights hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (A) any assignee
of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement or

                                      -104-

<PAGE>

(B) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or
derivative transaction relating to Borrower and its obligations, (vii) with the
written consent of Borrower, (viii) to the extent such Information (A) is
publicly available at the time of disclosure or becomes publicly available other
than as a result of a breach of this Section or (B) becomes available to any
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than Borrower or any Subsidiary or (ix) to any direct or indirect
contractual counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual counterparty's
advisor (so long as such contractual counterparty or advisor to such contractual
counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 11.12). For
the purposes of this Section, "INFORMATION" means all information received from
any Group Company relating to any Group Company or its business that is clearly
identified at the time of delivery as confidential, other than any such
information that is available to the any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Group Company. Any person

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest

payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in
respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful,
the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan
but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be
cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of
other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate
therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the
Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received
by such Lender.

                           SECTION 11.14. LENDER ADDENDUM. Each Lender to become
