SECTION 2. CREDIT EXTENSIONS

         2.1      TRANCHE B TERM LOANS. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each Lender severally agrees to lend to Company, on or before December
19, 2003, a Tranche B Term Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Tranche B
Term Loan Amount to be used for the purposes identified in Section 2.5. Any
amount borrowed under this Section 2.1, and subsequently repaid or prepaid, may
not be reborrowed.

         2.2      REVOLVING LOANS AND SWING LINE LOANS. (a) During the Revolving
Loan Commitment Period, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, (i) each
Lender severally agrees to make Revolving Loans to Company in the aggregate
amount up to but not exceeding such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, and (ii)
Swing Line Lender hereby agrees to make Swing Line Loans to Company in an
aggregate amount up to but not exceeding the Swing Line Sublimit, in each case
to be used for the purposes identified in Section 2.5. Amounts borrowed pursuant
to this Section 2.2 may be repaid and reborrowed during the Revolving Loan
Commitment Period. Each Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, and Swing Line
Lender's Swing Line Loan Commitment, shall expire on the Revolving Loan
Commitment Termination Date and all Revolving Loans and all Swing Line Loans and
all other amounts owed hereunder with respect to the Revolving Loans, the Swing
Line Loans, the Revolving Loan Commitments and the Swing Line Loan Commitment
shall be paid in full no later than such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Revolving Loan Commitments and the Swing Line Loan Commitment shall expire
immediately and without further action on December 19, 2003 if the Tranche B
Term Loans are not made on or before that date.

         (b)      Except pursuant to Section 2.2(e) or Section 2.3(d), (i)
Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans shall be made in an aggregate minimum
amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount,

Loan Commitments then in effect.

         (c)      Whenever Company desires that Lenders make Loans, Company
shall deliver to Administrative Agent a fully executed and delivered Funding
Notice no later

than 12:00 noon (New York City time) (i) at least three (3) Business Days in
advance of the proposed Credit Extension Date in the case of a Eurodollar Rate
Loan; and (ii) at least one (1) Business Day in advance of the proposed Credit
Extension Date in the case of a Base Rate Loan; provided, whenever Company
desires that Swing Line Lender make a Swing Line Loan, it shall deliver to
Administrative Agent a Funding Notice no later than 12:00 noon (New York City
time) on the proposed Credit Extension Date. Except as otherwise provided
herein, a Funding Notice for a Eurodollar Rate Loan (or telephonic notice in
lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate
Determination Date, and Company shall be bound to make a borrowing in accordance
therewith. Promptly after receipt by Administrative Agent of a Funding Notice
(or telephonic notice in lieu thereof), Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, of the proposed borrowing.

         (d)      Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to
Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the
applicable Credit Extension Date, and Swing Line Lender shall make the amount of
its Swing Line Loan available to Administrative Agent not later than 2:30 p.m.
(New York City time) on the applicable Credit Extension Date, in each case by
wire transfer of same day funds in Dollars, at the Funding and Payment Office
(or, in the case of Swing Line Loans, at such other place as Administrative
Agent, Company and Swing Line Lender may approve). Except as provided herein,
upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent specified herein,
Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of such Loans available to Company
on the applicable Credit Extension Date by causing an amount of same day funds
in Dollars equal to the proceeds of all such Loans received by Administrative
Agent from Lenders or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, to be credited to
the account of Company at the Funding and Payment Office (or, in the case of
Swing Line Loans, at such other place as Administrative Agent, Company and Swing
Line Lender may approve).

         (e)      With respect to any Swing Line Loan that has not been
voluntarily prepaid by Company, Swing Line Lender may, at any time in its sole
and absolute discretion, deliver to Administrative Agent (with a copy to
Company), no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the first Business
Day in advance of the proposed Credit Extension Date, a notice (the "REFUNDING
NOTICE") (which shall be deemed to be a Funding Notice given by Company)
requesting Lenders having Revolving Credit Exposure to make Revolving Loans that
are Base Rate Loans on such Credit Extension Date in an amount equal to the
amount of such Swing Line Loans (each, a "REFUNDED SWING LINE LOAN") outstanding
on the date of such Refunding Notice. Promptly after receipt by Administrative
Agent of a Refunding Notice, Administrative Agent shall notify each such Lender
thereof. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the proceeds
of such Revolving Loans made by Lenders shall be immediately delivered by
Administrative Agent solely to Swing Line Lender and applied to repay a
corresponding amount of the applicable Refunded Swing Line Loans. Company hereby
authorizes Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender to charge Company's
accounts, if any (up to the amount available in each such account) in order to
immediately pay Swing Line Lender the amount of the Refunded Swing Line Loans to
the extent the proceeds of such

Revolving Loans made by Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full the Refunded
Swing Line Loans. If any portion of any such amount paid to Swing Line Lender
should be recovered by or on behalf of Company from Swing Line Lender in
bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of
the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all Lenders having
Revolving Credit Exposure in the manner contemplated by Section 10.4.

         (f)      If for any reason (i) Revolving Loans are not made upon the
request of Swing Line Lender as provided in Section 2.2(e) in an amount
sufficient to repay any amounts owed to Swing Line Lender in respect of any
outstanding Swing Line Loans; or (ii) the Revolving Loan Commitments are
terminated at a time when any Swing Line Loans are outstanding, then, in either
case, each Lender having Revolving Credit Exposure shall be deemed to, and
hereby agrees to, have purchased a participation in such outstanding Swing Line
Loans in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share (calculated, in the case of this
clause (ii), immediately prior to such termination of the Revolving Loan
Commitments) of the unpaid amount of such Swing Line Loans together with accrued
interest thereon. Upon one Business Day's notice from Swing Line Lender, each
such Lender shall deliver to Swing Line Lender an amount equal to its respective
participation in same day funds at the Funding and Payment Office. In order to
further evidence such participation (and without prejudice to the effectiveness
of the participation provisions set forth above), each such Lender agrees to
enter into a separate participation agreement at the request of Swing Line
Lender in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Swing Line Lender. In
the event any such Lender fails to make available to Swing Line Lender the
amount of such Lender's participation as provided herein, Swing Line Lender
shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together
with interest thereon at the rate customarily used by Swing Line Lender for the
correction of errors among banks for three (3) Business Days and thereafter at
the Base Rate. In the event Swing Line Lender receives a payment of any amount
in which other Lenders have purchased participations as provided herein, Swing
Line Lender shall promptly distribute to each such other Lender its Pro Rata
Share of such payment. In addition, in the case of each Lender that is deemed to
have purchased a participation in such outstanding Swing Line Loan as specified
in this Section 2.2(f), the Swing Line Lender (i) shall keep a register, meeting
the requirements of Temporary Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), of each
such Lender, specifying such Lender's entitlement to payments of principal and
interest with respect to such participation, and (ii) shall collect, prior to
the time such Lender receives payments, from each such Lender the appropriate
forms, certificates and statements described in Section 2.20 (and updated as
required by Section 2.20) as if such Lender were a Lender under Section 2.20.

         (g)      Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
each such Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans for the purpose of
repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans, and each such Lender's obligation to
purchase a participation in any unpaid Swing Line Loans, shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may
have against Swing Line Lender, any Credit Party or any other Person for any
reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuation of an

of Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) any breach hereof or any other
Credit Document by any party thereto; or (v) any other circumstance, happening
or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided,
such obligations of each such Lender are subject to the condition that (1) Swing
Line Lender believed in good faith that all conditions under Section 3 to the
making of the applicable Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing Line
Loans, as the case may be, were satisfied at the time such Refunded Swing Line
Loans or unpaid Swing Line Loans were made, or (2) the satisfaction of any such
condition not satisfied had been waived in accordance with Section 10.5 prior to
or at the time such Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing Line Loans
were made.

         2.3      LETTERS OF CREDIT. (a) During the Revolving Loan Commitment
Period, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Company may request from
time to time (but in no event later than the date that is thirty (30) days prior
to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date) that one or more Lenders
issue Letters of Credit for the account of Company for the purposes specified in
the definitions of Commercial Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit;
provided that all such Letters of Credit shall provide for sight drawings.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the
representations and warranties of Company herein set forth, any one or more
Lenders may, but (except as provided herein) shall not be obligated to, issue
such Letters of Credit in accordance with the provisions hereof; provided,
Company shall not request that any Lender issue, and no Lender shall issue: (i)
any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, the Total
Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments would exceed the Revolving Loan
Commitments then in effect; (ii) any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to
such issuance, the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Letter of Credit
Sublimit then in effect; (iii) any Standby Letter of Credit having an expiration
date later than the earlier of (1) the 10th Business Day prior to the Revolving
Loan Commitment Termination Date and (2) the date which is one year after the
date of issuance of such Standby Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Issuing Bank may agree that the expiration date of a Standby Letter
of Credit will be automatically extended for one or more successive periods not
to exceed one year each unless the Issuing Bank elects not to extend the
expiration date for any such additional period and further provided that no
expiration date for a Standby Letter of Credit will be extended beyond the 10th
Business Day prior t o the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date; (iv) any
Commercial Letter of Credit having an expiration date (a) later than the earlier
of (1) the 30th day prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date and
(2) the date which is 180 days after the date of issuance of such Commercial
Letter of Credit (or such other date as shall be agreed to by the Issuing Bank)
or (b) that is otherwise unacceptable to the Issuing Bank in its reasonable
discretion; or (v) any Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than
Dollars.

         (b)      Whenever Company desires the issuance of a Letter of Credit,
it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Request for Issuance no later than
12:00 noon (New York City time) at least three (3) Business Days (in the case of
Standby Letters of Credit) or five (5) Business Days (in the case of Commercial
Letters of Credit), or in each case

such shorter period as may be agreed to by Issuing Bank in any particular
instance, in advance of the proposed date of issuance. Issuing Bank, in its
reasonable discretion, may require changes in the text of the proposed Letter of
Credit or any such documents. Upon receipt by Administrative Agent of a Request
for Issuance pursuant to this Section, in the event Administrative Agent elects
to issue such Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify
Company, and Administrative Agent shall be Issuing Bank with respect thereto. In
the event that Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, elects not to issue
such Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify Company,
whereupon Company may request any other Lender to issue such Letter of Credit by
delivering to such Lender a copy of the applicable Request for Issuance. Any
Lender so requested to issue such Letter of Credit shall promptly notify Company
and Administrative Agent whether or not, in its sole discretion, it has elected
to issue such Letter of Credit, and any such Lender which so elects to issue
such Letter of Credit shall be the Issuing Bank with respect thereto. In the
event that all other Lenders shall have declined to issue such Letter of Credit,
notwithstanding the prior election of Administrative Agent not to issue such
Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent shall be obligated to issue such Letter
of Credit and shall be Issuing Bank with respect thereto, notwithstanding the
fact that the Letter of Credit Usage with respect to such Letter of Credit and
with respect to all other Letters of Credit issued by Administrative Agent, when
aggregated with Administrative Agent's outstanding Revolving Loans and Swing
Line Loans, may exceed Administrative Agent's Revolving Loan Commitment then in
effect. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 3.2,
Issuing Bank shall issue the requested Letter of Credit. Upon the issuance or
amendment of any Standby Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank shall notify the
Administrative Agent and the Company, in writing of such issuance or amendment
and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such issuance or amendment.
Promptly after the receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each Lender, in writing, of such issuance or amendment and in the event any
Lender shall so request, the Administrative Agent shall provide such Lender with
copies of such issuance or amendment. With regard to Commercial Letters of
Credit, each Issuing Bank shall on the first Business Day of each week furnish
the Administrative Agent, by facsimile, with a report detailing the daily
aggregate outstanding Commercial Letters of Credit for such Issuing Bank during
the previous week.

         (c)      In determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter
of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, Issuing Bank shall be responsible only to
examine the documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care
so as to ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. As between Company and
Issuing Bank, Company assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse
of the Letters of Credit issued by Issuing Bank by, the respective beneficiaries
of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity,
sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by
any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any such Letter
of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency
of any instrument transferring or

assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the
rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which
may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the
beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions
required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit, except to the extent that
such failure is the result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Issuing Bank, as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or
otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of
technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or
of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such
Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or
(viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of Issuing Bank,
including any Governmental Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair,
or prevent the vesting of, any of Issuing Bank's rights or powers hereunder.
Without limiting the foregoing and in furtherance thereof, any action taken or
omitted by Issuing Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit or any
documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good
faith (and without gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a
final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and in
accordance with the standard of care specified in the UCC with respect to
Letters of Credit), shall not put Issuing Bank under any resulting liability to
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
2.3(c), Company shall retain any and all rights it may have against Issuing Bank
for any liability arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Issuing Bank, as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction or failure of such Issuing Bank to use the
standard of care specified in the UCC with respect to Letters of Credit.

         (d)      In the event Issuing Bank has determined to honor a drawing
under a Letter of Credit, it shall immediately notify Company and Administrative
Agent, and Company shall reimburse Issuing Bank on or before the Business Day
immediately following the date on which such drawing is honored (the
"REIMBURSEMENT DATE") in an amount in Dollars and in same day funds equal to the
amount of such honored drawing; provided, anything contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless Company shall have notified Administrative
Agent and Issuing Bank prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date such
drawing is honored (or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the
immediately following Business Day if such drawing is made after 11:00 a.m. on
the previous Business Day) that Company intends to reimburse Issuing Bank for
the amount of such honored drawing with funds other than the proceeds of
Revolving Loans, Company shall be deemed to have given a timely Funding Notice
to Administrative Agent requesting Lenders having a Revolving Loan Commitment to
make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an
amount in Dollars equal to the amount of such honored drawing, and (ii) subject
to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in Section 3.2 (and
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each such Lender of such deemed
request), Lenders having a Revolving Loan Commitment shall, on the Reimbursement
Date, make Revolving Loans that are

Base Rate Loans in the amount of such honored drawing, the proceeds of which
shall be applied directly by Administrative Agent to reimburse Issuing Bank for
the amount of such honored drawing; and provided further, if for any reason
proceeds of Revolving Loans are not received by Issuing Bank on the
Reimbursement Date in an amount equal to the amount of such honored drawing,
Company shall reimburse Issuing Bank, on demand, in an amount in same day funds
equal to the excess of the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate
amount of such Revolving Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this
Section 2.3(d) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender having a Revolving Loan
Commitment from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on the terms and
conditions set forth herein, and Company shall retain any and all rights it may
have against any such Lender resulting from the failure of such Lender to make
such Revolving Loans under this Section 2.3(d).

         (e)      Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment shall be deemed to have irrevocably
purchased, and hereby agrees to irrevocably purchase, from Issuing Bank a
participation in such Letter of Credit and any drawings honored thereunder in an
amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share (with respect to the Revolving Loan
Commitments) of the maximum amount which is or at any time may become available
to be drawn thereunder. In the event that Company shall fail for any reason to
reimburse Issuing Bank as provided in Section 2.3(d), Issuing Bank shall
promptly notify each such Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such honored
drawing and of such Lender's respective participation therein based on such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan Commitments. Each such Lender
shall make available to Issuing Bank an amount equal to its respective
participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of Issuing Bank
specified in such notice, not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the
first Business Day (under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such office of
Issuing Bank is located) after the date notified by Issuing Bank. In the event
that any Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment fails to make available to
Issuing Bank on such business day the amount of such Lender's participation in
such Letter of Credit as provided in this Section 2.3(e), Issuing Bank shall be
entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with
interest thereon at the rate customarily used by Issuing Bank for the correction
of errors among banks for three (3) Business Days and thereafter at the Base
Rate. Nothing in this Section 2.3(e) shall be deemed to prejudice the right of
any Lender to recover from Issuing Bank any amounts made available by such
Lender to Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section in the event that it is
determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the
payment with respect to a Letter of Credit in respect of which payment was made
by such Lender constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
Issuing Bank or resulted from Issuing Bank's failure to use the standard of care
specified in the UCC with respect to Letters of Credit. In the event Issuing
Bank shall have been reimbursed by other Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.3(e)
for all or any portion of any drawing honored by Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit, such Issuing Bank shall distribute to each Lender which has paid all
amounts payable by it under this Section 2.3(e) with respect to such honored
drawing such Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments subsequently received by
Issuing Bank from Company in reimbursement of such honored drawing promptly when

payments are received. Any such distribution shall be made to a Lender at its
primary address set forth below its name on the appropriate signature page
hereof or at such other address as such Lender may request. In addition, in the
case of each Lender that is deemed to have irrevocably purchased from Issuing
Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit as specified in this Section
2.3(e), the Issuing Bank shall keep a register specifying such Lender's
entitlement to payments with respect to such participation in accordance with
its normal business practice which is intended to meet the requirements of
Temporary Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c).

         (f)      The obligation of Company to reimburse Issuing Bank for
drawings honored under the Letters of Credit issued by it and to repay any
Revolving Loans made by Lenders pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and the obligations
of Lenders having Revolving Credit Exposure under Section 2.3(e) shall be
unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms hereof under all circumstances including any of the following
circumstances: (i) any lack o f validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit; (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which
Company or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary or any
transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such transferee
may be acting), Issuing Bank, Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a
Lender, against Company, whether in connection herewith, the transactions
contemplated herein o r any unrelated transaction (including any underlying
transaction between Company or one of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for
which any Letter of Credit was procured); (iii) any draft or other document
presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid
or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect; (iv) payment by Issuing Bank under any Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document which does not
substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, except where such
payment constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank, as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction or results from Issuing Bank's failure to use the
standard of care specified in the UCC with respect to Letters of Credit; (v) any
adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects of Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(vi) any breach of this Agreement or any other Credit Document by any party
thereto; (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing; or (viii) the fact that an Event of Default or
a Default shall have occurred and be continuing; provided, in each case, that
payment by Issuing Bank under the applicable Letter of Credit shall not have
constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Bank, as
determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction or failure of such Issuing Bank to use the standard of care
specified in the UCC with respect to Letters of Credit under the circumstances
in question.

         (g)      In addition to amounts payable as provided herein, Company
hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless Issuing Bank from and
against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs,

relating to Taxes (and any liabilities relating thereto), the indemnity for
which shall be governed solely and exclusively by Section 2.20) which Issuing
Bank may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the
issuance of any Letter of Credit by Issuing Bank, other than as a result of (1)
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Bank, as determined by a
final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or
failure of such Issuing Bank to use the standard of care specified in the UCC
with respect to Letters of Credit, or (2) subject to the following clause (ii),
the wrongful dishonor by Issuing Bank of a proper demand for payment made under
any Letter of Credit issued by it, or (ii) the failure of Issuing Bank to honor
a drawing under any such Letter of Credit as a result of any Governmental Act.

         2.4      PRO RATA SHARES. All Loans made and all participations
purchased pursuant to Section 2.1, 2.2 and Section 2.3 shall be made or
purchased, as the case may be, by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to
their respective applicable Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that no Lender
shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in such other Lender's
obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder or purchase a participation
required hereby nor shall the Revolving Loan Commitment or Term Loan amount of
any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of a default by any other
Lender in such other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder or
purchase a participation required hereby. Unless Administrative Agent shall have
been notified by any Lender prior to the applicable Credit Extension Date that
such Lender does not intend to make available to Administrative Agent the amount
of such Lender's Loan requested on such Credit Extension Date, Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to
Administrative Agent on such Credit Extension Date and Administrative Agent may,
in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to, make available to Company
a corresponding amount on such Credit Extension Date. If such corresponding
amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by such Lender,
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on
demand from such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from such
Credit Extension Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative
Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the correction of
errors among banks for three (3) Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate.
If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon
Administrative Agent's demand therefor, Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify Company and Company shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to
Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from such
Credit Extension Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative
Agent, at the rate payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans. Nothing in this
Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill
its Revolving Loan Commitments or its commitments to make Term Loans hereunder
or to prejudice any rights that Company may have against any Lender as a result
of any default by such Lender hereunder.

         2.5      USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of (a) the Tranche B Term Loans
and up to $8,200,000 of Revolving Loans made on the Closing Date shall be
applied by Company to fund a portion of the Acquisition Financing Requirements
and (b) the Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit made after
the Closing Date

shall be applied by Company for working capital and general corporate purposes
of Parent and its Subsidiaries and other purposes permitted hereunder. The
proceeds from any New Term Loans shall be applied by Company for working
capital, general corporate purposes and other purposes permitted hereunder. No
portion of the proceeds of any Credit Extension shall be used in any manner that
causes or might cause such Credit Extension or the application of such proceeds
to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation thereof or to violate the
Exchange Act.

         2.6      NOTES; REGISTER; LENDERS' BOOKS AND RECORDS. If so requested
by any Lender by written notice to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent)
at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, or at any time thereafter,
Company shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and or, if applicable and if
so specified in such notice, to any Person who is a permitted assignee of such
Lender pursuant to Section 10.6) on the Closing Date (or, if such notice is
delivered after the Closing Date, promptly after Company's receipt of such
notice) a Note or Notes to evidence such Lender's Tranche B Term Loan, New Term
Loan, Revolving Loan or Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. Administrative
Agent shall maintain, at its address referred to in Section 10.1,a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of Lenders and Issuing Banks and the
Revolving Loan Commitments and Loans of each Lender and Letters of Credit, and
drawings honored under the Letters of Credit, issued by each Issuing Bank from
time to time (the "REGISTER"). The Register shall be available for inspection by
Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the
Revolving Loan Commitments and the Loans of each Lender and Letters of Credit,
and drawings honored under the Letters of Credit, issued by each Issuing Bank,
and each repayment or prepayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans
(and related interest payments with respect to the Loans) and any reimbursement
amounts paid to each Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.3 (and related
interest payments), and any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on
Company and each Lender, absent demonstrable error; provided, failure to make
any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any
Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment or Company's Obligations in respect of any
Loan. Company hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as Company's
agent solely for purposes of maintaining the Register as provided in this
Section 2.6, and Company hereby agrees that, to the extent the Administrative
Agent serves in such capacity, the Administrative Agent and its officers,
directors, employees, agents and affiliates shall constitute Indemnitees for all
purposes. Each Lender shall record on its internal records, including its Notes,
the amount of the Loans and Letters of Credit made or issued, as the case may
be, by it and each repayment and prepayment and interest payment in respect
thereof. Any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on Company, absent
demonstrable error; provided, failure to make any such recordation, or any error
in such recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or Company's
Obligations in respect of any applicable Loans and Letters of Credit; and
provided, further, in the event of any inconsistency between the Register and
any Lender's records, the recordations in the Register shall govern. Company,
Administrative Agent and Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed as
Lenders in the Register as the holders and owners of the

corresponding Revolving Loan Commitments and Loans listed therein for all
purposes hereof.

         2.7      INTEREST PAYMENTS. (a) Except as otherwise set forth herein,
each Class of Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof
from the date made through maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at
the sum of (x) the applicable interest rate for the Type of Loan of such Class
plus (y) the Applicable Margin for such Type of Loan of such Class. The Type of
any Loan (except a Swing Line Loan), and the Interest Period with respect to any
Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be selected by Company and notified to
Administrative Agent and Lenders pursuant to the applicable Funding Notice or
Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be. If on any day a Loan is
outstanding with respect to which notice has not been delivered to
Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof specifying the
applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day such
Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, in connection with Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) there shall be no more
than 16 Interest Periods outstanding at any time; and (ii) in the event Company
fails to specify an Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan in the
applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, Company shall be
deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month. As soon as practicable
after 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date,
Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent
demonstrable error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the
interest rate that shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an
interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and
shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in
writing) to Company and each Lender.

         (b)      Company agrees to pay to Issuing Bank, with respect to
drawings honored under any Letter of Credit honored by it, interest on the
amount paid by Issuing Bank in respect of each such honored drawing from the
date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed
by or on behalf of Company at a rate equal to (i) for the period from the date
such drawing is honored to but excluding one day after the applicable
Reimbursement Date, (1) the Base Rate, plus (2) the Applicable Margin for
Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans, and (ii) thereafter, a rate which is
2% per annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable hereunder with
respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans.

         (c)      Interest payable hereunder shall be computed (i) in the case
of Base Rate Loans, on the basis of a 365/6-day year, as the case may be, and
(ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the basis of a 360-day year, in
each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it
accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of such Loan
or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect
to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of
conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may
be, shall be included, and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration
date of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base
Rate Loan being converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of
such

Base Rate Loan to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be
excluded; provided, if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one
day's interest shall be paid on that Loan.

         (d)      Except as otherwise set forth herein, interest on each Loan
shall be payable in arrears on and to (i) each Interest Payment Date applicable
to that Loan; (ii) any prepayment of that Loan, to the extent accrued on the
amount being prepaid; and (iii) at maturity, including final maturity; provided,
in the event any Swing Line Loan or any Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan
is prepaid pursuant to Section 2.12(a), interest accrued on such Swing Line Loan
or Revolving Loan through the date of such prepayment shall be payable on the
next succeeding Interest Payment Date applicable to Base Rate Loan, or, if
earlier, at final maturity.

         (e)      Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.7(b) shall be payable
on demand or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related drawing
honored under a Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full. Promptly upon receipt by
Issuing Bank of any payment of interest pursuant to Section 2.7(b), (i) Issuing
Bank shall distribute to each Lender having Revolving Credit Exposure, out of
the interest received by Issuing Bank in respect of the period from the date
such drawing is honored to but excluding the date on which Issuing Bank is
reimbursed for the amount of such drawing (including any such reimbursement out
of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans), the amount that such Lender would have
been entitled to receive in respect of the letter of credit fee that would have
been payable in respect of such Letter of Credit for such period if no drawing
had been honored under such Letter of Credit, and (ii) in the event Issuing Bank
shall have been reimbursed by Lenders for all or any portion of such honored
drawing, Issuing Bank shall distribute to each Lender having Revolving Credit
Exposure which has paid all amounts payable by it under Section 2.3(e) with
respect to such honored drawing such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of any
interest received by Issuing Bank in respect of that portion of such honored
drawing so reimbursed by Lenders for the period from the date on which Issuing
Bank was so reimbursed by Lenders to but excluding the date on which such
portion of such honored drawing is reimbursed by Company. Any such distribution
shall be made to a Lender at its primary address set forth below its name on the
appropriate signature page hereof or at such other address as such Lender may
request.

         2.8      CONVERSION; CONTINUATION. Company shall have the option (a) to
convert at any time all or any part of any Class of Loans from one Type of Loan
to another Type of Loan, provided, that partial conversions of Base Rate Loans
shall be in the aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples
of $100,000 in excess of that amount and the aggregate principal amount of the
resulting Eurodollar Rate Loans outstanding in respect of any one (1) Interest
Period shall be at least $2,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in
excess of that amount; or (B) upon the expiration of any Interest Period
applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or any portion of such
Loan as a Eurodollar Rate Loan; provided, (1) a Eurodollar Rate Loan may only be
converted into a Base Rate Loan on the expiration date of an Interest Period
applicable thereto and (2) the aggregate principal amount of the resulting
Eurodollar Rate Loans outstanding in respect of any one Interest Period shall be
at least $2,000,000 and integral

multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount. Company shall deliver a
Conversion/Continuation Notice to Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) at least one (1) Business Day in advance of the proposed
conversion date (in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least
three (3) Business Days in advance of the proposed conversion/continuation date
(in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan).
Except as otherwise provided herein, a Conversion/Continuation Notice for
conversion to, or continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan (or telephonic notice
in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate
Determination Date, and Company shall be bound to effect a conversion or
continuation in accordance therewith. After the occurrence of and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, unless the Requisite Lenders otherwise
consent, (i) Company may not elect to have a Loan be made or maintained as, or
converted to, a Eurodollar Rate Loan after the expiration of any Interest Period
then in effect for that Loan; and (ii) any Funding Notice or
Conversion/Continuation Notice given by Company with respect to a requested
borrowing or conversion/continuation that has not yet occurred shall be deemed
to be rescinded by Company.

         2.9      POST-MATURITY INTEREST. Any principal payments on the Loans
not paid when due and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest
payments on the Loans or any fees or other amounts owed hereunder not paid when
due, in each case whether at stated maturity, by notice of prepayment, by
acceleration or otherwise, shall thereafter bear interest (including
post-petition interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other
applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand at a rate which is 2% per annum in
excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder with respect to the
applicable Loans (or, in the case of any such fees and other amounts, at a rate
which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder
for Base Rate Loans that are Revolving Loans); provided, in the case of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, upon the expiration of the Interest Period in effect at
the time any such increase in interest rate is effective such Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall thereupon become Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear interest
payable upon demand at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest
rate otherwise payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans of the Class in question.
Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in this
Section 2.9 is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not
constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any
rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender.

         2.10     FEES. (a) Company agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, for
distribution to each Lender having Revolving Credit Exposure in proportion to
that Lender's Pro Rata Share (determined with respect to the Revolving Loan
Commitments), commitment fees for the Revolving Loan Commitment Period equal to
the product of (i) the average of the daily difference between (1) the Revolving
Loan Commitments, minus (2) the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Revolving Loans (but not any outstanding Swing Line Loans) plus (b)
the Letter of Credit Usage, multiplied by the (ii) Applicable Commitment Fee
Percentage. All such commitment fees shall be calculated on the basis of a
360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and shall be payable
quarterly in arrears on March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 30 of

each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Closing Date,
and on the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date.

         (b)      Company agrees to pay (i) a fronting fee, payable directly to
Issuing Bank for its own account, equal to 0.25% per annum of the aggregate
daily amount available to be drawn under all Letters of Credit issued by it, and
(ii) a letter of credit fee, payable to Administrative Agent for the account of
Lenders having Revolving Credit Exposure, equal to the product of (1) the
Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans, multiplied
by (2) the daily amount available to be drawn under all such Letters of Credit,
each such fee to be payable in arrears on and to (but not including) the last
Business Day of each of January, April, July and October of each year and
computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.
Without duplication of the foregoing fees, Company agrees to pay documentary and
processing charges payable directly to Issuing Bank for its own account in
accordance with Issuing Bank's standard schedule for such charges in effect at
the time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may be.
For purposes of calculating any fees payable under this Section, the daily
amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit shall be determined as
of the close of business on any date of determination. Promptly upon receipt by
Administrative Agent of any amount described in clause (ii) above,
Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Lender having Revolving Credit
Exposure its Pro Rata Share (determined with respect to the Revolving Loan
Commitments) of such amount.

         (c)      Company agrees to pay to the Agents such other fees in the
amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between Company and the Agents.

         2.11     SCHEDULED PAYMENTS. Company shall make principal payments on
the Tranche B Term Loans in installments (each an "INSTALLMENT") on the dates

Loan Commitments if such termination would have resulted from a refinancing of
all of the Loans and such refinancing shall not be consummated or otherwise
shall be delayed.

         made to Lenders holding the Offer Loans on a pro rata basis in
         accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided, further that, if any
         Lender elects not to participate in the Offer, either in whole or in
         part, the amount of such Lender's Offer Loans not being tendered shall
         be excluded in calculating the pro rata amount applicable to the
         balance of such Offer Loans;

                  (iii)    With respect to all repurchases made by Company
         pursuant to this Section 2.12(c), (A) company shall pay all accrued and

         securities registered under the Securities Act (whether or not such
         securities are outstanding) as if such offer was being made as of the
         date of such repurchase of Term Loans from a Lender and (C) such
         repurchases shall not be deemed to be voluntary prepayments pursuant to
         this Section 2.12, Section 2.13 or 2.16 hereunder except that the
         amount of the Loans so repurchased shall be applied on a pro rata basis
         to reduce the scheduled remaining Installments of principal on such
         Term Loan;

                  (iv)     Following repurchase by Company pursuant to this
         Section 2.12(c), the Term Loans so repurchased shall be deemed

         not be subject to the provisions of either Section 2.16 or Section
         2.17. Failure by Company to make any payment to a Lender required by an
         agreement permitted by this Section 2.12(c) shall not constitute an
         Event of Default under Section 8.1 (a); and

                  (v)      Notwithstanding any of the provisions set forth in
         this Agreement to the contrary, Company, the Lenders and Agents hereby
         agree that nothing in this Agreement shall be understood to mean or

Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, Company shall prepay the Loans and/or the
Revolving Loan Commitments shall be permanently reduced in an aggregate amount
equal to such Net Asset Sale Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, as
the case may be; provided, so long as Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, Company may deliver to Administrative Agent a certificate of an
Authorized Officer of Company setting forth (1) that portion of such Net Asset
Sale Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds (such portion being the
"PROPOSED REINVESTMENT PROCEEDS") that Company or such Subsidiary intends to
reinvest within 365 days of the date of receipt, in non-current assets useful in
the business of Company and its Subsidiaries, which may include, in the case of
any Proposed Reinvestment Proceeds which related to Net Insurance/Condemnation
Proceeds, the repair, restoration or replacement of the applicable assets of
Company or its Subsidiaries (such assets being "ELIGIBLE ASSETS") and (2) the
proposed use of such Proposed Reinvestment Proceeds and such other information
with respect to such reinvestment as Administrative Agent may reasonably
request. In the event Collateral Agent shall receive any Net
Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds in its capacity as loss payee pursuant to
Section 5.5, Company hereby authorizes Collateral Agent to apply an amount equal
to all such amounts in accordance with this Section 2.13(a); provided, if
Company shall elect to exercise its option to reinvest any such proceeds
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.13(a), Company shall give
notice to Administrative Agent of such election and Administrative Agent shall
pay over to Company such proceeds and Company shall reinvest such proceeds in
accordance with the terms of such sentence.

deemed to have been paid by Company on the next succeeding Business Day. All
payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan (other than voluntary
prepayments of Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans) shall include payment of
accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such

applicable Pro Rata Share of all payments and prepayments of principal and
interest due hereunder, together with all other amounts due thereto, including,
without limitation, all fees payable thereto, received by Administrative Agent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, if any Conversion/Continuation
Notice is withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or if any Affected Lender makes
Base Rate Loans in lieu of its applicable Pro Rata Share of any Eurodollar Rate
Loans, Administrative Agent shall give effect thereto in apportioning payments
received thereafter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, payments
of amounts deposited in the collateral account pursuant to Section 2.14(c) shall
be deemed to have been paid by Company on the later of (a) the date such amounts
are so deposited, and (b) if Company elects to apply such amounts in accordance
with Section 2.14(c), the applicable date or dates such amounts are applied to
prepay Eurodollar Rate Loans.

any of them shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary
prepayment of Loans made and applied in accordance with the terms hereof), by
realization upon security, through the exercise of any right of set-off or

right under the Credit Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a
deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or
reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest,
amounts payable in respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due
and owing to such Lender hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
(collectively, the "AGGREGATE AMOUNTS DUE" to such Lender) which is greater than
the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts
Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater
payment shall (i) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the
receipt of such payment and (ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase
participations (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a
participation simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of
such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such
recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion
to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them; provided, if all or part of such
proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Company or
otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for
such participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest. Company expressly consents to the
foregoing

arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased may
exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with
respect to any and all monies owing by Company to that holder with respect
thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation
held by that holder directly by Company.

         2.18     MAKING OR MAINTAINING EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS. (a) In the event
that Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which determination
shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), on any
Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans, that
by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market adequate and
fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such
Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate,
Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by
telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and each Lender of such
determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted to,
Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as Administrative Agent notifies Company
and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist,
which notice shall be given as soon as reasonably practicable and (ii) any
Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by Company with respect
to the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to
be rescinded by Company without the necessity of paying any amount under Section
2.18(c), and any Funding Notice previously delivered by Company which requested
Eurodollar Rate Loans may be revoked by Company or, failing that, shall be
deemed to be converted into a request(s) for borrowing of Base Rate Loans.

         (b)      In the event that on any date any Lender shall have reasonably
determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon
all parties hereto but shall be made only after consultation with Company and
Administrative Agent) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its
Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such
Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation,
guideline or order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule,
regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the
failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or (ii) has become
impracticable, or would cause such Lender material hardship, as a result of
contingencies occurring after the date hereof which materially and adversely
affect the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in that
market, then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an "AFFECTED LENDER"
and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed
in writing) to Company and Administrative Agent of such determination (which
notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender).
Thereafter (1) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to
convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such notice
shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (2) to the extent such determination
by the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by
Company pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the
Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or convert such Loan to, as the case
may be) a Base Rate Loan, (3) the Affected Lender's obligation to maintain its
outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans (the "AFFECTED LOANS") shall be terminated at
the earlier to occur of the expiration of the

Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when
required by law, and (4) the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into
Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates
to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a Funding
Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, Company shall have the option,
subject to the provisions of Section 2.18(c), to rescind such Funding Notice or
Conversion/Continuation Notice as to all Lenders by giving notice (by
telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Administrative Agent of
such rescission on the date on which the Affected Lender gives notice of its
determination as described above (which notice of rescission Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Section 2.18(b) shall affect the
obligation of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans
as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans in accordance with the terms
hereof.

         (c)      Company shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by
such Lender (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such
amounts), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any
interest paid by such Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry
its Eurodollar Rate Loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by such
Lender in connection with the liquidation or reemployment of such funds but
excluding (a) any loss solely attributable to the failure to receive the
Applicable Margin on a Eurodollar Rate Loan for any period after (y) the date
specified for such Eurodollar Rate Loan in the case of clause (i) below and (z)
the date such Eurodollar Rate Loans are prepaid or converted in the case of
clause (ii) below) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other
than a default by such Lender) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not
occur on a date specified therefor in a Funding Notice or a telephonic request
for borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan
does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Conversion/Continuation Notice
or a telephonic request for conversion or continuation; (ii) if any prepayment
or other principal payment or any conversion of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans
occurs on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable to that
Loan; or (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made
on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by Company and (b) any
loss, expense or liability with respect to Taxes (and any liabilities relating
thereto), the indemnity for which shall be governed solely and exclusively by
Section 2.20.

         (d)      Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans
at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an
Affiliate of such Lender. In addition, in the case of each Lender that makes,
carries or transfers any Eurodollar Rate Loan at, to, or for the account of an
office of an Affiliate of such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18(d), such
Lender: (i) shall keep a register, meeting the requirements of Temporary
Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), relating to each such Affiliate of such
Lender, specifying such Affiliate's entitlement to payments of principal and
interest with respect to such Loan, and (ii) shall collect, prior to the time
such Affiliate receives payments, from each such Lender the appropriate forms,
certificates and statements

described in Section 2.20 (and updated as required by Section 2.20) as if such
Affiliate were a Lender under Section 2.20.

         (e)      Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this
Section 2.18 and under Section 2.19 shall be made as though such Lender had
actually funded each of its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase
of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to clause
(i) of the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the
amount of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to the
relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit
from an offshore office of such Lender to a domestic office of such Lender in
the United States of America; provided, each Lender may fund each of its
Eurodollar Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions
shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating amounts payable under
this Section 2.18 and under Section 2.19.

         2.19     INCREASED COSTS; CAPITAL ADEQUACY. Subject to the provisions
of Section 2.20 (which shall be controlling with respect to the Tax matters), in
the event that any Lender (which term shall include Issuing Bank for purposes of
this Section 2.19) shall reasonably determine (which determination shall, absent
demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto)
that any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change
therein or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof
(including the introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation or order), or any determination of a court or governmental authority,
in each case that becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such
Lender with any guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date
hereof by any central bank or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law): (a) imposes, modifies or holds
applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special
or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for
the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit (including letters of
credit) extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such
Lender (other than any such reserve or other requirements with respect to
Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate); or (b) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to
a Tax matter) on or affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or
its obligations hereunder or the London interbank market; and the result of any
of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make,
making or maintaining Loans hereunder or to reduce any amount received or
receivable by such Lender (or its applicable lending office) with respect
thereto; then, in any such case, Company shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon
receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional
amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of
calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its reasonable discretion
shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such
increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such
Lender shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written
statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the
additional amounts owed to such Lender under this Section 2.19,

which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent
demonstrable error.

         2.20     TAXES; WITHHOLDING, ETC. (a) All sums payable by any Credit
Party hereunder and the other Credit Documents shall (except to the extent
required by law) be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or
withholding on account of, any Tax (other than a Tax on the overall net income
of any Lender or any Agent), imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by
or within the United States of America or any political subdivision in or of the
United States of America or any other jurisdiction from or to which a payment is
made by or on behalf of any Credit Party or by any federation or organization of
which the United States of America or any such jurisdiction is a member at the
time of payment.

         (b)      If any Credit Party or any other Person is required by law to
make any deduction or withholding on account of any such Tax from any sum paid
or payable by any Credit Party to Administrative Agent or any Lender under any
of the Credit Documents: (i) Company shall notify Administrative Agent of any
such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as Company
becomes aware of it; (ii) Company shall pay any such Tax before the date on
which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay
is imposed on any Credit Party) for its own account or (if that liability is
imposed on Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be) on behalf of
and in the name of Administrative Agent or such Lender; (iii) the sum payable by
such Credit Party in respect of which the relevant deduction, withholding or
payment is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that,
after the making of that deduction, withholding or payment, Administrative Agent
or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to
what it would have received had no such deduction, withholding or payment been
required or made; and (iv) within thirty (30) days after paying any sum from
which it is required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and within 30
days after the due date of payment of any Tax which it is required by clause
(ii) above to pay, Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction,
withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or
other authority; provided, no such additional amount shall be required to be
paid to any Lender or any Agent under clause (iii) above with respect to any
deductions or withholding applicable as of the date hereof (in the case of each
Lender and each Agent listed on the signature pages hereof) or the effective
date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender
or the date on which a successor Lender becomes a Lender, or the date a
successor Agent becomes an Agent (in the case of each other Lender or Agent) in
respect of payments to such Lender or such Agent.

         (c)      Each Lender and each Agent that is not a United States Person
(as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a "Non-US Lender") shall deliver to
Administrative Agent for transmission to Company, on or prior to the Closing
Date (in the case of each Lender and each Agent listed on the signature pages
hereof on the Closing Date) or on or prior to the

a successor Agent becomes an Agent (in the case of each other Lender and each
Agent): (i) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
W-8ECI (or any successor forms), properly completed and duly executed by such
Non-U.S. Lender, and such other documentation required under the Internal
Revenue Code to establish that such Non-U.S. Lender is not subject to deduction
or withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments
to such Non-U.S. Lender of principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable
under any of the Credit Documents, or (ii) if such Non-U.S. Lender is not a
"bank" or other Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI
pursuant to clause (i) above, a Certificate re Non-Bank Status together with two
original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form),
properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender, and such other
documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code to establish that such
Non-U.S. Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States
federal income tax with respect to any payments to such Non-U.S. Lender of
interest payable under any of the Credit Documents. Each Non-U.S. Lender
required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to
United States federal income tax withholding matters pursuant to this Section
2.20(c) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial delivery by such
Non-U.S. Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence to promptly
deliver to Administrative Agent for transmission to Company two new original
copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or a Certificate re
Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN
(or successor forms or certificates as shall be adopted from time to time by the
relevant United States taxing authority), as the case may be, properly completed
and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender, and such other documentation required
under the Internal Revenue Code to confirm or establish that such Non-U.S.
Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax with respect to payments to such Non-U.S. Lender under the Credit
Documents, (i) on or before the date that any such previously provided forms,
certificates or evidence expires or becomes inaccurate, (ii) whenever a lapse in
time or change in circumstances renders such previously provided forms,
certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate and (iii) from time to
time thereafter if reasonably requested by Company or Administrative Agent, or
to notify Administrative Agent and Company of its inability to deliver any such
forms, certificates or other evidence. Company and each other Credit Party shall
not be required to pay any additional amount to any Non-US Lender under Section
2.20(b)(iii) if such Non-U.S. Lender shall have (x) failed to deliver the forms,
certificates or other evidence referred to in this Section 2.20(c), or (y)
notified Administrative Agent and Company of its inability to deliver any such
forms, certificates or other evidence, as the case may be; provided, if such
Non-U.S. Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of the first sentence of
this Section 2.20(c) on the Closing Date or on the date of the Assignment
Agreement or the date of succession pursuant to which it became a Lender or an
Agent, as applicable, nothing in this last sentence of Section 2.20(c) shall
relieve Company and each other Credit Party of its obligation to pay any
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.20 in the event that, as a result
of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or

order, or any change in the interpretation, administration or application
thereof, such Non-U.S. Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms,
certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that
such Non-U.S. Lender is not subject to withholding as described herein.

         (d)      Each Lender and each Agent that is not a Non-US Lender (a "US
LENDER") shall deliver to Administrative Agent and Company two original copies
of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 properly completed and duly executed by
such US Lender on or prior to the Closing Date (or on or prior to the date it
becomes a party to this Agreement), certifying that such US Lender is entitled
to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax, or any successor
form. Each US Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other
evidence with respect to United States backup withholding tax matters pursuant
to this Section 2.20(d) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial
delivery by such US Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, that
such US Lender shall promptly deliver to Administrative Agent for transmission
to Company two new original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9,
properly completed and duly executed by such US Lender, together with any other
certificate or statement of exemption required in order to confirm or establish
that such US Lender is exempt from United States backup withholding tax with
respect to payments to such US Lender under any of the Credit Documents (i) on
or before the date that any such previously provided forms, certificates or
other evidence expires or becomes obsolete, (ii) whenever a lapse in time or
change in circumstances render such previously provided forms, certificates or
other evidence obsolete or inaccurate, and (iii) from time to time thereafter if
reasonably requested by Company or Administrative Agent, or shall notify
Administrative Agent and Company of its inability to deliver any such forms,
certificates or other evidence. Company and each other Credit Party shall not be
required to pay any additional amount to any US Lender under Section
2.20(b)(iii) to the extent deduction or withholding is a result of such US
Lender's failure to provide an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 establishing
that such US Lender is exempt from United States backup withholding tax;
provided, if such US Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of this
Section 2.20(d) on the Closing Date or on the date of the Assignment Agreement
or on the date of the succession pursuant to which it became a Lender or an
Agent, as applicable, nothing in this last sentence of Section 2.20(d) shall
relieve Company and each other Credit Party of its obligation to pay any
additional amounts otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.20(b)(iii) in the
event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or
governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
administration or application thereof, such US Lender is no longer properly
entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date
establishing the fact that such US Lender is not subject to United States backup
withholding tax as described herein. If such US Lender fails to deliver such
forms, then Company may withhold from any payment to such US Lender an amount
equal to the applicable backup withholding tax imposed by the Internal Revenue
Code.

         (e)      If any Lender or any Agent determines that it has received a
refund in respect of any Taxes as to which additional amounts have been paid to
it by Company pursuant to Section 2.20(b)(iii), it shall promptly remit such
refund (including any

Company, upon request of such Lender or such Agent, as the case may be, agrees
to promptly return such refund to such party in the event such party is required
to repay such refund to the relevant taxing authority. Such Lender or such
Agent, as the case may be, shall, at Company's request, provide Company with a
copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to repay
such refund received from the relevant taxing authority (provided that such
Lender or such Agent, as the case may be, may delete any information therein
that such Lender or such Agent, as the case may be, deems confidential).

         (f)      For purposes of this Section 2.20, the term "Lender" shall
include Issuing Bank.

         2.21     CAPITAL ADEQUACY ADJUSTMENT. If any Lender (which term shall
include Issuing Bank for purposes of this Section 2.21) shall have determined
that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after the date
hereof of any law, rule or regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding
capital adequacy, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Lender (or its applicable lending office) with any guideline, request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or
any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference
to, such Lender's Loans or Commitments or Letters of Credit or participations
therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or the Letters
of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling
corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase-in,
applicability, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of
such Lender or such controlling corporation with regard to capital adequacy),
then from time to time, within five (5) Business Days after receipt by Company
from such Lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, Company
shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or such controlling corporation on an after-tax basis for such
reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative
Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the
calculation of such additional amounts, which statement shall be conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto absent demonstrable error.

         2.22     OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE. Each Lender (which term shall include
Issuing Bank for purposes of this Section 2.22) agrees that, as promptly as
practicable after the officer of such Lender responsible for administering its
Loans or Letters of Credit, as the case may be, becomes aware of the occurrence
of an event or the existence of a condition that would cause such Lender to
become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender to receive payments
under Section 2.19, 2.20 or 2.21, it will, to the extent not inconsistent with
the internal policies of such Lender and any applicable legal or regulatory
restrictions, use reasonable efforts (i) to make, issue, fund or maintain its

Credit Extensions, including any Affected Loans, through another office of such
Lender, or (ii) take such other measures as such Lender may deem reasonable, if
as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an
Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would
otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.19, 2.20
or 2.21 would be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender in its
sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such
Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit through such other office or in
accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise
materially adversely affect such Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit or the
interests of such Lender; provided, such Lender will not be obligated to utilize
such other office pursuant to this Section 2.22 unless Company agrees to pay all
incremental expenses incurred by such Lender as a result of utilizing such other
office as described in clause (i) above. A certificate as to the amount of any
such expenses payable by Company pursuant to this Section 2.22 (setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender
to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent
demonstrable error. With respect to any Lender's claim for compensation under
Sections 2.19, 2.20 or 2.21, Company shall not be required to compensate such
Lender for any amount incurred more than ninety (90) days prior to the date that
such Lender becomes aware of the event that gives rise to such claim.

         2.23     DEFAULTING LENDERS. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, in the event that any Lender (a "DEFAULTING LENDER") defaults
(a "FUNDING DEFAULT") in its obligation to fund any Revolving Loan (a "DEFAULTED
REVOLVING LOAN") as a result of the appointment of a receiver or conservator
with respect to such Lender at the direction or request of any regulatory agency
or authority, then (a) during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting
Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" for purposes
of voting on any matters (including the granting of any consents or waivers)
with respect to any of the Credit Documents; (b) to the extent permitted by
applicable law, until such time as the Default Excess with respect to such
Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero, (i) any voluntary prepayment
of the Revolving Loans shall, if Company so directs at the time of making such
voluntary prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of other Lenders as if
such Defaulting Lender had no Revolving Loans outstanding and the Revolving
Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender were zero, and (ii) any mandatory
prepayment of the Revolving Loans shall, if Company so directs at the time of
making such mandatory prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of other
Lenders (but not to the Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender) as if such
Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting
Lender, it being understood and agreed that Company shall be entitled to retain
any portion of any mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans that is not paid
to such Defaulting Lender solely as a result of the operation of the provisions
of this clause (b); (c) such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment and
outstanding Revolving Loans and such Defaulting Lender's applicable Pro Rata
Share of the Letter of Credit Usage shall be excluded for purposes of
calculating the commitment fee payable to Lenders pursuant to Section 2.10 in

SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         In order to induce Lenders and Issuing Bank to enter into this
Agreement and to make each Credit Extension to be made thereby, Company
represents and warrants to each Lender (after giving effect to the consummation
of the Acquisition and the Mergers) as follows:

         4.1      ORGANIZATION AND POWERS. Each Credit Party is a corporation,
limited liability company or limited partnership, as applicable, duly organized
or formed, as applicable, validly existing and, to the extent such concept
applies, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
formation, as applicable. Each Credit Party has all requisite corporate or other
organizational power and authority to own and operate its properties, to carry
on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to enter into
the Credit Documents to which it is a party and to carry out the transactions
contemplated thereby.

         4.2      QUALIFICATION AND GOOD STANDING. Each Credit Party is
qualified to do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction where its
assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out its business and
operations, except in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing has not had and could not be reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         4.3      SUBSIDIARIES. As of the Closing Date, all of the Subsidiaries
of Holdings are identified in Schedule 4.1. As of the Closing Date, the issued
and outstanding capital stock of each of the Subsidiaries of Holdings identified
in Schedule 4.1 is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and none of such capital stock constitutes Margin Stock. Each of the
Subsidiaries of Holdings is a corporation, limited liability company or limited
partnership, as applicable, duly organized or formed, as applicable, validly
existing, to the extent such concept applies, and in good standing under the

its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to
be conducted, and is qualified to do business and in good standing in every
jurisdiction where its assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out
its business and operations, in each case except where failure to be so
qualified or in good standing or a lack of such corporate power and authority
has not had and could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. As of the Closing Date, Schedule 4.1 correctly sets forth the ownership
interest of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries in each of the Subsidiaries of
Holdings identified therein.

         4.4      AUTHORIZATION OF BORROWING; NO CONFLICT. The execution,
delivery and performance of the Credit Documents have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership, as
applicable, action on the part of each Credit Party that is a party thereto. The
execution, delivery and performance by Credit Parties of the Credit Documents to
which they are parties and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Credit Documents do not and will not (a) violate any provision of any law or
any governmental rule or regulation applicable to Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Certificate or Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or
equivalent constituent documents) of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or any
order, judgment or decree of any court or other agency of government binding on
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent such violation could
not be reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (b) conflict
with, result in a breach of or constitute ( with due notice or lapse of time or
both) a default under any Contractual Obligation of Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, unless, solely with respect to the consummation of the Acquisition
and the Mergers, such conflict, breach or default could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (c) result in or require the
creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Liens created under any of
the Credit Documents in favor of Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured
Parties), or (d) require any approval of stockholders or any approval or consent
of any Person under any Contractual Obligation of Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such approvals or consents which will be obtained on or
before the Closing Date and disclosed in writing to Lenders and except for any
such consents or approvals the failure of which to obtain would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.5      GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. The execution, delivery and performance
by Credit Parties of the Credit Documents to which they are parties and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do not and
will not require any 4.1

legally valid and binding obligation of such Credit Party, enforceable against

with their terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors'
rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability. The
subordination provisions of the Senior Subordinated Note Documents will be

definition of "Senior Debt" included in the Senior Subordinated Note Documents.
The Senior Subordinated Notes, when issued and sold, will either (a) have been
registered or qualified under applicable federal and state securities laws or
(b) be exempt therefrom.

         4.8      FINANCIAL CONDITION. Company has heretofore delivered to

Subsidiaries have, subject to Permitted Liens, (a) good, sufficient and legal
title to (in the case of fee interests in real property); (b) valid leasehold

and (ii) all leases or subleases (together with all amendments, modifications,
supplements, renewals or extensions of any thereof) affecting or comprising each

Collateral Documents by Credit Parties, together with (i) the actions taken on
or prior to the date hereof pursuant to Section 3 and Section 5 and (ii) the
delivery to Collateral Agent of any Pledged Collateral not delivered to
Collateral Agent at the time of execution and delivery of the applicable
Collateral Document (all of which Pledged Collateral has been so delivered in

nor any of their respective Facilities or operations are subject to any
outstanding written order, consent decree or settlement agreement with any
Person relating to (a) any Environmental Law, (b) any Environmental Claim, or
(c) any Hazardous Materials Activity that, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Holdings
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any letter or request for information
under Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act (42 U.S.C. Section 9604) or any comparable state law which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are and, to
Company's knowledge, have been no conditions, occurrences, or Hazardous
Materials Activities which could reasonably be expected to form the basis of an

<PAGE>

Environmental Claim against Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
Company's knowledge, any predecessor of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries has
treated, stored or disposed of any hazardous waste at any Facility, and none of
Holdings' or any of its Subsidiaries' operations involves the treatment, storage
or disposal of hazardous waste that, in each case, would require a permit under
RCRA. Compliance with all current or reasonably foreseeable future requirements
pursuant to or under Environmental Laws will not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a reasonable possibility of giving rise to a Material Adverse
Effect. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.14 to the contrary, no event
or condition has occurred or is occurring with respect to Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to any Environmental Law, any Release of Hazardous
Materials, or any Hazardous Materials Activity which individually or in the
aggregate has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         4.15     NO DEFAULTS. Neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any of its Contractual
Obligations, and no condition exists that, with the giving of notice or the
lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default, except, in either case,
where the consequences, direct or indirect, of such default or defaults, if any,
could not be reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.16     GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. Neither Holdings nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or
under any other federal or state statute or regulation which may limit its
ability to incur Indebtedness or which may otherwise render all or any portion
of the Obligations unenforceable.

         4.17     MARGIN STOCK. Neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries is
engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. No
part of the proceeds of the Loans made to such Credit Party will be used to
purchase or carry any such Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any such Margin Stock or for any purpose that
violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

         4.18     EMPLOYEE MATTERS. There is no strike or work stoppage in
existence or threatened involving Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.19     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Company, each of its Subsidiaries and
each of their respective ERISA Affiliates are in compliance with all applicable
previsions and requirements of ERISA and the regulations and published
interpretations thereunder with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, and have
performed in all material respects all their obligations under each Employee
Benefit Plan, except for such noncompliance which, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a

Material Adverse Effect. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is so qualified or
will be qualified by admission of such Plan for an IRS determination in a timely
fashion, if not already submitted, and the timely making of such amendments as
may be required as a condition for issuance of a favorable determination. No
ERISA Event has occurred or as of the date hereof is reasonable expected to
occur where such Event individually or in the aggregate would have a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the most recent valuation date for any Pension Plan, any
amount of unfunded benefit liabilities (as defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of
ERISA "UNFUNDED BENEFIT LIABILITIES"), individually or in the aggregate for all
Pension Plans (except for purposes of such computation any Pension Plans with
respect to which assets exceed benefit liabilities), could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Company, its Subsidiaries
nor their respective ERISA Affiliates has completely or partially withdrawn from
any Multiemployer Plan, or incurred termination liability to the PBGC or
withdrawal liability to any Multiemployer Plan. As of the most recent valuation
date for each Multiemployer Plan for which the actuarial report is available,
the potential liability of Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA
Affiliates for a complete withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan (within the
meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA), when aggregated with such potential liability
for a complete withdrawal from all Multiemployer Plans, based on information
available pursuant to Section 4221(e) of ERISA, could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.20     [RESERVED].

         4.21     SOLVENCY. Each Credit Party is and, upon the incurrence of any

         4.22     CERTAIN RELATED AGREEMENTS. Holdings and Company have

exhibits and schedules thereto as of the date hereof.

         4.23     [RESERVED].

         4.24     DISCLOSURE. No written information, reports, financial
statements, certificates or exhibits (other than any Projections) furnished to
Lenders by or on behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, when taken as a whole,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact (known to Company, in the case of any document not furnished by it)
necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not
materially misleading in light of the circumstances in which the same were made.
Any projections and pro forma financial information (collectively, the
"PROJECTIONS") contained in such materials are based upon good faith estimates
and assumptions believed by Company to be reasonable at the time made, it being
recognized by Lenders that such Projections as to future events are not to be
viewed as facts and that

actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections may
differ from the projected results. There are no facts known to Company (other
than matters of a general economic nature) that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
and that have not been disclosed herein or in such other documents, certificates
and statements furnished to Lenders for use in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         4.25     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Each of the Credit Parties owns or has
the valid right to use all Intellectual Property free and clear of any and all
Liens other than Permitted Liens. All registrations therefor are in full force
and effect and are valid and enforceable, except as could not be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. To each Credit Party's knowledge, the conduct of
the business of each Credit Party as currently conducted, including, but not
limited to, all products, processes, or services, made, offered or sold by each
such Credit Party, does not infringe upon, violate, misappropriate or dilute any
intellectual property of any third party which infringement is likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. To the Credit Parties' knowledge, no third party is
infringing upon the Intellectual Property in any manner which could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no pending or, to each
Credit Party's knowledge, threatened claim or litigation contesting any Credit
Party's right to own or use any Intellectual Property or the validity or
enforceability thereof which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

recording of any of the foregoing, title insurance with respect to any of the

determine, in its reasonable discretion, that the cost of obtaining such Lien
(including any mortgage, stamp, intangibles or other tax) are excessive in
relation to the benefit to the Lenders of the security afforded thereby.

         5.14     EXECUTION OF CREDIT DOCUMENTS. Immediately following the

SECTION 7. GUARANTY

         7.1      GUARANTY OF THE OBLIGATIONS. Subject to the provisions of
Section 7.2, Guarantors jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guaranty the due and punctual payment in full of all Obligations
(including Hedge Agreements) of Company when the same shall become due, whether
at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or
otherwise, including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the
automatic stay under Section 362(a) or any other provision of the Bankruptcy
Code (the "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS").

         7.2      LIMITATION ON AMOUNT GUARANTIED. (a) Anything contained herein
to the contrary notwithstanding, if any Fraudulent Transfer Law (as hereinafter
defined) is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be applicable to
the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder, such obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest
amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United
States Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively,
the "FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAWS "), in each case after giving effect to all other
liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under
the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities
of such Guarantor (x) in respect of intercompany indebtedness to Company or
other affiliates of Company to the extent that such indebtedness would be
discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder and
(y) under any guaranty of Subordinated Indebtedness which guaranty contains a
limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this Section
7.2(a), pursuant to which the liability of such Guarantor hereunder is included
in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and
after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable
provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation,
reimbursement, indemnification or contribution of such Guarantor pursuant to
applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement (including any such
right of contribution hereunder).

         (b)      Guarantors under this Guaranty, together desire to allocate
among themselves, in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising
under this Guaranty. Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is
made on any date by any Guarantor under this Guaranty (a "FUNDING GUARANTOR")
that exceeds its Fair Share (as defined below) as of such date, that Funding
Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the other Guarantors
in the amount of such other Guarantor's Fair Share Shortfall (as defined below)
as of such date, with the result that all such contributions will cause each
Guarantor's Aggregate Payments (as defined below) to equal its Fair Share as of
such date. "FAIR SHARE" means, with respect to a Guarantor as of any date of
determination, an amount equal to (i) the ratio of (x) the Adjusted Maximum
Amount (as defined below) with respect to such Guarantor to (y) the aggregate of
the Adjusted Maximum Amounts with respect to all Guarantors multiplied by (ii)
the aggregate amount paid or distributed on or before such date by all Funding
Guarantors under this Guaranty in respect of the obligations guarantied. "FAIR
SHARE SHORTFALL" means, with

<PAGE>

respect to a Guarantor as of any date of determination, the excess, if any, of
the Fair Share of such Guarantor over the Aggregate Payments of such Guarantor.
"ADJUSTED MAXIMUM AMOUNT" means, with respect to a Guarantor as of any date of
determination, the maximum aggregate amount of the obligations of such Guarantor
under this Guaranty determined as of such date, in the case of any Guarantor, in
accordance with Section 7.2(a); provided that, solely for purposes of
calculating the "Adjusted Maximum Amount" with respect to any Guarantor for
purposes of this Section 7.2(b), any assets or liabilities of such Guarantor
arising by virtue of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification
or any rights to or obligations of contribution hereunder shall not be
considered as assets or liabilities of such Guarantor. "AGGREGATE PAYMENTS"
means, with respect to a Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount
equal to (i) the aggregate amount of all payments and distributions made on or
before such date by such Guarantor in respect of this Guaranty (including in
respect of this Section 7.2(b)) minus (ii) the aggregate amount of all payments
received on or before such date by such Guarantor from the other Guarantors as
contributions under this Section 7.2(b). The amounts payable as contributions
hereunder shall be determined as of the date on which the related payment or
distribution is made by the applicable Funding Guarantor. The allocation among
Guarantors of their obligations as set forth in this Section 7.2(b) shall not be
construed in any way to limit the liability of any Guarantor hereunder.

         7.3      PAYMENT BY GUARANTORS. Subject to Section 7.2(a), Guarantors
hereby jointly and severally agree, in furtherance of the foregoing and not in
limitation of any other right which any Beneficiary may have at law or in equity
against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of Company to pay
any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether
at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or
otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the
automatic stay under Section 362(a) or any other provision of the Bankruptcy
Code), Guarantors will upon demand pay, or cause to be paid, in Cash, to
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of Beneficiaries, an amount equal
to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of all Guaranteed Obligations then due
as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations
(including interest which, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with
respect to Company, would have accrued on such Guaranteed Obligations, whether
or not a claim is allowed against Company for such interest in the related
bankruptcy proceeding) and all other Guaranteed Obligations then owed to
Beneficiaries as aforesaid.

         7.4      LIABILITY OF GUARANTORS ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor agrees that,
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, its obligations hereunder are
irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional, and constitute primary
obligations of such Guarantor and not a contract of surety, and shall not be
affected by any circumstance which constitutes a legal or equitable discharge of
a guarantor or surety other than payment in full in Cash of the Guaranteed
Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality
thereof, each Guarantor agrees that, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law,

         (a)      this Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when due and not of
collectibility;

<PAGE>

         (b)      the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of
the obligations of Company and the obligations of any other guarantor (including
any other Guarantor) of the obligations of Company, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against such Guarantor whether or not any
action is brought against Company or any of such other guarantors and whether or
not Company is joined in any such action or actions;

         (c)      payment by any Guarantor of a portion, but not all, of the
Guaranteed Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge any
Guarantor's liability for any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which has
not been paid. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if
Administrative Agent is awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce any
Guarantor's covenant to pay a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations, such
judgment shall not be deemed to release such Guarantor from its covenant to pay
the portion of the Guaranteed Obligations that is not the subject of such suit,
and such judgment shall not, except to the extent satisfied by such Guarantor,
limit, affect, modify or abridge any other Guarantor's liability hereunder in
respect of the Guaranteed Obligations;

         (d)      any Beneficiary, upon such terms as it deems appropriate,
without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability
hereof or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or
termination of any Guarantor's liability hereunder, from time to time may (i)
renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change
the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii)
settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse any offer of
performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or
any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of the same to the
payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of
the Guaranteed Obligations and take and hold security for the payment of this
Guaranty or the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) release, surrender, exchange,
substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify,
with or without consideration, any security for payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other
obligation of any Person (including any other Guarantor) with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations (provided that no Credit Document to which such Guarantor
is a party may be amended without its written consent); (v) enforce and apply
any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of such Beneficiary in
respect of this Guaranty or the Guaranteed Obligations and direct the order or
manner of sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that such
Beneficiary may have against any such security, in each case as such Beneficiary
in its discretion may determine consistent with this Agreement or the applicable
Hedge Agreement and any applicable security agreement, including foreclosure on
any such security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether
or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable, and even though
such action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or
subrogation or other right or remedy of any Guarantor against Company or any
security for the Guaranteed Obligations; and (vi) exercise any other rights
available to it under the Credit Documents or the applicable Hedge Agreements;

limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason (other than
payment in full in Cash of the Guaranteed Obligations), including the occurrence
of any of the following, whether or not any Guarantor shall have had notice or
knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert or enforce or
agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay or enjoining, by
order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement
of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether arising under the
Credit Documents or the Hedge Agreements, at law, in equity or otherwise) with

Obligations; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any

relating to events of default) of this Agreement, any of the other Credit

pursuant thereto, or of any other guaranty or security for the Guaranteed
Obligations, in each case whether or not in accordance with the terms of this

which such Guarantor is a party may be amended without its written consent);

pursuant to the other Credit Documents or any of the Hedge Agreements or from
the proceeds of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, except to the
extent such security also serves as collateral for indebtedness other than the
Guaranteed Obligations) to the payment of indebtedness other than the Guaranteed

of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) any defenses, set-offs or counterclaims
which Company may allege or assert against any Beneficiary in respect of the
Guaranteed Obligations, including failure of consideration, breach of warranty,
statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury;
and (viii) any other act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or
thing, which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any
Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations.

         7.5      Waivers by Guarantors. Each Guarantor hereby waives, for the
benefit of Beneficiaries, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law: (a)

(including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other

the power of any Beneficiary whatsoever; (b) any defense arising by reason of
the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of Company
including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the
unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement or instrument
relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of Company from
any cause other than payment in full in Cash of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c)
any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the
obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects
more burdensome than that of the principal; (d) any defense based upon any
Beneficiary's errors or omissions in the administration of the Guaranteed
Obligations, except behavior which amounts to gross negligence or willful
misconduct or bad faith; (e) (i) any principles or provisions of law, statutory
or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof and any

         7.6      GUARANTORS' RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION, CONTRIBUTION, ETC. Each
Guarantor hereby waives, until the Termination Date, any claim, right or remedy,
direct or indirect, that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against
Company or any of its assets in connection herewith or the performance by such
Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right
or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute under common law or
otherwise and including (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or
indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against
Company, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim, right or
remedy that any Beneficiary now has or may hereafter have against Company, and
(c) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security
now or hereafter held by any Beneficiary. In addition, until the Termination
Date, each Guarantor shall withhold exercise of any right of contribution such
Guarantor may have against any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor)
of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any such right of contribution under
Section 7.2(b)). Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or
agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement,
indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of
subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may have against
Company or against any collateral or security, and any rights of

contribution such Guarantor may have against any such other guarantor, shall be
junior and subordinate to any rights any Beneficiary may have against Company,
to all right, title and interest any Beneficiary may have in any such collateral
or security, and to any right any Beneficiary may have against such other
guarantor. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of any such
subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time
when the Termination Date shall not have occurred, such amount shall be held in
trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be
paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be
credited and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof.

         7.7      SUBORDINATION OF OTHER OBLIGATIONS. Any Indebtedness of
Company or any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor (the "Obligee
Guarantor") is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Guaranteed
Obligations, and any such indebtedness collected or received by the Obligee
Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held
in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith
be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be
credited and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations but without affecting,
impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of the Obligee Guarantor under
any other provision hereof.

         7.8      CONTINUING GUARANTY. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty
and shall remain in effect until the Termination Date. Each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty as to future transactions
giving rise to any Guaranteed Obligations.

         7.9      AUTHORITY OF GUARANTORS OR COMPANY. It is not necessary for
any Beneficiary to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Guarantor or
Company or the officers, directors or any agents acting or purporting to act on
behalf of any of them.

         7.10     FINANCIAL CONDITION OF COMPANY AND GUARANTORS. Any Credit
Extension may be granted to Company or continued from time to time, and any
Hedge Agreements may be entered into from time to time, in each case without
notice to or authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or
other condition of Company or any other Guarantor at the time of any such grant
or continuation or at the time such Hedge Agreement is entered into, as the case
may be. No Beneficiary shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with any
Guarantor its assessment, or any Guarantor's assessment, of the financial
condition of Company or any other Guarantor. Each Guarantor has adequate means
to obtain information from Company and each other Guarantor on a continuing
basis concerning the financial condition of Company or such other Guarantor and
its ability to perform its obligations under the Credit Documents and the Hedge
Agreements, and each Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping
informed of the financial condition of Company and each other Guarantor and of
all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed
Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part
of any Beneficiary

to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or
conditions of Company or any other Guarantor now known or hereafter known by any
Beneficiary.

         7.11     BANKRUPTCY, ETC. (a) The obligations of Guarantors hereunder
shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or
terminated by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the
bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement
of Company or by any defense which Company may have by reason of the order,
decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such
proceeding.

         (b)      Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on
any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which accrues after the commencement
of any proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if interest on any
portion of the Guaranteed Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by
reason of the commencement of said proceeding, such interest as would have
accrued on such portion of the Guaranteed Obligations if said proceedings had
not been commenced) shall be included in the Guaranteed Obligations because it
is the intention of Guarantors and Beneficiaries that the Guaranteed Obligations
which are guarantied by Guarantors pursuant hereto should be determined without
regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve Company of any portion of
such Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantors will permit any trustee in bankruptcy,
receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar
person to pay Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of Administrative Agent
in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such
proceeding is commenced.

         (c)      In the event that all or any portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations are paid by Company, the obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall
continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may
be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or
recovered directly or indirectly from any Beneficiary as a preference,
fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded
or recovered shall constitute Guaranteed Obligations for all purposes hereunder;
provided that interest or fees on any such reinstated Guaranteed Obligations
shall not be payable for the period during which the Beneficiaries were paid
such funds until the date such funds were returned.

         7.12     DISCHARGE OF GUARANTY UPON SALE OF GUARANTOR. If all of the
stock of any Guarantor or any of its successors in interest hereunder shall be
sold or otherwise disposed of (including by merger or consolidation) in an Asset
Sale not prohibited by this Agreement or otherwise consented to by Requisite
Lenders, the Guaranty of such Guarantor or such successor in interest, as the
case may be, hereunder shall automatically be discharged and released without
any further action by any Beneficiary or any other Person effective as of the
time of such Asset Sale.

Lender to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder shall thereupon terminate, and
(2) upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any other Event of
Default, Administrative Agent shall, upon the written request or with the
written consent of Requisite Lenders, by written notice to Company, declare all

and the same shall forthwith become, immediately due and payable, and the
obligation of each Lender to make any Loan, the obligation of Issuing Bank to

as provided in Section 2.2(c).

         Company shall at such time deposit any amounts described in clause (B)
above in one or more cash collateral accounts opened by the Administrative
Agent. Company hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Issuing Bank and each Lender with a participation in such Letters of Credit, a
security interest in such cash collateral to secure all Obligations. Any amounts
held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit issued for the
account of Company, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of
Credit shall have expired, been fully drawn upon or back-stopped, if any, shall
(i) to the extent an Event of Default then exists, be applied to repay the other
Obligations or (ii) shall otherwise be immediately returned to Company. After
all such Letters of Credit shall have expired, been fully drawn upon or
back-stopped and all non-contingent Obligations shall have been satisfied and
paid in full in Cash, the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall
be returned to Company. Company shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank and the Lenders with
participations in such Letters of Credit, such further documents and instruments
as the Administrative Agent may request to evidence the creation and perfection
of the within security interest in such cash collateral account.

         8.2      CERTAIN OPTION OF LENDERS. Notwithstanding anything contained
in Section 8.1, if at any time within sixty (60) days after an acceleration of
the Loans pursuant to such Section, Company shall pay all arrears of interest
and all payments on account of principal which shall have become due otherwise
than as a result of such acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the
extent permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the rates specified herein) and
all Events of Default and Defaults (other than non-payment of the principal of
and accrued interest on the Loans, in each case which is due and payable solely
by virtue of acceleration) shall be remedied or waived pursuant to Section 10.5,
then Requisite Lenders, by written notice to Company, may at their option
rescind and annul such acceleration and its consequences; but such action shall
not affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right
consequent thereon. The provisions of this Section 8.2 are intended merely to
bind Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election of Requisite
Lenders and are not intended, directly or indirectly, to benefit Company, and
such provisions shall not at any time be construed so as to grant Company the
right to require Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder or to
preclude Administrative Agent or Lenders from exercising any of the

rights or remedies available to them under any of the Credit Documents, even if
the conditions set forth in this Section 8.2 are met.

         8.3      COMPANY'S RIGHT TO CURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.1, in the event
that Company fails to comply with the requirements of any Financial Performance
Covenant, until the 10th day subsequent to delivery of the related Compliance
Certificate, Holdings shall have the right, but in any event no more than (i)
two (2) times in any twelve-month period and (ii) four (4) times from the
Closing Date to the date of determination, to issue Permitted Cure Securities
for cash or otherwise receive cash contributions to the capital of Holdings, in
either case in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (a) the amount
necessary to cure the relevant failure to comply with all the Financial
Performance Covenants and (b) $20,000,000, and, in each case, to contribute any
such cash to the capital of Company (collectively, the "CURE RIGHT"), and upon
the receipt by Company of such cash (the "CURE AMOUNT") pursuant to the exercise
by Holdings of such Cure Right such Financial Performance Covenant shall be
recalculated giving effect to the following pro forma adjustments:

                  (i)      Consolidated EBITDA shall be increased, in accordance
         with the definition thereof, solely for the purpose of measuring the
         Financial Performance Covenants and not for any other purpose under
         this Agreement, by an amount equal to the Cure Amount;

                  (ii)     if, after giving effect to the foregoing
         recalculations, Company shall then be in compliance with the
         requirements of all Financial Performance Covenants, Company shall be
         deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the Financial Performance
         Covenants as of the relevant date of determination with the same effect
         as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date,
         and the applicable breach or default of the Financial Performance
         Covenants which had occurred shall be deemed cured for all purposes of
         the Agreement; and

                  (iii)    to the extent that the Cure Amount proceeds are used
         to repay Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall not be deemed to have
         been repaid for purposes of calculating the Leverage Ratio for the
         period with respect to which such Compliance Certificate applies.

other Credit Documents. DBNY is hereby appointed Administrative Agent hereunder
and under the other Credit Documents and each Lender hereby authorizes
Administrative Agent to act as its agent in accordance with the terms hereof and
the other Credit Documents. Each Agent hereby agrees to act upon the express
conditions contained herein and in the other Credit Documents, as applicable.
The provisions of this Section 9 are solely for the benefit of Agents and
Lenders and no Credit Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary
of any of the provisions thereof, except as provided in Sections 9.7 and 9.8. In
performing its functions and duties hereunder, each Agent shall act solely as an
agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any
obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for Holdings,
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, except as provided in Section
2.6 as to Administrative Agent with respect to maintaining the Register.
Co-Syndication Agents and Co-Documentation Agents, without consent of or notice
to any party hereto, may assign any and all of their respective rights or
obligations hereunder to any of their respective Affiliates. As of the Closing
Date, neither GSCP, in its capacity as Co-Syndication Agent and a Joint Lead
Arranger, UBSS as Co-Syndication Agent and a Joint Lead Arranger, nor GE Capital
and CIT as Co-Documentation Agents shall have any obligations but shall be
entitled to all benefits of this Section 9.

         9.2      POWERS AND DUTIES. Each Lender irrevocably authorizes each
Agent to take such action on such Lender's behalf and to exercise such powers,
rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Credit Documents as are
specifically delegated or granted to such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,
together with such powers, rights and remedies as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Each Agent shall have only those duties and responsibilities that are
expressly specified herein and in the other Credit Documents. Each Agent may
exercise such powers, rights and remedies and perform such duties by or through
its agents or employees. No Agent shall have, by reason hereof or of any of the
other Credit Documents, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and
nothing herein or in any of the other Credit Documents, expressed or implied, is
intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon any Agent any obligations
in respect hereof or of any of the other Credit Documents except as expressly
set forth herein or therein.

         9.3      GENERAL IMMUNITY. (a) No Agent shall be responsible to any
Lender for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectibility or sufficiency hereof or of any other Credit Document or for any
representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or
made in any written or oral statements or in any financial or other statements,
instruments, reports or certificates or any other documents furnished or made by
any Agent to Lenders or by or on behalf of Company to any Agent or any Lender in
connection with the Credit Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby
or for the financial condition or business affairs of any Credit Party or any
other Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall any Agent be
required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of
the Credit Documents or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or as to the
existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Default. Anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Administrative Agent shall not
have any liability arising from

confirmations of the amount of outstanding Loans or the Letter of Credit Usage
or the component amounts thereof.

         (b)      None of Agents nor any of their respective officers, partners,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable to Lenders for any action taken
or omitted by any Agent under or in connection with any of the Credit Documents
except to the extent caused by such Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Each Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking
of any action (including the failure to take an action) in connection herewith
or with any of the other Credit Documents or from the exercise of any power,
discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until
such Agent shall have received instructions in respect thereof from Requisite
Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions
under Section 10.5) and, upon receipt of such instructions from Requisite
Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be), such Agent shall be
entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise
such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such instructions.
Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and shall be
entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and judgments of
attorneys (who may be attorneys for Company and its Subsidiaries), accountants,
experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no Lender shall
have any right of action whatsoever against any Agent as a result of such Agent
acting or (where so instructed) refraining from acting hereunder or under any of
the other Credit Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite
Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions
under Section 10.5).

         9.4      AGENT ENTITLED TO ACT AS LENDER. The agency hereby created
shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or impose any
duties or obligations upon, any Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender
hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Loans and the Letters of
Credit, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not performing the duties and
functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" or any
similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include each
Agent in its individual capacity. Any Agent and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory or other business with Company or any of its Affiliates as if
it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and
other consideration from Company for services in connection herewith and
otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders.

         9.5      LENDERS' REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         (a)      Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this
Agreement or a Joinder Agreement and funding its Tranche B Term Loan and/or
Revolving Loans on the Closing Date or by the funding of any New Loans, as the
case may be, shall be deemed to

have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Credit
Document and each other document required to be approved by any Agent, Requisite
Lenders or Lenders, as applicable on the Closing Date or as of the date of
funding of such New Loans.

         (b)      Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the Credit Extensions thereof hereunder and
that it has made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the
creditworthiness of Company and its Subsidiaries. No Agent shall have any duty
or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such
investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming
into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times
thereafter, and no Agent shall have any responsibility with respect to the
accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to Lenders.

         9.6      RIGHT TO INDEMNITY. Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata
Share, severally agrees to indemnify each Agent, to the extent that such Agent
shall not have been reimbursed by Company, for and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of
any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against such Agent in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing
its duties hereunder or under the other Credit Documents or otherwise in its
capacity as such Agent in any way relating to or arising out hereof or of the
other Credit Documents; provided, no Lender shall be liable for any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If any indemnity furnished to any Agent for
any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Agent, be insufficient or become
impaired, such Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not
commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is
furnished; provided, in no event shall this sentence require any Lender to
indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty,
action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in excess of such Lender's
Pro Rata Share thereof; and provided further, this sentence shall not be deemed
to require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation,
loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement
described in the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence.

         9.7      SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND SWING LINE LENDER. (a)

notice thereof to Lenders and Company, and Administrative Agent may be removed
at any time with or without cause by an instrument or concurrent instruments in

Lenders. Upon any such notice of resignation or any such removal, Requisite
Lenders shall have the right, upon five Business Days' notice to Company, to
appoint a successor Administrative Agent, provided that Company shall have the
right to approve any such successor Administrative

Agent unless an Event of Default then exists under Sections 8.1 (a), 8.1(f) or
(g). Upon the approval by Company (if required hereunder) acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative
Agent, that successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any
retiring or removed Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent hereunder.

         (b)      Swing Line Lender may resign at any time by giving 30 days'
prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Company. Upon any such notice of
resignation Administrative Agent shall have the right, upon five Business Days'
notice to Company, to appoint a successor Swing Line Lender from among the
Lenders, provided that Company shall have the right to approve any such
successor Administrative Agent unless an Event of Default then exists under
Sections 8.1 (a), 8.1(f) or (g). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Swing
Line Lender hereunder by a successor Swing Line Lender, that successor Swing
Line Lender shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swing Line Lender and the retiring
Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.
In such event (i) Company shall prepay any outstanding Swing Line Loans made by
the retiring Swing Line Lender, (ii) upon such prepayment, the retiring Swing
Line Lender shall surrender the Swing Line Note held by it to Company for
cancellation, and (iii) Company shall issue a new Swing Line Note to the
successor Swing Line Lender, in the principal amount of the Swing Line Loan
Commitment then in effect and with other appropriate insertions.

         9.8      COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS AND GUARANTIES. (a) Each Lender hereby
further authorizes Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, on
behalf of and for the benefit of the Secured Parties, to enter into each
Collateral Document as secured party and to be the agent for and representative
of Lenders with respect to the Guaranty and the Collateral, and each Lender
agrees to be bound by the terms of each Collateral Document. Subject to Section
10.5, without further written consent or authorization from Lenders,
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, may execute any
documents or instruments necessary to (i) release any Lien encumbering any item
of Collateral that is the subject of a sale or other disposition of assets
permitted hereby or to which Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be
required to give such consent under Section 10.5) have otherwise consented or
(ii) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from the Guaranty if all of the capital
stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor is sold to any Person (other than an
Affiliate of Company) pursuant to a sale or other disposition permitted
hereunder or to which Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be
required to give such consent under Section 10.5) have otherwise consented or
(iii) subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by Collateral
Agent under the Credit Documents to the holder of any Lien on such property that
is permitted under (x) Section 6.2(c), (y) Section 6.2(f) and (z) any other
Section of Section 6.2, so long as

such Lien is granted in connection with the issuance or incurrence Indebtedness
permitted by Section 6.1 and the proceeds of such Indebtedness are used to
purchase assets (including by means of a Capital Lease) or to refinance
Indebtedness which was previously used to purchase assets (including any Capital
Lease); provided that such subordination shall only cover the respective
property so acquired and the proceeds and products thereof.

         (b)      Anything contained in any of the Credit Documents to the
contrary notwithstanding, Company, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and
each Lender hereby agree that (i) no Lender shall have any right individually to
realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guaranty, it being
understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under
the Collateral Documents may be exercised solely by Administrative Agent for the
benefit of Lenders in accordance with the terms hereof, and (II) in the event of
a foreclosure by Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public
or private sale, Collateral Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or
all of such Collateral at any such sale and Collateral Agent, as agent for and
representative of Lenders (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their
respective individual capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise agree
in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement
or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold
at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on
account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by Collateral Agent at
such sale.

         (c)      It is the purpose hereof and of the other Credit Documents
that there shall be no violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or
restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact
business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case
of litigation hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents, and in
particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Credit Documents, or in case
Collateral Agent deems that by reason of any present or future law of any
jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted
herein or in any of the other Credit Documents or take any other action which
may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that
Collateral Agent appoint an additional individual or institution as a separate
trustee, co-trustee, collateral agent or collateral co-agent (a "SUPPLEMENTAL
COLLATERAL AGENT"). In the event that Collateral Agent appoints a Supplemental
Collateral Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right,
power, privilege or duty expressed or intended hereby or by any of the other
Credit Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to Collateral Agent
with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such
Supplemental Collateral Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary
to enable such Supplemental Collateral Agent to exercise such rights, powers and
privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with
respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the
Credit Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such
Supplemental Collateral Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either
Collateral Agent or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, and (II) the provisions
of this Section 9 and of Sections 10.2 and 10.3 that refer to Collateral Agent
shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Collateral Agent and all
references

therein to Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be references to Collateral Agent
and/or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the context may require. Should
any instrument in writing from Company or any other Credit Party be required by
any Supplemental Collateral Agent so appointed by Collateral Agent for more
fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers,
privileges and duties, Company shall, or shall cause such Credit Party to,
execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon
request by Collateral Agent. In case any Supplemental Collateral Agent, or a
successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed,
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Collateral
Agent, to the extent permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised by
Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral
Agent.

         (d)      Company and each Guarantor hereby authorize the Collateral
Agent to file any financing statements or continuation statements, and
amendments to financing statements in any jurisdictions and with any filing
offices as the Collateral Agent may determine, in its sole discretion, are
necessary or advisable to perfect or to maintain the perfection of the first
priority security interest granted to Collateral Agent under any of the Credit
Documents. Such financing statements may describe the Collateral in the same
manner as described in the Pledge and Security Agreement or may contain an
indication or description of collateral that describes such property in any
other manner as the Collateral Agent may determine, in its sole discretion, is
necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of the security
interest in the Collateral granted to the Collateral Agent under any of the
Credit Documents, including, without limitation, describing such property as
"all assets" or "all personal property, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired." Collateral Agent will provide Company with file-stamped copies of any
such filings made by it.

upon any of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Guaranty) or in connection
with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided

bankruptcy proceedings.

         10.3     Indemnity. (a) In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant
to Section 10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated, Company and each Guarantor agree to defend (subject to Indemnitees'

indemnify, pay and hold harmless Agents and Lenders, and the officers, partners,
directors, trustees, employees, agents and affiliates of any of Agents and
Lenders (each, an "Indemnitee"), from and against any and all Indemnified

Guarantor shall have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to
any Indemnified Liabilities (i) to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct or bad faith of that Indemnitee
or (ii) to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities relate to Taxes (and any
liabilities relating thereto), the indemnity for which shall be governed solely
and exclusively by Section 2.20. To the extent that the undertakings to defend,
indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in this Section 10.3 may be
unenforceable in whole or in part because they are violative of any law or
public policy, Company and the Guarantors shall contribute the maximum portion
that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and
satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of
them.

         (b)      Company and each Guarantor agree that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution could be sought under subsection (a) of this
section (whether or not any Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such
claim, action or proceeding) without the prior written consent of the applicable
Indemnitees, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such
claim, action or proceeding, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

         (c)      If an Indemnitee is requested or required to appear as a
witness in any action brought by or on behalf of or against Company, any
Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof in which such Indemnitee is not named as a
defendant, Company agrees to reimburse such Indemnitee for all reasonable
expenses incurred by it in connection with such Indemnitee's appearing and
preparing to appear as such a witness, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of its legal counsel.

         10.4     SET-OFF. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted
under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the

Administrative Agent, without notice to any Credit Party or to any other Person
(other than Administrative Agent), any such notice being hereby expressly
waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general
or special, including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether
matured or unmatured, but not including trust accounts) and any other
Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or
the account of such Credit Party against and on account of the obligations and
liabilities of such Credit Party to such Lender hereunder, the Letters of Credit
and participations therein and the other Credit Documents, including all claims
of any nature or description arising out of or connected herewith, the Letters
of Credit and participations therein or any other Credit Document, irrespective
of whether or not (a) such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (b)
the principal of or the interest on the Loans or any amounts in respect of the
Letters of Credit or any other amounts due hereunder shall have become due and
payable pursuant to Section 2 and although said obligations and liabilities, or
any of them, may be contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to

Company and Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by
such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set-off and application. Each Credit Party hereby
further grants to Administrative Agent and each Lender a security interest in

Administrative Agent or such Lender as security for the Obligations.

         10.5     AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. (a) Subject to Section 10.5(b),
Section 10.5(c) and Section 10.5(d), no amendment, modification, supplement or
waiver of any provision of the Credit Documents, or consent to any departure by
any Credit Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written
concurrence of Requisite Lenders.

         (b)      No amendment, modification, supplement or waiver of any
provision of the Credit Documents, or consent to any departure by any Credit
Party therefrom, shall extend the scheduled final maturity of any Loan or Note,

Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, or postpone the scheduled date of
expiration of any Commitment or reduce the rate of interest on any Loan (other

pursuant to Section 2.9) or any commitment fees or letter of credit fees payable
hereunder, or extend the time for payment of any such interest or fees, or
reduce the principal amount of any Loan or any reimbursement obligation in
respect of any Letter of Credit, or shall amend any provision of the Credit
Documents providing for pro rata treatment of Lenders in any such case without
the written consent of each Lender with Obligations affected thereby (it being
understood that any change to the definition of Leverage Ratio or in the
component definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction in any interest
rate or any such fee).

provision of the Credit Documents, or consent to any departure by any Credit
Party therefrom, shall (i) amend, modify, supplement or waive any provision of
this Section 10.5, (ii) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
"Requisite Lenders" or the definition of "Pro Rata Share" (it being understood
that, with the consent of Requisite Lenders, additional extensions of credit

are included on the Closing Date), (iii) release all or substantially all of the

amendment, modification or waiver of any condition precedent, covenant, Default
or Event of Default, and no increase in the available portion of any Commitment
of any Lender or the rescission of any acceleration pursuant to Section 8.2,
shall constitute an increase in the Commitment of any Lender); (ii) amend,
modify, terminate or waive any provision hereof relating to the Swing Line Loan
Commitment or the Swing Line Loans without the consent of Swing Line Lender;
(iii) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of "Requisite Class
Lenders" with respect to a particular Class without the consent of each Lender
of the affected Class, or otherwise amend the definition of "Requisite Class
Lenders" without the consent of Requisite Class Lenders of each Class (it being
understood that, with the consent of Requisite Lenders, additional extensions of
credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of
"Requisite Class Lenders" on substantially the same basis as the Term Loan
amounts, the Term Loans, the Revolving Loan Commitments and the Revolving Loans
are included on the Closing Date); (iv) alter the required application of any
repayments or prepayments as between Classes pursuant to Section 2.14 without
the consent of Requisite Class Lenders of each Class which is being allocated a
lesser repayment or prepayment as a result thereof (although Requisite Lenders
may waive, in whole or in part, any mandatory prepayment so long as the
application, as between Classes, of any portion of such prepayment which is
still required to be made is not altered); (v) amend, modify, terminate or waive
any obligation of Lenders relating to the purchase of participations in Letters
of Credit as provided in Section 2.3(e) without the written consent of
Administrative Agent and of Issuing Bank; or (vi) amend, modify, terminate or
waive any provision of Section 9 as the same applies to any Agent, or any other
provision hereof as the same applies to the rights or obligations of any Agent
without the consent of such Agent.

         (e)      Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to,
with the concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers
or consents on behalf of such Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was
given. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any
Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent
effected in accordance with this Section 10.5 shall be binding upon each Lender
at the time outstanding, each future Lender and, if signed by a Credit Party, on
such Credit Party.

         (f)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
this Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Administrative
Agent, Company, the holders of not less than 50.0% of the Revolving Credit
Exposure and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans to permit
the refinancing of all outstanding Tranche B Term Loans or any Series of New
Term Loans (the "REFINANCED TERM LOAN") with a replacement term loan tranche
hereunder (the "REPLACEMENT TERM LOANS"), provided that (a) the aggregate
principal amount of such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate
principal amount of such Refinanced Term Loan, (b) the interest rate for such
Replacement Term Loans shall not be higher than the interest rate for such
Refinanced Term Loan, (c) the weighted average life to maturity of such

maturity of such Refinanced Term Loan at the time of such refinancing and (d)
all other terms applicable to such Replacement Term Loans shall be substantially
identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement Term
Loans than those applicable to such Refinanced Term Loan, except to the extent
necessary to provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period
after the latest final maturity of the Term Loans in effect immediately prior to
such refinancing.

         10.6     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS. (a) This Agreement
shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors
and assigns of Lenders. Neither any Credit Party's rights or obligations
hereunder nor any interest therein may be assigned or delegated by any Credit
Party without the prior written consent of all Lenders.

         (b)      No assignment or transfer of any Commitment or Loan shall be
effective, in each case unless and until an Assignment Agreement effecting the
assignment or transfer thereof shall have been accepted by Administrative Agent
and recorded in the Register. Prior to such recordation, all amounts owed with
respect to the applicable Commitment or Loan shall be owed to the Lender listed
in the Register as the owner thereof, and any request, authority or consent of
any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding
on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the corresponding
Commitments or Loans.

         (c)      Each Lender shall have the right at any time to sell, assign
or transfer, in whole or in part, any Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or any
other Obligation: (i) upon the giving of notice to Administrative Agent, to
another Lender, or to an Affiliate of the assigning Lender (or if such assigning
Lender is a fund that invests in commercial or bank loans, another such
investment fund managed or advised by the same investment advisor or an
Affiliate thereof) or another Lender; or (ii) in the case of Term Loans (unless
otherwise covered by clause (i) hereof), with the consent of Company and
Administrative Agent (which consent of Company and Administrative Agent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to any other Eligible Assignee
(treating any two or more investment funds that invest in commercial loans and
that are managed or advised by the same investment advisor or by an Affiliate of
such investment advisor as a single Eligible Assignee), in an aggregate amount
of not less than $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as shall constitute the
aggregate amount of the Tranche B Term Loan, New Term Loans and other
Obligations of the assigning Lender); or (iii) in each other case, with the
consent of Company and Administrative Agent (which consent of Company and
Administrative Agent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to any other
Eligible Assignee (treating any two or more investment funds that invest in
commercial loans and that are managed or advised by the same investment advisor
or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor as a single Eligible Assignee), in
an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount as shall
constitute the aggregate amount of the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit and
participations therein, and other Obligations of the assigning Lender);
provided, however, that upon the occurrence and

during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to Sections 8.1(a),
8.1(f) and 8.1(g), the consent of Company shall not be required under clauses
(ii) and (iii) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Swing Line Loan
Commitment and the Swing Line Loans of Swing Line Lender may not be sold,
assigned or transferred except to the extent contemplated by Section 9.7(b).

         (d)      The assigning Lender and the assignee thereof shall execute
and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment Agreement, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $2,000 (treating any two or more investment
funds that invest in commercial loans and that are managed or advised by the
same investment advisor or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor as a
single Eligible Assignee) and such forms, certificates or other evidence, if
any, with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters as the
assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver to
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.20(c) and Section 2.20(d); provided,
that notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, no processing fee shall be
required to be paid with respect to assignments made pursuant to clause (ii) of
the definition of "Eligible Assignee". Subject to Section 10.6(b), upon its
receipt of a duly executed and completed Assignment Agreement, together with the
processing and recordation fee referred to herein and any forms, certificates or
other evidence that such assignee may be required hereunder to deliver to
Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent shall, if Administrative Agent and
Company have consented to the assignment evidenced thereby (in each case to the
extent such consent is required hereunder), (i) accept such Assignment Agreement
by executing a counterpart thereof as provided therein (which acceptance shall
evidence any required consent of Administrative Agent to such assignment), (ii)
record the information contained therein in the Register, and (iii) give prompt
notice thereof to Company. Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each
Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it as provided in this Section
10.6(d). Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the case
of an assignment to an Affiliate of the assigning Lender, such assignment shall
be effective between such assigning Lender and its Affiliate immediately without
compliance with the conditions for assignment under Sections 10.6(b) through
(d), but shall not be effective with respect to any Credit Party, Administrative
Agent, any other Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swing Line Lender or any Lender,
and each Credit Party, Administrative Agent, each other Agent, each Issuing
Bank, each Swing Line Lender and each Lender shall be entitled to deal solely
and directly with such assigning Lender under any such assignment, in each case,
until the conditions for assignment under Sections 10.6(b) through (d) have been
complied with.

         (e)      Each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof hereby
represents and warrants, and each Lender executing and delivering an Assignment
Agreement shall be deemed to represent and warrant as of the effective date of
such Assignment Agreement, that (i) it is an Eligible Assignee; (ii) it has
experience and expertise in the making or purchasing of loans such as the Loans;
and (iii) it will make or purchase, as the case may be, its Loans for its own
account in the ordinary course of its business and without a view to
distribution of such Loans within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it being understood that, subject
to the provisions of

this Section 10.6, the disposition of such Loans or any interests therein shall
at all times remain within its exclusive control).

         (f)      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 10.6, as
of the effective date specified in such Assignment Agreement: (i) the assignee
thereunder shall have the rights and obligations of a "Lender" hereunder to the
extent such rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment Agreement and shall thereafter be a party hereto and a
"Lender" for all purposes hereof; (ii) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to
the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned thereby
pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any
rights which survive the termination hereof under Section 10.8) and be released
from its obligations hereunder (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement
covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and
obligations hereunder, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; provided,
anything contained in any of the Credit Documents to the contrary
notwithstanding, Issuing Bank shall continue to have all rights and obligations
as Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it until the
cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of
any amounts drawn thereunder); (iii) the Commitments shall be modified to
reflect the Commitment of such assignee and any remaining Commitment of such
assigning Lender; and (iv) if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of
the Notes hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such
assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its applicable
Notes to Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon new Notes shall be
issued to the assignee and/or to the assigning Lender, with appropriate
insertions, to reflect the new Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of the
assignee and/or the assigning Lender.

         (g)      In addition to the assignments and participations permitted
under the provisions of this Section 10.6, any Lender may assign and pledge all
or any portion of its Loans, the other Obligations owed to such Lender, and its
Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation
A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any operating
circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank, and any Lender which is an
investment fund may pledge all or any portion of its Notes or Loans to its
trustee (unless such trustee is Highland Capital Management, L.P. or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries) in support of its obligations to such trustee or to
its indenture trustee in support of its obligations to noteholders on whose
behalf such indenture trustee is acting; provided, (i) no Lender shall, as
between Company and such Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder
as a result of any such assignment and pledge and (ii) in no event shall such
Federal Reserve Bank or trustee be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to
require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

         (h)      Each Lender shall have the right at any time to sell one or
more participations to any Person (other than Highland Capital Management, L.P.
or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) in, all or any part of its
Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit or participations therein or any other
interest herein or in any other Obligation. The holder of any participation,
other than an Affiliate of the Lender granting such

participation, shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to
take any action hereunder except action directly affecting (i) the extension of
the regularly scheduled maturity of any portion of the principal amount of or
interest on any Loan or fees allocated to such participation or (ii) a reduction
of the principal amount of or the rate of interest payable on any Loan or fees
(other than any waiver of any increase in the interest rate applicable to any
Loan pursuant to Section 2.9) allocated to such participation (it being
understood that any change to the definition of Leverage Ratio or in the
component definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction in any interest
rate), and all amounts payable by any Credit Party hereunder (including amounts
payable to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.18(c), Section 2.19 or Section
2.20) shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation.
Each Credit Party and each Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that, solely for
purposes of Sections 2.17 and Section 10.4, (1) any participation will give rise
to a direct obligation of each Credit Party to the participant and (2) the
participant shall be considered to be a "Lender".

         10.7     INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS. All covenants hereunder shall be
given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not
permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant
shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such
action is taken or condition exists.

         10.8     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS. ALL
representations, warranties and agreements made herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Credit Extension.
Notwithstanding anything herein or implied by law to the contrary, the
agreements of each Credit Party set forth in Sections 2.18(c), 2.19, 2.20, 10.2
and 10.3 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in Sections 9.3, 9.6 and 2.17
shall survive the Termination Date.

         10.9     NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay on the
part of Administrative Agent or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right
or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall impair such
power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or
acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right or privilege. The rights, powers and remedies given to
Beneficiaries hereby are cumulative and shall be in addition to and independent
of all rights, powers and remedies existing by virtue of any statute or rule of
law or in any of the other Credit Documents or in any of the Hedge Agreements.
Any forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such right, power or remedy or be
construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the further exercise of
any such right, power or remedy.

         10.10    MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. Neither Administrative Agent
nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of
any Credit Party or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of
the Obligations. To the extent that any Credit Party makes a payment or payments

and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or
any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common
law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation
or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and
remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full
force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such
enforcement or setoff had not occurred, provided that with respect to
calculating interest on any Obligation that is so reinstated, interest shall
accrue from the date that such Obligation is first reinstated and not from the
previous date of payment.

         10.11    SEVERABILITY. In case any provision herein or obligation
hereunder or the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

         10.12    OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; INDEPENDENT NATURE OF LENDERS' RIGHTS.
The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall be
responsible for the obligations or Commitments of any other Lender hereunder.
Nothing contained herein or in any other Credit Document, and no action taken by
Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute Lenders as a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. The
amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and
independent debt, and, subject to Section 9.8(b), each Lender shall be entitled
to protect and enforce its rights arising out hereof and it shall not be
necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any
proceeding for such purpose.

         10.13    HEADINGS. Section headings herein are included herein for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part hereof for any
other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS
OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LOAN

scope of this waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes
that may be filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this
transaction, including contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and
all other common law and statutory claims. Each party hereto acknowledges that
this waiver is a material inducement to enter into a business relationship, that
each has already relied on this waiver in entering into this Agreement, and that
each will continue to rely on this waiver in their related future dealings. Each

Lender's customary procedures for handling confidential information of such
nature and in accordance with prudent lending or investing practices, it being
understood and agreed by Company that in any event a Lender may make disclosures
to Affiliates of such Lender and such Lender's and Affiliates' directors,
officers, employees and agents in connection with the administration of this
Agreement and the preservation, exercise or enforcement of the rights of the
Agents and the Lenders under this Agreement (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such information and instructed to keep such information confidential)
or disclosures reasonably required by any bona fide assignee, transferee or
participant in connection with the contemplated assignment or transfer by such
Lender of any Loans or any participations therein or by any direct or indirect
contractual counterparties (or the professional advisors thereto) in swap
agreements (provided, any such potential assignee, transferee, participant or
swap counterparties and advisors are advised of and agree to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 10.17) or disclosures required or requested by any
governmental agency or representative thereof or by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners or pursuant to legal process; provided, unless
specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to notify Company of any request by any governmental agency
or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with any
routine examination of such Lender by such governmental agency) for disclosure
of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information; and
provided further, in no event shall any Lender be obligated or required to
return any materials furnished by Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein (or in any Credit
Document), each party (and each of their respective employees, representatives
or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitations of any
kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and all materials of any kind
(including opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to any such party
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, any information
relating to the tax treatment or tax structure shall remain subject to the
confidentiality provisions hereof (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply)
to the extent reasonably necessary to enable the parties hereto, their
respective Affiliates, and their and their respective Affiliates' directors
officers, employees and agents to comply with applicable securities laws. For
this purpose, "tax structure" means any facts relevant to understanding the
federal income tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the
Maximum Amount, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be
reduced to the Maximum Amount. For purposes of calculating the actual amount of
interest paid and/or payable hereunder in respect of laws pertaining to usury or
such other laws, all sums paid or agreed to be paid hereunder or under any other
Credit Document for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of
Company evidenced hereby or by any other Credit Document, outstanding from time
to time shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized,
pro-rated, allocated and spread from the date of disbursement of the proceeds of
the Loans until payment in full of all of such indebtedness, so that the actual
rate of interest on account of such indebtedness is uniform through the term
hereof. The terms and provisions of this subsection shall control and supersede
every other provision of all agreements between Holdings, Company, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any endorser of the Notes and the Lenders.

         Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch,
         as administrative agent
         for the Lenders, and the Lenders and
         the Agents referred to below

         Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  We have acted as special counsel to THL Bedding Company, a
         Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), THL-SC Bedding Company, a
         Delaware corporation ("Holdings"), and each of the entities listed on
         Schedule 1 hereto (together with the Borrower and Holdings, the "Credit
         Parties") in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery
         of, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated, by the
         Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Credit
         Agreement"), by and among the Borrower, Holdings and certain other
         entities party thereto, as guarantors, the financial institutions
         listed on the signature pages thereto (the "Lenders"). Goldman Sachs
         Credit Partners L.P., as sole bookrunner, joint lead arranger and as
         co-syndication agent, UBS Securities LLC , as joint lead arranger and
         co-syndication agent, Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as
         administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the
         "Administrative Agent") and as collateral agent for the Lenders (in
         such capacity, the "Collateral Agent"), and the other Agents named
         therein. Capitalized terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used
         (but not otherwise defined) herein are used herein as so defined. This
         opinion is delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(h) of the Credit
         Agreement.

                  In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified
         or otherwise identified to our satisfaction and, unless otherwise
         noted, each dated as of the date hereof) of (a)(i) the Credit
         Agreement, (ii) the Notes, (iii) the Pledge and Security Agreement and

         instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public
         officials and of officers and representatives of the Credit Parties,
         and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as
         we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions
         hereinafter set forth.

                  In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all
         signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity
         of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to
         original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified,
         conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals
         of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to these
         opinions that have not been independently established, we have relied
         upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and
         representatives of the Credit Parties and upon the representations and
         warranties of the Credit Parties contained in the Credit Documents. We
         have also assumed (i) the valid existence and good standing of
         Dreamwell, Ltd. ("Dreamwell") and Simmons Capital Management, LLC
         (together with Dreamwell, the "Nevada Credit Parties") under the laws
         of the State of Nevada, (ii) that each of the Nevada Credit Parties has
         the requisite corporate or limited liability company, as the case may
         be, power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
         carry on its business as now being conducted, (iii) that each of the
         Nevada Credit Parties has the requisite corporate or limited liability
         company, as the case may be, power and authority to execute and deliver
         the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and (iv) the due
         authorization, execution and delivery by each of the Nevada Credit
         Parties of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. As used
         herein, "to our knowledge" and "of which we are aware" mean the
         conscious awareness of facts or other information by any lawyer in our
         firm actively involved in the transactions contemplated by the Credit
         Agreement.

                  Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications
         stated herein, we are of the opinion that:

                  1. Each Credit Party (other than the Nevada Credit Parties)
         (collectively, the "Delaware Credit Parties") is a corporation or a
         limited liability company, as the case may be, validly existing and in
         good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the
         Delaware Credit Parties has all requisite corporate or limited
         liability company, as the case may be, power and authority to own,
         lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
         being conducted.

                  2. Each of the Delaware Credit Parties has all requisite
         corporate or limited liability company, as the case may be, power and
         authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it
         is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution,
         delivery and performance by the Delaware Credit Parties of the
         Transaction Documents to which each is a party have been duly
         authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company, as
         the case may be, action on the part of the Delaware Credit Parties. The
         Transaction Documents to which each Delaware Credit Party is a party
         have been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Delaware
         Credit Party. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
         thereof by the parties thereto, other than the Delaware Credit Parties,
         each Credit Document to which the Credit Parties are a party
         constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Credit
         Party party thereto, enforceable against it in accordance with its
         terms, subject to

         applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
         reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights
         and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general
         principles of equity, including principles of commercial
         reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether
         enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity) and except
         that (A) rights to indemnification and contribution thereunder may be
         limited by federal or state securities laws or public policy relating
         thereto, (B) no opinion is expressed with respect to any right of
         set-off granted to a Lender pursuant to Section 10.4 of the Credit
         Agreement and to any participant under the Credit Documents and (C)
         certain remedial provisions of the Credit Documents are or may be
         unenforceable in whole or in part under the laws of the State of New
         York, but the inclusion of such provisions does not affect the validity
         of such Credit Documents, and the Credit Documents contain adequate
         provisions for the practical realization of the rights and benefits
         afforded thereby. No opinion is expressed in this paragraph as to the
         attachment, perfection or priority of any liens granted pursuant to the
         Pledge and Security Agreement.

                  3. The execution and delivery by each Delaware Credit Party of
         the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the performance by
         such Delaware Credit Party of its obligations thereunder will not
         conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the
         terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or
         Certificate of Formation, as the case may be, or by-laws or operating
         agreement, as the case may be, of any Delaware Credit Party, (ii) any
         of the terms, conditions or provisions of any document, agreement or
         other instrument set forth on Schedule 2 hereto to which any Delaware
         Credit Party is a party or by which it is bound, (iii) any New York,
         Delaware corporate or limited liability company or federal law or
         regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws,
         as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph), or (iv) any
         judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or
         governmental authority binding on the Delaware Credit Parties of which
         we are aware.

                  4. No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or
         other action by or filing with any New York, Delaware corporate or
         limited liability company or federal governmental authority is required
         in connection with the execution and delivery by each Credit Party of
         the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, the consummation by
         such Credit Party of the transactions contemplated thereby or the
         performance by each Credit Party of its obligations thereunder, except
         for (i) filings in connection with perfecting security interests, (ii)
         consents or filings which have already been made or obtained, (iii)
         those which the failure to make or obtain would not reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (iv) federal and state
         securities or blue sky laws, in each case, as to which we express no
         opinion in this paragraph.

                  5. To our knowledge, there is no litigation, proceeding or
         governmental investigation pending or overtly threatened against the
         Credit Parties that relates to any of the transactions contemplated by
         the Transaction Documents.

                  6. (a) Under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the
         State of New York (the "NY UCC"), the execution and delivery of the
         Pledge and Security Agreement creates a valid security interest in each
         Credit Party's rights in the Collateral (as defined in the Pledge and
         Security Agreement), as security for the Secured Obligations (as
         defined in the Pledge and Security Agreement) of such Credit Party in
         favor of the Collateral Agent. Pursuant to the Pledge and Security
         Agreement, each Delaware Credit Party has authorized for purposes of
         Section 9-509 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of
         Delaware (the "DE UCC" and together with the NY UCC, the "UCC") the
         filing of the Financing Statements naming such Delaware Credit Party as
         debtor. Upon the filing of the Financing Statements with the Secretary
         of State of the State of Delaware, such security interest of the
         Collateral Agent in the Delaware Credit Parties' interest in the
         Collateral is perfected, to the extent a security interest in such
         Collateral may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement
         under the DE UCC.

                           (b) Upon delivery in the State of New York to the
         Collateral Agent of all certificates that represent the Pledged Stock
         (as defined in the Pledge and Security Agreement) identified on
         Schedule 4.4(A) of the Pledge and Security Agreement (the "Pledged
         Certificated Stock"), together with stock powers properly executed in
         blank with respect thereto, and assuming that the Collateral Agent was
         without notice of any adverse claim (as such phrase is defined in
         Section 8-105 of the NY UCC) with respect to the Pledged Certificated
         Stock, such security interest of the Collateral Agent in such Pledged
         Certificated Stock (and the shares represented thereby) will be
         perfected and will be free of any adverse claim.

                  The opinions in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 6 and, with
         respect to subclauses A and B below, subparagraph (b) of this paragraph
         6 are subject to the following exceptions:

                           A. that with respect to rights in the Collateral or
         any Pledged Stock of any Credit Party, we express no opinion, and have
         assumed that (1) such Credit Party has rights in the Collateral and
         such Pledged Stock and (2) value has been give to the Credit Parties;

                           B. that with respect to any Collateral or Pledged
         Stock as to which the perfection of a lien or security interest is
         governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
         Delaware or the State of New York, respectively, we express no opinion;
         and

         December 19, 2003
         Page 5

                           C. that with respect to any Collateral which is or
         may become fixtures (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(41) of the UCC) or
         a commercial tort claim (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(13) of the
         UCC), we express no opinion.

                  The opinion set forth in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph 6
         is also subject to the following exceptions:

                           D. that with respect to (i) federal tax liens
         accorded priority under law and (ii) liens created under Title IV of
         the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 which are properly
         filed after the date hereof, we express no opinion as to the relative
         priority of such liens and the security interests created by the Pledge
         and Security Agreement or as to whether such liens may be adverse
         claims; and

                           E. that with respect to any claim (including for
         taxes) in favor of any state or any of its respective agencies,
         authorities, municipalities or political subdivisions which claim is
         given lien status and/or priority under any law of such state, we
         express no opinion as to the relative priority of such liens and the
         security interests created by the Pledge and Security Agreement or as
         to whether such liens may be adverse claims.

                  In addition, the opinions in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this
         paragraph 6 are subject to (i) the limitations on perfection of

         contained in each of the Credit Documents are true, correct and
         complete in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date to the
         same extent as though made on and as of such date, except to the extent
         such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier
         date, in which case such representations and warranties are true,
         correct and complete in all material respects on and as of such earlier
         date;

                  (ii) as of the Closing Date, no event has occurred and is
         continuing or would result from the consummation of the borrowing
         contemplated hereby that would constitute an Event of Default or a
         Default;

                  (iii) after giving effect to the transactions set forth in

         Senior Unsecured Term Loan Agreement and other Indebtedness permitted
         under Section 6.1 of the Credit Agreement; and

                  (iv) as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the
         Acquisition and the borrowings made on the Closing Date, the pro forma
         Leverage Ratio (which shall include all Cash and Cash Equivalents of
         Company and its Subsidiaries) for the twelve-month period ended October

authorize and direct the issuer of each of such insurance policies to make
payment for all such losses directly to Mortgagee, instead of to Mortgagor and
Mortgagee jointly.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                             [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

                             DEFAULT AND FORECLOSURE

                  SECTION 5.1 REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Mortgagee may, at Mortgagee's election,
exercise any or all of the following rights, remedies and recourses:

                           (a) Acceleration. The Indebtedness shall
automatically become immediately due and payable, if required by the Credit
Agreement and in accordance with the Credit Agreement, or if the Credit
Agreement does not require automatic acceleration, Mortgagee may declare the
Indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, pursuant to and in accordance
with the Credit Agreement, without further notice, presentment, protest, notice
of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, demand or action of any nature
whatsoever (each of which hereby is expressly waived by Mortgagor), whereupon
the same shall become immediately due and payable.

                           (b) Entry on Mortgaged Property. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, enter the Mortgaged Property and take exclusive
possession thereof and of all books, records and accounts relating thereto or
located thereon. If Mortgagor remains in possession of the Mortgaged Property
after an Event of Default and without Mortgagee's prior written consent,
Mortgagee may invoke any legal remedies to dispossess Mortgagor.

<PAGE>

                           (c) Operation of Mortgaged Property. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, hold, lease, develop, manage, operate or otherwise
use the Mortgaged Property upon such terms and conditions as Mortgagee may deem
reasonable under the circumstances (making such repairs, alterations, additions
and improvements and taking other actions, from time to time, as Mortgagee deems
necessary or desirable), and apply all Rents and other amounts collected by
Mortgagee in connection therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
5.7.

                           (d) Foreclosure and Sale. Institute proceedings for
the complete foreclosure of this Mortgage, either by judicial action or by power
of sale, in which case the Mortgaged Property may be sold for cash or credit in
one or more parcels. With respect to any notices required or permitted under the
UCC, Mortgagor agrees that ten (10) days' prior written notice shall be deemed
commercially reasonable. At any such sale by virtue of any judicial proceedings,
power of sale, or any other legal right, remedy or recourse, the title to and
right of possession of any such property shall pass to the purchaser thereof,
and to the fullest extent permitted by law, Mortgagor shall be completely and
irrevocably divested of all of its right, title, interest, claim, equity, equity
of redemption, and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, in and to the
property sold and such sale shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity
against Mortgagor, and against all other Persons claiming or to claim the
property sold or any part thereof by, through or under Mortgagor. Mortgagee or
any of the Lenders may be a purchaser at such sale and if Mortgagee is the
highest bidder, Mortgagee may credit the portion of the purchase price that
would be distributed to Mortgagee against the Indebtedness in lieu of paying
cash. In the event this Mortgage is foreclosed by judicial action, appraisement
of the Mortgaged Property is waived to the extent permitted by applicable law.

                           (e) Receiver. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, make application to a court of competent jurisdiction for, and obtain from
such court as a matter of strict right and without notice to Mortgagor or regard
to the adequacy of the Mortgaged Property for the repayment of the Indebtedness,
the appointment of a receiver of the Mortgaged Property, and Mortgagor
irrevocably consents to such appointment. Any such receiver shall have all the
usual powers and duties of receivers in similar cases, including the full power
to rent, maintain and otherwise operate the Mortgaged Property upon such terms
as may be approved by the court, and shall apply such Rents in accordance with
the provisions of Section 5.7.

                           (f) Other. Exercise all other rights, remedies and
recourses granted under the Credit Documents against Mortgagor.

                  SECTION 5.2 SEPARATE SALES. The Mortgaged Property may be sold
in one or more parcels and in such manner and order as Mortgagee in its sole
discretion may elect; the right of sale arising out of any Event of Default
shall not be exhausted by any one or more sales.

                  SECTION 5.3 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE, CONCURRENT AND NONEXCLUSIVE.
Mortgagee and the Lenders shall have all rights, remedies and recourses against
the Mortgaged Property granted in the Credit Documents and available at law or

                                       5
<PAGE>

equity (including the UCC), which rights (a) shall be cumulated and concurrent,
(b) may be pursued separately, successively or concurrently against Mortgagor,
or against the Mortgaged Property, at the sole discretion of Mortgagee or the
Lenders, (c) may be exercised as often as occasion therefor shall arise, and the
exercise or failure to exercise any of them shall not be construed as a waiver
or release thereof or of any other right, remedy or recourse, and (d) are
intended to be, and shall be, nonexclusive. No action by Mortgagee or the
Lenders in the enforcement of any, rights, remedies or recourses under the
Credit Documents or otherwise at law or equity shall be deemed to cure any Event
of Default.

                  SECTION 5.4 RELEASE OF AND RESORT TO COLLATERAL. Mortgagee may
release, regardless of consideration and without the necessity for any notice to
or consent by the holder of any subordinate lien on the Mortgaged Property, any
part of the Mortgaged Property without, as to the remainder, in any way
impairing, affecting, subordinating or releasing the lien or security interest
created in or evidenced by the Credit Documents or their status as a first and
prior lien and security interest in and to the Mortgaged Property. For payment
of the Indebtedness, Mortgagee may resort to any other security in such order
and manner as Mortgagee may elect.

                  SECTION 5.5 WAIVER OF REDEMPTION, NOTICE AND MARSHALLING OF
ASSETS. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Mortgagor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and releases (a) all benefit that might accrue to
Mortgagor by virtue of any present or future law or judicial decision exempting
the Mortgaged Property from attachment, levy or sale on execution or providing
for any stay of execution, exemption from civil process, redemption or extension
of time for payment, (b) except as provided in the Credit Agreement, all notices
of any Event of Default or of Mortgagee's election to exercise or the actual
exercise of any right, remedy or recourse provided for under the Credit
Documents, and (c) any right to a marshalling of assets or a sale in inverse
order of alienation.

                  SECTION 5.6 DISCONTINUANCE OF PROCEEDINGS. If Mortgagee or the
Lenders shall have proceeded to invoke any right, remedy or recourse permitted
under the Credit Documents and shall thereafter elect to discontinue or abandon
it for any reason, Mortgagee or the Lenders shall have the unqualified right to
do so, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and, in such an event, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, Mortgagor and Mortgagee or the Lenders shall
be restored to their former positions with respect to the Indebtedness, the
Obligations, this Mortgage, the Mortgaged Property and otherwise, and the
rights, remedies, recourses and powers of Mortgagee or the Lenders hereunder
shall continue as if the right, remedy or recourse had never been invoked, but
no such discontinuance or abandonment shall waive any Event of Default which may
then exist or the right of Mortgagee or the Lenders thereafter to exercise any
right, remedy or recourse under this Mortgage for such Event of Default.

                           (a) Application of Proceeds. After the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, subject to the terms of the
Credit Agreement, the proceeds of any sale of, and the Rents and other amounts
generated by the holding, leasing, management, operation or other use of the
Mortgaged Property, shall be applied

                                       6
<PAGE>

by Mortgagee (or the receiver, if one is appointed) in the order provided
therefor in the Credit Agreement unless otherwise required by applicable law:

                  SECTION 5.7 OCCUPANCY AFTER FORECLOSURE. Any sale of the
Mortgaged Property or any part thereof in accordance with Section 5.1(d) will
divest all right, title and interest of Mortgagor in and to the property sold.
Subject to applicable law, any purchaser at a foreclosure sale will receive
immediate possession of the property purchased. If Mortgagor retains possession
of such property or any part thereof subsequent to such sale, Mortgagor will be
considered a tenant at sufferance of the purchaser, and will, if Mortgagor
remains in possession after demand to remove, be subject to eviction and
removal, forcible or otherwise, with or without process of law.

                  SECTION 5.8 ADDITIONAL ADVANCES AND DISBURSEMENTS; COSTS OF
ENFORCEMENT.

                           (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Event of Default, if allowed under the Credit Agreement, Mortgagee and each
of the Lenders shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure such Event
of Default pertaining to the Mortgaged Property in the name and on behalf of
Mortgagor. All reasonable sums advanced and expenses incurred at any time by
Mortgagee or any Lender under this Section 5.9, or otherwise under this Mortgage
shall bear interest from the date that such sum is advanced or expense incurred,
to and including the date of reimbursement, computed at the rate or rates at
which interest is then computed on the Indebtedness, and all such sums, together
with interest thereon, shall be secured by this Mortgage.

                           (b) Mortgagor shall pay all reasonable expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) of or incidental to the
perfection and enforcement of this Mortgage, or the enforcement, compromise or
settlement of the Indebtedness under this Mortgage and for the curing thereof,
or for defending or asserting the rights and claims of Mortgagee or the Lenders
in respect of this Mortgage by litigation or otherwise.

                  SECTION 5.9 NO MORTGAGEE IN POSSESSION. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, neither the enforcement of any of the remedies
under this Article 5, the assignment of the Rents and Leases under Article 6,
the security interests under Article 7, nor any other remedies afforded to
Mortgagee or the Lenders under the Credit Documents, at law or in equity shall
cause Mortgagee or any Lender to be deemed or construed to be a mortgagee in
possession of the Mortgaged Property, to obligate Mortgagee or any Lender to
lease the Mortgaged Property or attempt to do so, or to take any action, incur
any expense, or perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability
whatsoever under any of the Leases or otherwise.

                                    ARTICLE V1
                         ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 6.1 ASSIGNMENT. In furtherance of and in addition to
the assignment made by Mortgagor in Section 2.1 of this Mortgage, Mortgagor
hereby absolutely and unconditionally assigns, sells, transfers and conveys to
Mortgagee all of its right, title and interest in and to all Leases, whether now
existing or hereafter entered into, and all of its right, title and interest in
and to all Rents. This assignment is an absolute assignment and not an
assignment for additional security only. So long as no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing. Mortgagor shall have a revocable license from
Mortgagee to exercise all rights extended to the landlord under the Leases,
including the right to receive and collect all Rents and to hold the Rents in
trust for use in the payment and performance of the Obligations and to otherwise
use the same. The foregoing license is granted subject to the conditional
limitation that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, whether or not
legal proceedings have commenced, and without regard to waste, adequacy of
security for the Obligations or solvency of Mortgagor, the license herein
granted shall automatically expire and terminate, without notice by Mortgagee
(any such notice being hereby expressly waived by Mortgagor).

                  SECTION 6.2 PERFECTION UPON RECORDATION. Mortgagor
acknowledges that Mortgagee has taken all actions necessary to obtain, and that
upon recordation of this Mortgage Mortgagee shall have, to the extent permitted
under applicable law, a valid and fully perfected, first priority, present
assignment of the Rents arising out of the Leases and all security for such
Leases. Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that upon recordation of this
Mortgage. Mortgagee's interest in the Rents shall be deemed to be fully
perfected, "choate" and enforced as to Mortgagor and all third parties,
including, without limitation, any subsequently appointed trustee in any case
under Title 11 of the United States Code (the "BANKRUPTCY CODE"), without the
necessity of commencing a foreclosure action with respect to this Mortgage,
making formal demand for the Rents, obtaining the appointment of a receiver or
taking any other affirmative action.

                  SECTION 6.3 BANKRUPTCY PROVISIONS. Without limitation of the
absolute nature of the assignment of the Rents hereunder, Mortgagor and
Mortgagee agree that (a) this Mortgage shall constitute a "security agreement"
for purposes of Section 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) the security interest
created by this Mortgage extends to property of Mortgagor acquired before the
commencement of a case in bankruptcy and to all amounts paid as Rents and (c)
such security interest shall extend to all Rents acquired by the estate after
the commencement of any case in bankruptcy.

                  SECTION 6.4 NO MERGER OF ESTATES. So long as part of the
Indebtedness and the Obligations secured hereby remain unpaid and undischarged,
the fee and leasehold estates to the Mortgaged Property shall not merge, but
shall remain separate and distinct, notwithstanding the union of such estates
either in Mortgagor, Mortgagee, any tenant or any third party by purchase or
otherwise.

                  SECTION 7.1 SECURITY INTEREST. This Mortgage constitutes a
"security agreement" on personal property within the meaning of the UCC and
other applicable law and with respect to the Fixtures, Leases, Rents, Tax
Refunds, Proceeds, and Condemnation Awards. To this end. Mortgagor grants to
Mortgagee a first and prior security interest in the Fixtures, Leases, Rents,
Tax Refunds, Proceeds, Condemnation Awards and all other Mortgaged Property
which is personal property to secure the payment of the Indebtedness and
performance of the Obligations, and agrees that Mortgagee shall have all the
rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC with respect to all such
personal property. Any notice of sale, disposition or other intended action by
Mortgagee with respect to the Fixtures, Leases, Rents, Tax Refunds, Proceeds,
and Condemnation Awards sent to Mortgagor at least ten (10) days prior to any
action under the UCC shall constitute reasonable notice to Mortgagor.

                  SECTION 7.2 FINANCING STATEMENTS; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE.
Mortgagor shall execute and deliver to Mortgagee, in form and substance
satisfactory to Mortgagee, such financing statements and such further assurances
as Mortgagee may, from time to time, reasonably consider necessary to create,
perfect and preserve Mortgagee's security interest hereunder and Mortgagee may
cause such statements and assurances to be recorded and filed, at such times and
places as may be required or permitted by law to so create, perfect and preserve
such security interest. Mortgagor's chief executive office is in the State of
Georgia at the address set forth in the first paragraph of this Mortgage.

                  SECTION 7.3 FIXTURE FILING. This Mortgage shall also
constitute a "fixture filing" for the purposes of the UCC against all of the
Mortgaged Property which is or is to become fixtures. The address of Mortgagor
(the debtor) and the address of Mortgagee (the secured party) appear in Exhibit
B attached to this Mortgage.

                  SECTION 9.1 NOTICES. Any notice required or permitted to be
given under this Mortgage shall be given in accordance with Section 10.1 of the
Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.2 COVENANTS RUNNING WITH THE LAND. All Obligations
contained in this Mortgage are intended by Mortgagor and Mortgagee to be, and
shall be construed as, covenants running with the Mortgaged Property. As used
herein, "Mortgagor" shall refer to the party named in the first paragraph of
this Mortgage and to any subsequent owner of all or any portion of the Mortgaged
Property. All Persons who may have or acquire an interest in the Mortgaged
Property shall be deemed to have notice of, and be bound by, the terms of the
Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents to the extent but only to the
extent they bind Mortgagor; however, no such party shall be entitled to any
rights thereunder without the prior written consent of Mortgagee.

in (including, without limitation, a change in interpretation of) any applicable
law (i) deducting or allowing Mortgagor to deduct from the value of the
Mortgaged Property for the purpose of taxation any lien or security interest
thereon or (ii) subjecting Mortgagee or any of the Lenders to any tax or
changing the basis of taxation of mortgages, deeds of trust, or other liens or
debts secured thereby, or the manner of collection of such taxes, in each such
case, so as to affect this Mortgage, the Indebtedness or Mortgagee, and the
result is to increase the taxes imposed upon or the cost to Mortgagee of
maintaining the Indebtedness, or to reduce the amount of any payments receivable
hereunder, then, and in any such event, Mortgagor shall, on demand, pay to
Mortgagee and the Lenders additional amounts to compensate for such increased
costs or reduced amounts, provided that if any such payment or reimbursement
shall be unlawful, or taxable to Mortgagee, or would constitute usury or render
the Indebtedness wholly or partially usurious under applicable law, then
Mortgagor shall pay or reimburse Mortgagee or the Lenders for payment of the
lawful and non-usurious portion thereof.

                  SECTION 9.4 MORTGAGE TAX. Mortgagor shall (i) pay when due any
tax imposed upon it or upon Mortgagee or any Lender pursuant to the tax law of
the state in which the Mortgaged Property is located in connection with the
execution, delivery and recordation of this Mortgage and any of the other Credit
Documents, and (ii) prepare, execute and file any form required to be prepared,
executed and filed in connection therewith.

                  SECTION 9.5 ATTORNEY IN FACT. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably
appoints Mortgagee and its successors and assigns, as its attorney-in-fact with
full power of substitution, which agency is coupled with an interest, (a) to
execute and/or record any notices of completion, cessation of labor or any other
notices that Mortgagee deems appropriate to protect Mortgagee's interest, if
Mortgagor shall fail to do so within thirty (30) days after written request by
Mortgagee, (b) upon the issuance of a deed pursuant to the foreclosure of this
Mortgage or the delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, to execute all
instruments of assignment, conveyance or further assurance with respect to the
Fixtures, Leases, Rents, Tax Refunds, Proceeds, and Condemnation Awards in favor
of the grantee of any such deed and as may be necessary or desirable for such
purpose, (c) to prepare, execute and file or record financing statements,
continuation statements, applications for registration and like papers necessary
to create, perfect or preserve Mortgagee's security interests and rights in or
to any of the Mortgaged Property, and (d) upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, to perform any obligation of Mortgagor
hereunder, however: (1) Mortgagee shall not under any circumstances be obligated
to perform any obligation of Mortgagor; (2) any sums advanced by Mortgagee in
such performance shall be added to and included in the Indebtedness and shall
bear interest at the rate or rates at which interest is then computed on the
Indebtedness; (3) Mortgagee as such attorney-in-fact shall only be accountable
for such funds as are actually received by Mortgagee: and (4) Mortgagee shall
not be liable to Mortgagor or any other person or entity for any failure to take
any action which it is empowered to take under this Section 9.5.

                  SECTION 9.6 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Mortgage shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Mortgagee and Mortgagor and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise permitted by the Credit
Agreement, Mortgagor shall not, without the prior written consent of Mortgagee,
assign any rights, duties or obligations hereunder.

                  SECTION 9.7 NO WAIVER. Any failure by Mortgagee or the Lenders
to insist upon strict performance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions
of this Mortgage shall not be deemed to be a waiver of same, and Mortgagee and
the Lenders shall have the right at any time to insist upon strict performance
of all of such terms, provisions and conditions.

                  SECTION 9.8 CREDIT AGREEMENT. If any conflict or inconsistency
exists between this Mortgage and the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement
shall govern.

                  SECTION 9.9 RELEASE OR RECONVEYANCE. Upon payment in full of
the Indebtedness and performance in full of the Obligations, Mortgagee, at
Mortgagor's expense, shall release the liens and security interests created by
this Mortgage or reconvey the Mortgaged Property to Mortgagor.

                  SECTION 9.10 WAIVER OF STAY, MORATORIUM AND SIMILAR RIGHTS.
Mortgagor agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully do so, that it will
not at any time insist upon or plead or in any way take advantage of any stay,
marshalling of assets, extension, redemption or moratorium law now or hereafter
in force and effect so as to prevent or hinder the enforcement of the provisions
of this Mortgage or the Indebtedness secured hereby, or any rights or remedies
of Mortgagee hereunder.

                  SECTION 9.11 APPLICABLE LAW. The provisions of this Mortgage
regarding the creation, perfection and enforcement of the liens and security
interests herein granted shall be governed by and construed under the laws of
the state in which the Mortgaged Property is located. All other provisions of
this Mortgage shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York (including,
without limitation, Section 5 1401 of the General Obligations Law of the State
of New York), without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

                  SECTION 9.12 HEADINGS. The Article, Section and Subsection
titles hereof are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way
alter, modify or define, or be used in construing, the text of such Articles,
Sections or Subsections.

                  SECTION 9.13 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Mortgage and the other
Credit Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding between Mortgagee
and Mortgagor and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between such
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Accordingly, the
Credit Documents may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous
or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral
agreements between the parties.

                  SECTION 9.14 REDUCTION OF SECURED AMOUNT. In the event that
the amount secured by the Mortgage is less than the aggregate Indebtedness
evidenced by the Mortgage Notes, then the amount secured shall be reduced only
by the last and final sums that Mortgagor or Borrower repays with respect to the
Indebtedness and shall not be reduced by any intervening repayments of the
Indebtedness. So long as the balance of the Indebtedness exceeds the amount
secured, any payments of the Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be applied
against, or to reduce, the portion of the Indebtedness secured by this Mortgage.
Such payments shall instead be deemed to reduce only such portions of the
Indebtedness as are secured by other collateral located outside of the state in
which the Mortgaged Property is located or as are unsecured.

the provisions of Sections 846.101 and 846.103, Wisconsin Statutes, as the same
may be amended or renumbered from time to time, providing for a reduced period
of redemption between foreclosure judgment and sale upon Mortgagee's waiving the
right to any judgment for deficiency, and consenting to Mortgagor's remaining in
possession of the Mortgaged Property and collecting all Rents therefrom, up to
the court's confirmation of the foreclosure sale.

                  SECTION 10.3 TERMINATION OF LICENSE TO COLLECT RENTS. In
