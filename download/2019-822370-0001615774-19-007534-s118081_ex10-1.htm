the assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) who is not a member of the Parent Group or the Telemynd Group
of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action (collectively, a &ldquo;<B><I>Third-Party Claim</I></B>&rdquo;)
with respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnitee pursuant to <U>Section
4.02</U> or <U>Section 4.03</U>, or any other Section of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, such Indemnitee shall give
such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof as soon as practicable, but in any event within fourteen (14) days (or sooner if
the nature of the Third-Party Claim so requires) after becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim. Any such notice shall describe
the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, including the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim for indemnification,
and include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third-Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of an Indemnitee to provide notice in accordance with this <U>Section 4.05(a)</U>
shall not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent to which
the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by the Indemnitee&rsquo;s failure to provide notice in accordance with this <U>Section

</FONT><U>Control of Defense</U>. An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend (and seek to settle or compromise), at its own expense
and with its own counsel, any Third-Party Claim; provided that, prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming and controlling defense
of such Third-Party Claim, it shall first confirm to the Indemnitee in writing that, assuming the facts presented to the Indemnifying
Party by the Indemnitee being true, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Indemnitee for any such damages to the extent resulting
from, or arising out of, such Third-Party-Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense
and, in the course of defending such Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party discovers that the facts presented at the time
the Indemnifying Party acknowledged its indemnification obligation in respect of such Third-Party Claim were not true in all material
respects and (ii) such untruth provides a reasonable basis for asserting that the Indemnifying Party does not have an indemnification
obligation in respect of such Third-Party Claim, then (A) the Indemnifying Party shall not be bound by such acknowledgment, (B)
the Indemnifying Party shall promptly thereafter provide the Indemnitee written notice of its assertion that it does not have an
indemnification obligation in respect of such Third-Party Claim and (C) the Indemnitee shall have the right to assume the defense
of such Third-Party Claim. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with <U>Section
4.05(a)</U> (or sooner, if the nature of the Third-Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall provide written notice
to the Indemnitee indicating whether the Indemnifying Party shall assume responsibility for defending the Third-Party Claim and
specifying any reservations or exceptions to its defense. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending
any Third-Party Claim or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from
an Indemnitee as provided in <U>Section 4.05(a)</U>, then the Indemnitee that is the subject of such Third-Party Claim shall be
entitled to continue to conduct and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim.</P>

the Indemnifying Party to reject or otherwise abandon its assumption of such defense. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
responsibility for defending any Third-Party Claim or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election within thirty (30) days after

have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel as necessary) of its own choosing to monitor and participate
in (but not control) the defense of any Third-Party Claim for which it is a potential Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, and the
provisions of <U>Section 4.05(c)</U> shall not apply to such fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to <U>Sections
6.07</U> and <U>6.08</U>, such Party shall cooperate with the Party entitled to conduct and control the defense of such Third-Party
Claim in such defense and make available to the controlling Party, at the non-controlling Party&rsquo;s expense, all witnesses,
information and materials in such Party&rsquo;s possession or under such Party&rsquo;s control relating thereto as are reasonably
required by the controlling Party. In addition to the foregoing, if any Indemnitee shall in good faith determine that such Indemnitee
and the Indemnifying Party have actual or potential differing defenses or conflicts of interest between them that make joint representation
inappropriate, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel as necessary) and to
participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, and in such case the Indemnifying Party shall
bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for all Indemnitees.</P>

be indemnified hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
unless such settlement or compromise is solely for monetary damages that are fully payable by the settling or compromising Party,
does not involve any admission, finding or determination of wrongdoing or violation of Law by the other Party and provides for
a full, unconditional and irrevocable release of the other Party from all Liability in connection with the Third-Party Claim. The
Parties hereby agree that if a Party presents the other Party with a written notice containing a proposal to settle or compromise
a Third-Party Claim for which either Party is seeking to be indemnified hereunder and the Party receiving such proposal does not
respond in any manner to the Party presenting such proposal within thirty (30) days (or within any such shorter time period that

shall cooperate with Telemynd in making the Section 336(e) Election, including filing any statements, amending any Tax Returns
or taking such other action reasonably necessary to carry out the Section 336(e) Election; provided that Parent shall not be required
to take any action requested by Telemynd in furtherance of this <U>Section 8.09(b)</U> that Parent reasonably and in good faith
determines to be materially adverse to Parent or any other member of the Parent Group. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement
is intended to constitute a written, binding agreement by Parent and Telemynd to make such Section 336(e) Election within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.336-2(h)(1)(i) if Telemynd determines that such election shall be made. In such event, within
sixty (60) days after the Distribution Date, Telemynd shall provide Parent with a proposed determination of the &ldquo;aggregate
deemed asset disposition price&rdquo; and the &ldquo;adjusted grossed-up basis&rdquo; (each as defined under applicable Treasury
Regulations) and the allocation of such &ldquo;aggregate deemed asset disposition price&rdquo; and &ldquo;adjusted grossed-up basis&rdquo;
among the Telemynd Assets, each in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 336(e) of the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations (the &ldquo;<B><I>Section 336(e) Allocation Statement</I></B>&rdquo;). Within thirty (30) days after Parent&rsquo;s
receipt of the Section 336(e) Allocation Statement, Parent shall provide comments (if any) to Telemynd to the Section 336(e) Allocation
Statement and Telemynd shall consider such comments in good faith; provided, however, that Telemynd may not reject any such Parent
comment if such rejection would materially adversely affect Parent without Parent&rsquo;s consent, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned (taking into account the rights and obligations under this Agreement); provided, however, that
if Telemynd may not reject any such comment pursuant to this sentence then the Parties shall work together in good faith and any
remaining disagreement with respect to such comment shall be resolved pursuant to <U>Section 8.04</U>. If Telemynd determines that
the Section 336(e) Election shall be made, no member of the Parent Group or the Telemynd Group shall take any position inconsistent
with the Section 336(e) Election including the Section 336(e) Allocation Statement (as finally resolved pursuant to this <U>Section
8.09(b)</U>) except as may be required by a &ldquo;determination&rdquo; as defined in Section 1313 of the Code. For the avoidance
of doubt, Telemynd shall bear all costs, expenses and Liabilities of Parent arising solely as a result of this <U>Section 8.09(b)</U>,
including out of pocket costs and expenses arising in connection with amending any Parent Tax Returns.</P>

(the &ldquo;<B><I>Accounting Firm</I></B>&rdquo;) to resolve such dispute. In this regard, the Accounting Firm shall make determinations
with respect to the disputed items based solely on representations made by Parent and Telemynd and their respective representatives,
and not by independent review, and shall function only as an expert and not as an arbitrator and shall be required to make a determination
within the ranges submitted by the Parties. The Parties shall require the Accounting Firm to resolve all disputes no later than
thirty (30) days after the submission of such dispute to the Accounting Firm, and agree that all decisions by the Accounting Firm
with respect thereto shall be final and conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Accounting Firm shall resolve all disputes in
a manner consistent with this Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in a manner consistent with the
Past Practices of Parent and its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Parties shall require the Accounting
Firm to render all determinations in writing and to set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such determination. The total
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated and borne between Parent and Telemynd based upon that percentage of
such fees and expenses equal to the percentage of the dollar value of the proposed determinations submitted to the Accounting Firm
determined in favor of the other Party; provided, that if in light of the nature of the dispute the foregoing is not feasible,
such costs and expenses shall be borne equally by the Parties. Any initial retainer required by the Accounting Firm shall be funded
equally by the Parties (and, following the Accounting Firm&rsquo;s determination, the Parties shall make appropriate payments between
themselves as are necessary to give effect to the preceding sentence). To the extent the provisions of this <U>Section 8.16</U>

to the contrary contained herein, in the case of Parent Consolidated Returns, the Accounting Firm shall resolve any dispute in
favor of Telemynd if Telemynd&rsquo;s position is supported by a &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; standard under the Code or
if no position is supported by a &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; standard, if Telemynd&rsquo;s position has &ldquo;substantial
