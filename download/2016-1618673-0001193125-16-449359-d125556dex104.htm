warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, they shall be true and correct in all respects as of such earlier date. In furtherance of the foregoing, the New Subsidiary, as security for the payment and performance in full of the Secured
Obligations does hereby create and grant to the Collateral Agent, its successors and assigns, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, their successors and assigns, a security interest in and lien on all of the New Subsidiary&#146;s right, title and
interest in and to the Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement) of the New Subsidiary. Each reference to a &#147;Grantor&#148; in the Security Agreement shall be deemed to include the New Subsidiary. The Security Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by reference. </P>

each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Supplement shall become effective when the Collateral Agent shall have received a counterpart of this Supplement that bears the
signature of the New Subsidiary and the Collateral Agent has executed a counterpart hereof. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Supplement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of
this Supplement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;4. The New Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants that (a)&nbsp;set forth on <U>Schedule

unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and in the Security Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. </P>
