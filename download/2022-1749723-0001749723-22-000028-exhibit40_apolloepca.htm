At any time  during the sixty (60) day period following Sellers&#8217; receipt of the Post-Closing Statement  or the date the Pre-Closing Statement is deemed to constitute the Post-Closing Statement  as provided above (the &#8220;Review Period&#8221;), Sellers may deliver to Purchaser one or more  written reports or supplements thereto setting forth in reasonable detail any changes that  Sellers propose be made to the Post-Closing Statement together with any supporting  calculations therefor (such written report, an &#8220;Objection Notice&#8221;).  Sellers shall be deemed  to have irrevocably waived any right to object to the Post-Closing Statement unless Sellers  deliver a valid Objection Notice to Purchaser within the Review Period and, if the Review  Period expires without Sellers so delivering an Objection Notice, then the Post-Closing  Statement and Total Adjusted Consideration set forth therein shall become final and  binding for all purposes of this Agreement.  (ii) If Sellers deliver an Objection Notice to Purchaser during the  Review Period, then Purchaser and Sellers shall undertake to agree on the items subject to  an Objection Notice (it being understood that all matters not raised in a timely Objection  Notice shall be deemed final and binding for all purposes of this Agreement) and the  resulting final Total Adjusted Consideration no later than thirty (30) days after the date on  which Sellers delivered such Objection Notice to Purchaser.  In the event that Sellers and  Purchaser fail to reach agreement within such thirty (30) day period, Sellers and Purchaser  shall within ten (10) days following the end of such thirty (30) day period mutually engage  and refer the remaining disputed matters to a nationally-recognized independent  accounting firm as is mutually agreed in writing by Sellers and Purchaser or, if Purchaser  and Sellers fail to agree in writing within such time period, then such other nationally- recognized independent accounting firm appointed by an arbitrator selected by the  Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association as requested by Purchaser  or Sellers (such firm that agrees to serve hereunder, the &#8220;Accounting Firm&#8221;).  (iii) Within twenty (20) days following the agreement of the Accounting  Firm to serve hereunder, each of Purchaser and Sellers shall deliver to the other and the  Accounting Firm (A) the Pre-Closing Statement, the Post-Closing Statement, the Objection  Notice and such work papers, invoices and other reports and information relating to the  disputed matters as the Accounting Firm may request from either Purchaser or Sellers and  (B) Purchaser&#8217;s or Sellers&#8217;, as applicable, proposed resolution of the disputed matters  (which proposed resolution shall not seek a greater decrease to the Total Adjusted  Consideration than the decrease proposed by Purchaser in the Post-Closing Statement nor  a greater increase to the Total Adjusted Consideration than the increase proposed by Sellers  in the Objection Notice) and any materials such Person wishes to present to justify the  resolution it so presents (the foregoing items (A) and (B) together forming Purchaser&#8217;s or  Sellers&#8217;, as applicable, &#8220;Submission&#8221;).

(iv) The Accounting Firm shall make a determination of the Total  Adjusted Consideration as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after  receipt of the Submissions and shall (A) base its determination solely on the Submissions  and (B) consider only those items, and the related amounts in Purchaser&#8217;s and Sellers&#8217;  respective calculations, that were raised in a timely Objection Notice or Post-Closing  Statement and are identified as being items and amounts to which Purchaser and Sellers  have been unable to agree. Absent manifest arithmetical error, the Accounting Firm&#8217;s  determination shall be final, conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Sellers, without right  of appeal, and shall constitute an arbitral award upon which a judgment may be entered in  any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Accounting Firm may not award interest,  damages or penalties.  In determining the proper amount of the Total Adjusted  Consideration, the Accounting Firm shall not increase the Total Adjusted Consideration  more than the increase proposed by Sellers in the Objection Notice nor decrease the Total  Adjusted Consideration more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser in the Post-Closing  Statement, as set forth in their respective Submissions, as applicable.  (v) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated  between Sellers and Purchaser based upon the percentage which the portion of the  contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the total amount actually contested  between Sellers or Purchaser in the Submissions, and will be settled solely by Purchaser  and Sellers in a manner consistent with such principles within ten (10) Business Days after  the Accounting Firm has made a determination in accordance with Section 2.02(d)(iv).  For  example, if (A) Purchaser values an item at an amount equal to $1,000, (B) Sellers submit  an Objection Notice contesting only $400 of the amount claimed by Purchaser and (C) the  Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Purchaser $300 of the $400  contested amount, then the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated  seventy-five percent (75%) (i.e., $300/$400) to Sellers and twenty-five percent (25%) (i.e.,  $100/$400) to Purchaser.  Purchaser and Sellers will jointly retain the Accounting Firm  and each pay fifty percent (50%) of any retainer.  During the engagement, the Accounting  Firm will bill fifty percent (50%) of the total charges to Purchaser and fifty percent (50%)  of the total charges to Sellers (with all such costs to be ultimately borne pursuant to the  first sentence of this Section 2.02(d)(v)).  (vi) The date upon which all adjustments and amounts in the Post- Closing Statement are agreed to (or deemed agreed to, including by decision of the  Accounting Firm) by Sellers and Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.02(d) shall be  referred to as the &#8220;Final Settlement Date&#8221; and the final aggregate Total Adjusted  Consideration as determined accordingly shall be referred to as the &#8220;Final Total Adjusted  Consideration.&#8221;  </FONT></DIV>

(c) The provisions of this Section 10.14 are intended to be for the benefit of,  and shall be enforceable by, each Released Party, each of whom is a third party beneficiary of this  Section 10.14 notwithstanding anything to the contrary.    Section 10.15 Waiver of Conflicts and Privileged Information.   (a) Purchaser agrees that, after the Closing, Purchaser will not have any right  to access or control any of the records or communications of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld  LLP (&#8220;Akin Gump&#8221;) relating to or affecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  (including the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and related  agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby), which  will be the property of (and be controlled by) Sellers.  In addition, Purchaser agrees that it would  be impractical to remove all Attorney-Client Communications from the records (including e-mails  and other electronic files) of Sellers or any of their Affiliates.  Accordingly, Purchaser will not,  and will cause each of its Affiliates not to, use any Attorney-Client Communication remaining in  the records of Sellers or any of its Affiliates after the Closing in a manner that would reasonably  be expected to be adverse to Sellers or any of its Affiliates.  (b) Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, that from  and after the Closing (i) the attorney-client privilege, all other evidentiary privileges, and the  expectation of client confidence as to all Attorney-Client Communications belong to Sellers (or  their respective Affiliates) and will not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates  and (ii) Sellers (or their respective Affiliates) will have the exclusive right to control, assert or  waive the attorney-client privilege, any other evidentiary privilege, and the expectation of client  confidence with respect to such Attorney-Client Communications.  Accordingly, Purchaser will  not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Company Group) and  direct each of its other Affiliates not to, (x) assert any attorney-client privilege, other evidentiary  privilege, or expectation of client confidence with respect to any Attorney-Client Communication,  except in the event of a post-Closing dispute with a Person that is not Sellers or any of their  respective Affiliates; or (y) take any action which could cause any Attorney-Client  Communication to cease being a confidential communication or to otherwise lose protection under  the attorney-client privilege or any other evidentiary privilege, including waiving such protection  in any dispute with a person that is not Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates.  Furthermore,  Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its Affiliates, that in the event of a  dispute between Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on  the other hand, arising out of or relating to any matter in which Akin Gump represented both  parties, neither the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence, nor any right to  any other evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure to Sellers or their respective Affiliates  any information or documents developed or shared during the course of Akin Gump&#8217;s  representation of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates.  </FONT></DIV>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Transaction  Document or otherwise, no Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any director, officer,  employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or  other Representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any Contracting Party, or any  director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, equityholder, Affiliate, agent,  attorney, or other Representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing  (collectively, the &#8220;Nonparty Affiliates&#8221;), shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in  law or in equity, or granted by statute or otherwise) for any Losses arising under, out of, in  connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents  or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or  the negotiation, execution, performance, or breach of this Agreement or any Transaction  Document; and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each Contracting Party, on behalf of  itself and all other Persons, hereby waives and releases all such Losses against any such Nonparty  Affiliates.

The provisions of this Section 10.16 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be  enforceable by, each Nonparty Affiliate, each of whom is a third party beneficiary of this Section  10.16 notwithstanding anything to the contrary.

After the Closing, each party agrees to take  such further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as are  reasonably requested by the any other party for carrying out the purposes of this Agreement or any  Transaction Document.   Section 10.18 Default.  If any party fails to pay any amounts owed under this  Agreement to another party when due, interest shall accrue on such amounts from the date such  amounts become owed through the date of payment at the Default Rate; provided, that in no event  will Purchaser be required to pay interest under this Section 10.18 and Section 7.03(b) with respect  to the same default.   </FONT></DIV>
