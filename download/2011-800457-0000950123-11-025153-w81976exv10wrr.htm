<DIV align="Center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>2011 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Purpose</U>. The purpose of this 2011 equity incentive plan for employees (this
&#147;Plan&#148;) is to encourage the employees of Donegal Group Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) and its subsidiaries to
acquire a proprietary interest in the growth and performance of the Company, and to continue to
align the interests of those employees with the interests of the Company&#146;s stockholders to generate
an increased incentive for such person to contribute to the growth, development and financial
success of the Company and the member companies of the Donegal Insurance Group, including companies
from which the Company or Donegal Mutual assumes 100% quota share reinsurance (the &#147;Group&#148;). To
accomplish these purposes, this Plan provides a means whereby employees may receive stock options,
stock awards and other stock-based awards that are based on, or measured by, or payable in shares
of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Administration</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Administrators</U>. The Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) shall
administer this Plan. The Board shall appoint a committee, which initially shall be the
compensation committee to assist in the administration of this Plan. The committee, with the
advice of the Company&#146;s chief executive officer, shall recommend to the Board the employees to whom
the Company should grant awards and the type, size and terms of each grant. The Board has the
authority to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of this
Plan. All decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Board shall be final and binding on
all grantees and all other holders of awards granted under this Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>The Committee</U>. The committee shall be comprised of two or more members of the
Board, each of whom shall be a &#147;non-employee director&#148; within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;16b-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). In addition, each member of the committee
shall be an &#147;outside director&#148; within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). Subject to the foregoing, from time to time, the Board may increase
or decrease the size of the committee, appoint additional members, remove members, with or without
cause, appoint new members, fill vacancies or remove all members of the committee and thereafter
directly administer this Plan. The committee shall have those duties and responsibilities assigned
to it under this Plan, and the Board may assign to the committee the authority to make certain
other determinations and interpretations under this Plan. All decisions, determinations and
interpretations of the committee in such cases shall be final and binding on all grantees and all
other holders of awards granted under this Plan.

limit, shares equal to the maximum number of shares that the Company may issue under the award. If
