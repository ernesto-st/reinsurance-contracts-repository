Upon receipt of such Letter of Credit Request, the Agent shall promptly notify the

Agent, the provisions of the Credit Documents shall inure to its benefit as to any

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
If any Bank (a &#147;<U>Benefitted Bank</U>&#148;) shall at any time receive any payment
or collateral in respect of the Obligations in excess of its pro rata share (based on its
Commitment Percentage) (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to
events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8.1(h) or (i), or otherwise),
such Benefitted Bank shall purchase from each of the other Banks such portion of each
such other Bank&#146;s participation in the Obligations, and shall provide each of such
other Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall
be necessary to cause such Benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of
such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks, provided, however, that if
all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such
Benefitted Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits
returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Applicant and
Co-Applicants agree that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank&#146;s
percentage of Obligations may exercise all rights of payment (including, without
limitation, rights of set-off, to the extent not prohibited by law) with respect to such
portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct holder of such portion.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, upon the occurrence
of and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 8.1(a) or (b), each
Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to the Applicant, any such notice being
expressly waived by each Credit Party to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, to
set-off and apply against any indebtedness, whether contingent, matured or unmatured of
such Credit Party to such Bank, any amount owing from such Bank to such Credit Party, at,
or at any time after, the happening of any of the above mentioned events. To the extent
not prohibited by applicable law, the aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such
Bank against such Credit Party or against any trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in
possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or
attachment creditor of such Credit Party, or against anyone else claiming through or
against such Credit Party or such trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession,
assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers or execution, judgment or attachment
creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been
exercised by such Bank prior to the making, filing or issuance, or service upon such Bank
of, or of notice of, any such petition, assignment for the benefit of creditors,
appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution,
subpoena, order or warrant. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the applicable Credit
Party, the Issuing Bank and the Agent after any such set-off and application made by such
Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
set-off and application.  </P>

applicable to the Credit Parties. The indemnity set forth herein shall be in addition to
any other obligations or liabilities of the Applicant and/or Co-Applicant to each
Indemnified Person under the Credit Documents or at common law or otherwise, and shall
survive any termination of the Credit Documents, the expiration of the Commitment and the
payment of all obligations of the Applicant and Co-Applicants under the Credit Documents,

Person with respect to any of the foregoing to the extent found in a final judgment of a

In connection with the preparation for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement, the undersigned has caused the preparation of and has reviewed projected
financial statements consisting of balance sheets and statements of income of the
Applicant giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. The

The undersigned has inquired of certain officers of the Applicant having responsibility

The undersigned has conferred with counsel to the Applicant for the purpose of discussing

3(c) and 3(d) below).  </P>

<U>Certifications</U>. Based on the foregoing, the undersigned hereby certifies as follows: </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)
The Applicant is not now, nor will consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement and the incurrence of the Obligations under the Agreement render the Applicant,
&#147;insolvent&#148; (as hereinafter defined). The undersigned understands that, in this
context, &#147;insolvent&#148; means that the present fair saleable value of assets is
less than the amount that will be required to be paid on or in respect of the existing
debts and other liabilities as such debts and liabilities of the Applicant mature. The
undersigned understands that the term &#147;debts&#148; includes any legal liability,
whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent,
including any guaranty obligations. A valuation of the Applicant, on the basis thereof,
with reasonable allowance for error, would reflect the net worth of the   </P>

After giving effect to the transaction contemplated by the Agreement, all accounts and
other liabilities of the Applicant are current and not past due.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)
The undersigned believes that, by incurring the Obligations pursuant to the Agreement,
the Applicant will not incur debts beyond its ability to pay as such obligations mature
(taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of the
Applicant&#146;s Indebtedness). The foregoing conclusion is based in part on the
projections, which demonstrate that the cash flow of the Applicant, after taking into
account all anticipated uses of the cash of the Applicant, will at all times be
sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of Indebtedness of the Applicant when such
amounts are required to be paid (including without limitation, scheduled payments
pursuant to the Agreement).  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)
As of the date hereof, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
will not leave the Applicant with &#147;unreasonably small capital&#148; within the
meaning of Section 548(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or with remaining assets that are
unreasonably small. In reaching this conclusion, the undersigned understands that &#147;unreasonably
small capital&#148; depends upon the nature of the particular business or businesses
conducted or to be conducted, and has reached this conclusion based on the needs and
anticipated needs for capital of the businesses conducted or anticipated to be conducted
by the Applicant in light of the Applicant&#146;s available credit capacity.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)
The Applicant has not executed the Agreement, or any documents mentioned herein, or made
any transfer or incurred any obligations thereunder, with intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Applicant.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f)
The undersigned understands that the Banks have performed their own review and analysis
of the financial condition of the Applicant, but that the Banks are relying on the
foregoing statements in connection with the extension of credit to the Applicant pursuant
to the Agreement.  </P>
