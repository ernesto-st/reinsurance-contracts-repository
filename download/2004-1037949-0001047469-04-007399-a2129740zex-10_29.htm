<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided
there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Revolver Lenders), the Borrower may from time to time, request
an increase in the Aggregate Commitments in an amount equal to the lesser of $50,000,000 and the Available Increase Amount. At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the
Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Revolver Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Domestic Business Days from the date of delivery
of such notice to the Revolver Lenders). Each Revolver Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by
an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested increase. Any Revolver Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase
its Commitment. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Revolver Lender of the Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested
increase, the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Increase Effective Date</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Revolver
Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date. As a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of
each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Revolver Lender) signed by the chief financial officer, treasurer or assistant treasurer (or any such officer's
designee, designated in writing by such officer) of such Loan Party (i)&nbsp;certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase and
(ii)&nbsp;in the case of the Company and the Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A)&nbsp;the representations and warranties contained in Article&nbsp;4
and the other Loan Documents are true and correct (or, with respect to any representation or warranty which is not qualified by materiality or material adverse effect, shall be true in all material
respects) on and as of the Increase Effective Date except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of
such earlier date, (B)&nbsp;no Default exists and (C)&nbsp;the sum of the Aggregate Commitments and the Outstanding Amount of the Term Loans does not exceed the Maximum Amount. The Borrower shall
prepay any Revolver Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.12) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolver
Loans ratable with any revised Pro Rata Shares arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section. </FONT></P>

Liens securing such Term Loans under the Collateral Documents are permitted under each then outstanding indenture of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (iii)&nbsp;the Term Maturity Date shall not be

Administrative Agent gives notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Company, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital

succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article&nbsp;shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30&nbsp;days following a retiring Administrative
Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall at its election nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided above. The Administrative Agent, if it so elects, may resign as administrative

obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to

a Lender with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent

appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note&nbsp;is issued to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent an
administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to

Company and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued by
