permitted by Applicable Law, interest at the Default Rate shall be added to the
Debt, shall itself accrue interest at the same rate as the Loan and shall be
secured by the Mortgage. This paragraph shall not be construed as an agreement
or privilege to extend the date of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of
any other right or remedy accruing to Lender by reason of the occurrence of any
Event of Default.

     2.2.7 Late Payment Charge. If any principal, interest or any other sums due
under the Loan Documents is not paid by Borrower on the date on which it is due,
Borrower shall pay to Lender, upon demand, an amount equal to the lesser of five
percent (5%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by Applicable
Law in order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing
such delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such
delinquent payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Borrower shall not be required to pay the late payment charge to
the extent sufficient amounts are deposited in the Deposit Account to satisfy
such obligations on the dates each such payment is required, regardless of
whether any of such amounts are so applied by Lender.

     2.2.8 Usury Savings. This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express
condition that at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay
interest on the principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject
Lender to either civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of
the Maximum Legal Rate. If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, Borrower is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the
principal balance due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate,
the Applicable Interest Rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be
deemed to be immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous
payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been
payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due
hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use,
forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread
throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the
rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum
Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan
for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

     2.3.2 Mandatory Prepayments. On each date on which Borrower actually
receives any Net Proceeds, if Lender is not obligated to make such Net Proceeds
available to Borrower for the restoration of the Property, Borrower shall prepay
the outstanding principal balance of the Note in an amount equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of such Net Proceeds. No Yield Maintenance Premium shall be due

partial prepayment under this Section shall be applied to the last payments of
principal due under the Loan.

<PAGE>

          (viii) Borrower shall deliver confirmation in writing from the
     applicable Rating Agencies to the effect that such release will not result
     in a downgrading, withdrawal or qualification of the respective ratings in
     effect immediately prior to such Defeasance Event for the Securities issued
     in connection with the Securitization which are then outstanding. If
     required by the applicable Rating Agencies, Borrower shall also deliver or
     cause to be delivered a non-consolidation opinion with respect to the
     Successor Borrower in form and substance satisfactory to Lender and the
     applicable Rating Agencies;

          (ix) Borrower shall deliver an Officer's Certificate certifying that
     the requirements set forth in this Section 2.4.1(a) have been satisfied;

          (x) Borrower shall deliver a certificate of Borrower's independent

     with the Defeasance Deposit generate monthly amounts equal to or greater
     than the Scheduled Defeasance Payments;

Lender as its agent and attorney-in-fact for the purpose of using the Defeasance
Deposit to purchase U.S. Obligations which provide Scheduled Defeasance Payments
on or prior to, but as close as possible to, all successive scheduled Payment
Dates after the Defeasance Date. Borrower, pursuant to the Security Agreement or
other appropriate document, shall authorize and direct that the payments
received from the U.S. Obligations may be made directly to the Deposit Account
(unless otherwise directed by Lender) and applied to satisfy the obligations of
Borrower under the Note. Any portion of the Defeasance Deposit in excess of the
amount necessary to purchase the U.S. Obligations required by this Section 2.4.1
and satisfy Borrower's other obligations under this Section 2.4.1 shall be
remitted to Borrower.

     (c) If Borrower has elected to defease the entire Note and the requirements
of this Section 2.4.1 have been satisfied, the Property shall be released from
the lien of the Mortgage and the Defeasance Collateral pledged pursuant to the
Security Agreement shall be the sole source of collateral securing the Note. In
connection with the release of the Lien, Borrower shall submit to Lender, not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the Defeasance Date (or such shorter time as
is acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion), a release of Lien (and related
Loan Documents) for execution by Lender. Such release shall be in a form
appropriate in the jurisdiction in which the Property is located and that
contains standard provisions protecting the rights of the releasing lender. In


                                       20

addition, Borrower shall provide all other documentation Lender reasonably
requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such release, together
with an Officer's Certificate certifying that such documentation (i) is in
compliance with all Legal Requirements, and (ii) will effect such release in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrower shall pay all costs, taxes
and expenses associated with the release of the lien of the Mortgage, including
Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees. Except as set forth in this Section 2.4.1
and Section 2.4.2, no repayment, prepayment or defeasance of all or any portion
of the Note shall cause, give rise to a right to require, or otherwise result
in, the release of the lien of the Mortgage on the Property.

     2.4.2 [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]

     2.4.3 Successor Borrower. In connection with a defeasance under this
Section 2.4, Borrower shall establish or designate a successor entity (the
"Successor Borrower") which shall be a single purpose bankruptcy remote entity
with two (2) Independent Directors approved by Lender, and Borrower shall
transfer and assign all obligations, rights and duties under and to the Note, as

Borrower. Such Successor Borrower shall assume the obligations under the Note,
as applicable, and the Security Agreement and Borrower shall be relieved of its
obligations under such documents. Borrower shall pay $1,000 to any such
Successor Borrower as consideration for assuming the obligations under the Note,
as applicable, and the Security Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no other assumption fee shall be payable upon a
transfer of the Note, as applicable, in accordance with Section 2.4.1 but
Borrower shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by Lender, including Lender's
attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred in connection therewith.

     Section 2.5 Release on Payment in Full. Lender shall, upon the written
request and at the expense of Borrower, upon payment in full of all principal
and interest on the Loan and all other amounts due and payable under the Loan
Documents in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Note and this Loan
Agreement, release the Lien of the Mortgage on the Property.

     4.1.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents by Borrower will not conflict with or
result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default

trust, loan agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement or instrument to
which Borrower is a party or by which any of Borrower's property or assets is

     4.1.16 Separate Lots. Except for any easement rights over adjacent land,

special or other assessments.

     4.1.18 Enforceability. The Loan Documents are not subject to any right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense by Borrower, including the defense
of usury, nor would the operation of any of the terms of the Loan Documents, or
the exercise of any right thereunder, render the Loan Documents unenforceable,
and Borrower has not asserted any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or
defense with respect thereto.

     4.1.19 No Prior Assignment. There are no prior assignments of the Leases or
any portion of the Rents due and payable or to become due and payable which are
presently outstanding.

     4.1.20 Insurance. Borrower has obtained and has delivered to Lender
certified copies of all insurance policies reflecting the insurance coverages,

     4.1.21 Use of Property. The Property is used exclusively as a retail
shopping center and other appurtenant and related uses.

     4.1.22 Certificate of Occupancy; Licenses. All certifications, permits,

<PAGE>

equipment, elevators, exterior sidings and doors, landscaping, irrigation
systems and all structural components, are in good condition, order and repair
in all material respects; except as disclosed in the Physical Conditions Report,
there exists no structural or other material defects or damages in any portion
of the Property, whether latent or otherwise, and Borrower has not received
notice from any insurance company or bonding company of any defects or
inadequacies in the Property, or any part thereof, which would adversely affect
the insurability of the same or cause the imposition of extraordinary premiums
or charges thereon or of any termination or threatened termination of any policy
of insurance or bond.

     4.1.25 Boundaries. Except as may be reported in the Survey, all of the
improvements which were included in determining the appraised value of the
Property lie wholly within the boundaries and building restriction lines of the

any of the improvements, so as to affect the value or marketability of the
Property except those which are insured against by title insurance.

     4.1.26 Leases. The Property is not subject to any Leases other than the
Leases described in Schedule I attached hereto and made a part hereof. No Person
has any possessory interest in the Property or any part thereof, or right to
occupy the same except under and pursuant to the provisions of the Leases. The
current Leases are in full force and effect and, except as may have been
reflected in any tenant estoppel certificates delivered to Lender or in Schedule
I, Borrower is not aware of any defaults thereunder by either party and there
are no conditions that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or
both, would constitute defaults thereunder on the part of Borrower or to
Borrower's knowledge, on the part of any tenant. No Rent (including security
deposits) has been paid more than one (1) month in advance of its due date.
Except as disclosed in the tenant estoppels or disclosed in Schedule I, all work
to be performed by Borrower under each Lease has been performed as required and
has been accepted by the applicable tenant, and any payments, free rent, partial
rent, rebate of rent or other payments, credits, allowances or abatements
required to be given by Borrower to any tenant have already been received by
such tenant. There has been no prior sale, transfer or assignment, hypothecation
or pledge of any Lease or of the Rents received therein. To Borrower's
knowledge, except as disclosed in the tenant estoppels or disclosed in Schedule
I, no tenant listed on Schedule I has assigned its Lease or sublet all or any
portion of the premises demised thereby to Borrower's knowledge; no such tenant
holds its leased premises under assignment or sublease, nor does anyone except
such tenant and its employees occupy such leased premises. Except as disclosed
in the tenant estoppels or disclosed in Schedule I, no tenant under any Lease
has a right or option pursuant to such Lease or otherwise to purchase all or any
part of the leased premises or the building of which the leased premises are a
part. Borrower is not aware that any hazardous wastes or toxic substances, as
defined by applicable federal, state or local statutes, rules and regulations,
have been disposed, stored or treated by any tenant under any Lease on or about
the leased premises except cleaning supplies used and stored in compliance with
law and inventory held for retail sale in compliance with law, nor does Borrower
have any knowledge of any tenant's intention to use its leased premises for any
activity which, directly or indirectly, involves the use, generation, treatment,
storage, disposal or transportation of any petroleum product or any toxic or
hazardous chemical, material, substance or waste except cleaning supplies used
and stored in compliance with law and inventory held for retail sale in
compliance with law. Schedule I attached hereto is true and complete in all
material respects.

     4.1.30 Single Purpose Entity/Separateness. Borrower represents, warrants
and covenants as follows:

     (a) The purpose for which Borrower is organized is and shall be limited
solely to (i) owning, holding, selling, leasing, transferring, exchanging,
operating and managing the Property, (ii) entering into this Loan Agreement with
Lender, (iii) refinancing the Property in connection with a permitted repayment
of the Loan and (iv) transacting any and all lawful business for which Borrower
may be organized under its constitutive law that is incident, necessary and
appropriate to accomplish the foregoing.

     (b) Borrower does not own and will not own any asset or property other than
(i) the Property, and (ii) incidental personal property necessary for and used
or to be used in connection with the ownership or operation of the Property.

     (c) Borrower will not engage in any business other than the ownership,
management and operation of the Property.

     (d) Borrower will not enter into any contract or agreement with any
Affiliate of Borrower, any constituent party of Borrower, any owner of Borrower,
any guarantors of the obligations of Borrower or any Affiliate of any
constituent party, owner or guarantor (collectively, the "Related Parties"),

                                       30
<PAGE>

past due and is not in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate; (iii) personal
property financing not in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate; and (iv)

not acquire obligations or securities of any Related Party.

     (g) Borrower is and will remain solvent and Borrower will pay its debts and
liabilities (including, as applicable, shared personnel and overhead expenses)
from its assets as the same shall become due.

     (h) Borrower will do all things necessary to observe organizational
formalities and preserve its existence, and Borrower will not, nor will Borrower
permit any Related Party to, amend, modify or otherwise change the partnership
certificate, partnership agreement, articles of incorporation and bylaws,
operating agreement, trust or other organizational documents of Borrower or such
Related Party without the prior written consent of Lender.

     (i) Borrower will maintain all of its books, records, financial statements
and bank accounts separate from those of any other Person and Borrower's assets
will not be listed as assets on the financial statement of any other Person;
provided, however, that Borrower's assets may be included in a consolidated
financial statement of a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") if inclusion on
such a consolidated statement is required to comply with the requirements of
GAAP. Borrower will file its own tax returns and will not file a consolidated
federal income tax return with any other Person; provided, however, that if such
Person is a corporation wholly owned by a REIT, such entity may be included in a
consolidated federal income tax return of the REIT if inclusion on such a

Internal Revenue Service. Borrower shall maintain its books, records,
resolutions and agreements as official records.

     (j) Borrower will be, and at all times will hold itself out to the public

and will hold all of its assets in its own name;


                                       31
<PAGE>

     (n) Borrower will not guarantee or become obligated for the debts of any
other Person and does not and will not hold itself out as being responsible for
the debts or obligations of any other Person.

     (o) If Borrower is a limited partnership or a limited liability company
(other than an approved single member limited liability company), at least one
general partner or member, or if Borrower is a general partnership at least two
general partners (each, an "SPC Party") shall be a corporation whose sole asset
is its interest in Borrower and each such SPC Party will at all times comply,
and will cause Borrower to comply, with each of the representations, warranties,
and covenants contained in this Section 4.1.30 as if such representation,
warranty or covenant was made directly by such SPC Party. Upon the withdrawal or
the disassociation of the SPC Party from Borrower, Borrower shall immediately
appoint a new member or general partner whose articles of incorporation are
substantially similar to those of the SPC Party and deliver a new Insolvency
Opinion to the Rating Agency or Rating Agencies, as applicable, with respect to
the new SPC Party and its equity owners. Notwithstanding anything to the

Borrower shall be a Delaware limited liability company that has at least (x) two
(2) springing members who are individuals acceptable to Lender and who shall
automatically become members of the limited liability company having a 0%
economic interest therein upon the occurrence of any event which would cause the
sole member of the limited liability company to cease to be a member thereof,
and (y) two (2) duly appointed Independent Directors (as hereinafter defined) as
directors or managers who may also be springing members, and has not caused or
allowed and will not cause or allow the directors or managers of such entity to
take any action requiring the unanimous affirmative vote of one hundred percent
(100%) of the members of its board of directors or its managers unless both
Independent Directors shall have participated in such vote;

     (q) Borrower shall at all times cause there to be at least two (2) duly
appointed members of the board of directors (an "Independent Director") of
Borrower (if a corporation) or of each SPC Party (if Borrower is a limited
partnership or a limited liability company) reasonably satisfactory to Lender
who is provided by a nationally recognized company that provides professional
independent directors and is not at the time of initial appointment and has not
been at any time during the preceding five (5) years and shall not be while
serving as an Independent Director: (i) a stockholder, director (other than as
an Independent Director of Borrower or of a special purpose corporation
affiliated with Borrower), officer, employee, partner, attorney or counsel of
Borrower or such SPC Party or any Affiliate of either of them; (ii) a creditor,
customer, supplier or other Person who derives any of its purchases or revenues
(other than any fees derived from the performance of standard corporate
representative services) from its activities with Borrower or such SPC Party or

control with any such stockholder, partner, creditor, customer, supplier or

policies or activities of a Person, whether through ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise.)

<PAGE>

     (r) Borrower shall not (and Borrower shall not cause or permit the board of
directors of an SPC Party) to take any action which, under the terms of any
applicable organizational document, requires the vote of the Independent
Directors unless at the time of such action there shall be at least two members
who are Independent Directors.

     (s) Borrower shall allocate fairly and reasonably any overhead expenses
that are shared with an Affiliate, including paying for office space and
services performed by any employee of an Affiliate or Related Party.

     (t) Borrower shall not pledge its assets for the benefit of any other
Person other than with respect to the Loan.

     (u) Borrower shall maintain a sufficient number of employees in light of
its contemplated business operations and pay the salaries of its own employees
from its own funds.

     (v) Borrower shall provide in its (i) operating agreement, if it is a
limited liability company, (ii) limited partnership agreement, if it is a
limited partnership or (iii) certificate of incorporation, if it is a
corporation, that for so long as the Loan is outstanding pursuant to the Note,
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, it shall not file or consent to the
filing of any petition, either voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of
any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization statute, or
make an assignment for the benefit of creditors without the affirmative vote of
each of the Independent Directors and of all other general partners/managing
members/directors.

     (w) Borrower shall conduct its business so that the assumptions made with
respect to Borrower in the Insolvency Opinion shall be true and correct in all
respects.

     4.1.31 Management Agreement. The Management Agreement is in full force and
effect and there is no default thereunder by any party thereto and no event has
occurred that, with the passage of time and/or the giving of notice would
constitute a default thereunder.

not limited to, the financial statements attached hereto as Schedule III), the
rent roll attached hereto as Schedule I, reports, certificates and other
documents submitted in connection with the Loan or in satisfaction of the terms
thereof and all statements of fact made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any
other Loan Document, are accurate, complete and correct in all material
respects. There has been no material adverse change in any condition, fact,
circumstance or event that would make any such information inaccurate,
incomplete or otherwise misleading in any material respect or that otherwise
materially and adversely affects or might materially and adversely affect the
Property or the business operations or the financial condition of Borrower.
Borrower has disclosed to Lender all material facts and has not failed to
disclose any material fact that could cause any representation or warranty made
herein to be materially misleading.

(excluding the limited partners of Guarantor), as applicable, have been or will
be derived from any unlawful activity with the result that the investment in
Borrower or Guarantor, as applicable (whether directly or indirectly), is
prohibited by law or the Loan is in violation of law.

     Section 4.2 Survival of Representations.

     Borrower agrees that all of the representations and warranties of Borrower
set forth in Section 4.1 and elsewhere in this Agreement and in the other Loan

     V. BORROWER COVENANTS

     Section 5.1 Affirmative Covenants.

     From the date hereof and until payment and performance in full of all
obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents or the earlier release of the
Lien of the Mortgage (and all related obligations) in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower hereby covenants and
agrees with Lender that:

     5.1.1 Existence; Compliance with Legal Requirements; Insurance. Borrower
shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in
full force and effect its existence, rights, licenses, permits and franchises
and comply with all Legal Requirements applicable to it and the Property. There
shall never be committed by Borrower or any other Person in Borrower's
employment or control or involved with the operation of the Property any act or
omission affording any Governmental Authority the right of forfeiture as against
the Property or any part thereof or any monies paid in performance of Borrower's
obligations under any of the Loan Documents. Borrower hereby covenants and
agrees not to commit, permit or suffer to exist any act or omission affording
such right of forfeiture. Borrower shall at all times maintain, preserve and
protect all franchises and trade names and preserve all the remainder of its
property used by Borrower in the conduct of its business and shall keep the
Property in good working order and repair, and from time to time make, or cause
to be made, all reasonably necessary repairs, renewals, replacements,
betterments and improvements thereto. Borrower shall keep the Property insured
at all times by financially sound and reputable insurers, to such extent and
against such risks, and maintain liability and such other insurance, as is more
fully provided in this Agreement.

     5.1.2 Taxes and Other Charges. Borrower shall pay all Taxes and Other
Charges now or hereafter levied or assessed or imposed against the Property or
any part thereof as the same become due and payable; provided, however,
Borrower's obligation to directly pay Taxes shall be suspended for so long as
Borrower complies with the terms and provisions of Section 7.2 hereof. Borrower
will deliver to Lender receipts for payment or other evidence satisfactory to
Lender that the Taxes and Other Charges have been so paid or are not then
delinquent no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the
Taxes and/or Other Charges would otherwise be delinquent if not paid (provided,
however, that Borrower is not required to furnish such receipts for payment of
Taxes in the event that such Taxes have been paid by Lender pursuant to Section
7.2 hereof). Borrower shall not suffer and shall promptly cause to be paid and
discharged any Lien or charge whatsoever which may be or become a Lien or charge
against the Property, and shall promptly pay for all utility services provided
to the Property. After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own
expense, may contest by appropriate legal proceeding, promptly initiated and
conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the amount or validity or
application in whole or in part of any Taxes or Other Charges, provided that (i)
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured; (ii) such
proceeding shall be permitted under and be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of any other instrument to which Borrower is subject and shall not
constitute a default thereunder and such proceeding shall be conducted in
accordance with all applicable statutes, laws and ordinances; (iii) neither the
Property nor any part thereof or interest therein will be in danger of being
sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost; (iv) Borrower shall promptly


                                       36
<PAGE>

upon final determination thereof pay the amount of any such Taxes or Other
Charges, together with all costs, interest and penalties which may be payable in
connection therewith; (v) such proceeding shall suspend the collection of such
contested Taxes or Other Charges from the Property; and (vi) Borrower shall
furnish such security as may be required in the proceeding, or as may be
reasonably requested by Lender, to insure the payment of any such Taxes or Other
Charges, together with all interest and penalties thereon. Lender may pay over
any such cash deposit or part thereof held by Lender to the claimant entitled
thereto at any time when, in the judgment of Lender, the entitlement of such
claimant is established.

     5.1.3 Litigation. Borrower shall give prompt written notice to Lender of
any litigation or governmental proceedings pending or threatened against
Borrower which might materially adversely affect Borrower's condition (financial
or otherwise) or business or the Property.

     5.1.4 Access to Property. Borrower shall permit agents, representatives and
employees of Lender to inspect the Property or any part thereof at reasonable
hours upon reasonable advance notice.

     5.1.5 Notice of Default. Borrower shall promptly advise Lender of any
material adverse change in Borrower's condition, financial or otherwise, or of
the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default of which Borrower has
knowledge.

     5.1.6 Cooperate in Legal Proceedings. Borrower shall cooperate fully with
Lender with respect to any proceedings before any court, board or other
Governmental Authority which may in any way affect the rights of Lender
hereunder or any rights obtained by Lender under any of the other Loan Documents
and, in connection therewith, permit Lender, at its election, to participate in

approval by Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Upon request, Borrower shall furnish Lender with
executed copies of all Leases. All renewals of Leases and all proposed Leases
shall provide for rental rates comparable to existing local market rates. All
proposed Leases shall be on commercially reasonable terms and shall not contain
any terms which would materially and adversely affect Lender's rights under the
Loan Documents. All Leases executed after the date hereof shall provide that
they are subordinate to the Mortgage and that the lessee agrees to attorn to

which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; (iii) shall not collect any of
the rents more than one (1) month in advance (other than security deposits);
(iv) shall not execute any other assignment of lessor's interest in the Leases
or the Rents (except as contemplated by the Loan Documents); (v) shall not
alter, modify or change the terms of the Leases in a manner inconsistent with


                                       41
<PAGE>

the provisions of the Loan Documents; and (vi) shall execute and deliver at the
request of Lender all such further assurances, confirmations and assignments in
connection with the Leases as Lender shall from time to time reasonably require.
If the correspondence from Borrower to Lender requesting approval for any matter
requiring Lender's approval under this Section 5.1.20 contains a bold faced,
conspicuous legend at the top of the first page thereof to the effect that "IF
YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN WRITING WITHIN 10 BUSINESS
DAYS, YOUR APPROVAL SHALL BE DEEMED GIVEN", and if Lender fails to respond in
writing to such request for approval within ten (10) Business Days after Lender
has received from Borrower such written request and all information reasonably
required by Lender in order to adequately review such request, Lender shall be
deemed to have given such approval.

     5.1.21 Alterations. Borrower shall obtain Lender's prior written consent to
any alterations to any Improvements, on the Property, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed except with respect to alterations that may
have a material adverse effect on Borrower's financial condition, the value of
the Property or the Net Operating Income. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Lender's consent shall not be required in connection with any alterations that
will not have a material adverse effect on Borrower's financial condition, the
value of the Property or the Net Operating Income, provided that such
alterations are made in connection with (a) tenant improvement work performed
pursuant to the terms of any Lease executed on or before the date hereof, (b)
tenant improvement work performed pursuant to the terms and provisions of a
Lease and not adversely affecting any structural component of any Improvements,
any utility or HVAC system contained in any Improvements or the exterior of any
building constituting a part of any Improvements, (c) alterations performed in
connection with the restoration of the Property after the occurrence of a
casualty in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement or (d)
alterations, additions, reconfiguration, renovations or demolition performed
with respect to the JC Penney Space following the expiration of the JC Penney
Lease pursuant to the terms and provisions of one or more Leases of the JC
Penney Space. If the total unpaid amounts due and payable with respect to
alterations to the Improvements (other than such amounts to be paid or
reimbursed by tenants under the Leases) shall at any time exceed Two Million
Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($2,500,000) (the "Threshold Amount"),
Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender as security for the payment of such
amounts and as additional security for Borrower's obligations under the Loan
Documents any of the following: (A) cash, (B) U.S. Obligations, (C) other
securities having a rating acceptable to Lender and that the applicable Rating
Agencies have confirmed in writing will not, in and of itself, result in a
downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if higher, then
current ratings assigned in connection with any Securitization, or (D) a
completion bond or letter of credit issued by a financial institution having a
rating by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group of not less than A-1+ if the term of
such bond or letter of credit is no longer than three (3) months or, if such
term is in excess of three (3) months, issued by a financial institution having
a rating that is acceptable to Lender and that the applicable Rating Agencies
have confirmed in writing will not, in and of itself, result in a downgrade,
withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if higher, then current ratings
assigned in connection with any Securitization. Such security shall be in an
amount equal to the excess of the total unpaid amounts with respect to
alterations to the Improvements on the Property (other than such amounts to be
paid or reimbursed by tenants under the Leases) over the Threshold Amount and
applied from time to time at the option of Lender to pay for such alterations or
to terminate any of the alterations and restore the Property to the extent
necessary to prevent any material adverse effect on the value of the Property.
Borrower may request a waiver from Lender of the requirement for such security,
and Lender shall respond to such request within ten (10) Business Days

     Personal Property, including contractual liability from Operation of
     Building Laws, Demolition Costs and Increased Cost of Construction
     Endorsements, in each case (A) in an amount equal to one hundred percent
     (100%) of the "Full Replacement Cost," which for purposes of this Agreement
     shall mean actual replacement value (exclusive of costs of excavations,

     depreciation; (B) containing an agreed amount endorsement with respect to
     the Improvements and Personal Property waiving all co-insurance provisions;
     (C) providing for no deductible in excess of Twenty-Five Thousand and
     No/100 Dollars ($25,000) for property damage and Fifty Thousand and No/100
     Dollars ($50,000) for flood; and (D) containing an "Ordinance or Law
     Coverage" or "Enforcement" endorsement if any of the Improvements or the
     use of the Property shall at any time constitute legal non-conforming
     structures or uses. In addition, Borrower shall obtain, if any portion of
     the Improvements is currently or at any time in the future located in a
     federally designated "special flood hazard area", flood hazard insurance in
     an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the outstanding principal balance of
     the Note or (2) the maximum amount of such insurance available under the
     National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
     1973 or the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each may be
     amended or such greater amount as Lender shall require, provided that the
     insurance pursuant to this sentence shall be on terms consistent with the
     comprehensive all risk insurance policy required under this subsection (i).

          (ii) commercial general liability insurance against claims for
     personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring upon, in

     "occurrence" form with a combined limit, including umbrella coverage, of
     not less than Sixty Million and No/100 Dollars ($60,000,000); (B) to
     continue at not less than the aforesaid limit until required to be changed
     by Lender in writing by reason of changed economic conditions making such
     protection inadequate; and (C) to cover at least the following hazards: (1)
     premises and operations; (2) products and completed operations on an "if
     any" basis; (3) independent contractors; (4) blanket contractual liability

     with loss payable to Lender; (B) covering all risks required to be covered
     by the insurance provided for in subsection (i) above; (C) containing an
     extended period of indemnity endorsement which provides that after the
     physical loss to the Improvements and Personal Property has been repaired,
     the continued loss of income will be insured until such income either
     returns to the same level it was at prior to the loss, or the expiration of
     [eighteen (18) months] from the date that the Property is repaired or
     replaced and operations are resumed, whichever first occurs, and


                                       48
<PAGE>

     notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such period;
     and (D) in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the projected
     Rents from the Property for a period of eighteen (18) months. The amount of
     such business income insurance shall be determined prior to the date hereof
     and at least once each year thereafter based on Borrower's reasonable
     estimate of the gross income from the Property for the succeeding eighteen
     (18) month period. All proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to this
     subsection shall be held by Lender and shall be applied to the obligations
     secured by the Loan Documents from time to time due and payable hereunder
     and under the Note; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall
     be deemed to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the obligations
     secured by the Loan Documents on the respective dates of payment provided
     for in the Note and the other Loan Documents except to the extent such
     amounts are actually paid out of the proceeds of such business income
     insurance;

     (B) the insurance provided for in subsection (i) above written in a
     so-called builder's risk completed value form (1) on an occurrence basis,
     (2) against all risks insured against pursuant to subsection (i) above, (3)
     including permission to occupy the Property, and (4) with an agreed amount
     endorsement waiving co-insurance provisions;

          (v) workers' compensation, subject to the statutory limits of the
     State, and employer's liability insurance with a limit of at least Five
     Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000) per accident and per disease
     per employee, and Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000) for
     disease aggregate in respect of any work or operations on or about the

     applicable);

          (vi) comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance, if applicable, in
     amounts as shall be reasonably required by Lender on terms consistent with
     the commercial property insurance policy required under subsection (i)
     above;

          (vii) automobile liability coverage for all owned and non-owned
     vehicles, including rented and leased vehicles containing minimum limits
     per occurrence, including umbrella coverage, of One Million and No/100
     Dollars ($1,000,000);

          (viii) earthquake insurance with coverage amounts of not less than the
     product of the "Probable Maximum Loss" applicable to the Property, as set
     forth in the seismic report satisfactory to Lender prepared by a seismic
     engineer or other qualified consultant, multiplied by the replacement cost
     of the Improvements as such replacement cost may be reasonably estimated by
     Lender, and with a deductible not to exceed 5% of the total insured value
     at risk, which coverage shall be issued by financially sound and
     responsible insurance companies authorized to do business in the State and
     having a claims paying ability rating of "A" or better by S&P and "A2" or


                                       49
<PAGE>

     better by Moody's, provided that Borrower may satisfy the ratings
     requirement of this Section by providing to Lender a "cut-through"
     endorsement or "fronted policy" in form and substance approved by Lender
     issued by an insurer with at least an "A" rating by S&P and "A2" or better
     by Moody's;

          (ix) insurance against terrorist acts as may be available on a
     commercial basis; and

          (x) upon sixty (60) days' written notice, such other reasonable
     insurance and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time to time may
     reasonably request against such other insurable hazards which at the time
     are commonly insured against for property similar to the Property located
     in or around the region in which the Property is located.

     (b) All insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a) shall be obtained under
valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "Policies" or in the singular,
the "Policy"), and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to insurance
companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The Policies shall be
issued by financially sound and responsible insurance companies authorized to do
business in the State and having a claims paying ability rating of "A" or better
by S&P and "A2" or better by Moody's. The Policies described in Section 6.1
(other than those strictly limited to liability protection) shall designate
Lender as loss payee. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration dates
of the Policies theretofore furnished to Lender, certificates of insurance
evidencing the Policies accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender of
payment of the premiums due thereunder (the "Insurance Premiums"), shall be
delivered by Borrower to Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower may
satisfy the ratings requirement of this Section by providing to Lender a
"cut-through" endorsement or "fronted policy" in form and substance approved by
Lender issued by an insurer with at least an "A" rating by S&P and "A2" or
better by Moody's.

     (c) Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to the
Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder and shall
otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring only
the Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.1(a).

     (d) All Policies of insurance provided for or contemplated by Section
6.1(a), except for the Policy referenced in Section 6.1(a)(v), shall name
Borrower, or the Tenant, as the insured and Lender as the additional insured, as
its interests may appear, and in the case of property damage, boiler and
machinery, flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a so-called New York
standard non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the
loss thereunder shall be payable to Lender.

     (e) All Policies of insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a)(v) shall
contain clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

          (i) no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for Borrower,
     or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply with the
     provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of
     the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or
     enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is concerned;


                                       50
<PAGE>

          (ii) the Policy shall not be materially changed (other than to
     increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at least thirty
     (30) days' written notice to Lender and any other party named therein as an
     additional insured;

          (iii) the issuers thereof shall give written notice to Lender if the
     Policy has not been renewed fifteen (15) days prior to its expiration; and

          (iv) Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums thereon or
     subject to any assessments thereunder.

     (f) if at any time Lender has a good faith reason to believe that all
insurance required hereunder is not in full force and effect, Lender shall have
the right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Property, including, without
limitation, the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole
discretion deems appropriate. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with
such action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be
paid by Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the
Mortgage and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. Lender hereby acknowledges
that the Policies currently in effect at the Property are in compliance with the
requirements of this Section 6.1.

     Section 6.2 Casualty. If the Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in
whole or in part, by fire or other casualty (a "Casualty"), Borrower shall give
prompt notice of such damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and
diligently prosecute the completion of the repair and restoration of the
Property as nearly as possible to the condition the Property was in immediately
prior to such fire or other casualty, with such alterations as may be reasonably
approved by Lender (a "Restoration") and otherwise in accordance with Section
6.4. Borrower shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or not such costs
are covered by insurance. Lender may, but shall not be obligated to make proof
of loss if not made promptly by Borrower.

     Section 6.3 Condemnation. Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the
actual or threatened commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of any
portion of the Property and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers
served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such
proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its
expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including but not
limited to any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt
shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and
applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the
reduction or discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest
paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive
out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note.
If the Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority,
Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the


                                       51
<PAGE>

Property and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 6.4. If the
Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by
Lender of the Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency
judgment on the Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the
Award, or a portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

     Section 6.4 Restoration. The following provisions shall apply in connection
with the Restoration of the Property:

     (a) If the Net Proceeds shall be less than Two Million and No/100 Dollars
($2,000,000) and the costs of completing the Restoration shall be less than Two
Million and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000), the Net Proceeds will be disbursed by
Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all of the conditions set forth
in Section 6.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower delivers to Lender a written
undertaking to expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily complete with due
diligence the Restoration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     (b) If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater Two Million and No/100
Dollars ($2,000,000) or the costs of completing the Restoration is equal to or
greater than Two Million and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000) Lender shall make the
Net Proceeds available for the Restoration provided that each of the conditions
of Section 6.4(b)(i) are satisfied. The term "Net Proceeds" for purposes of this
Section 6.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance proceeds received by
Lender pursuant to Section 6.1 (a)(i), (iv), (vi) and (ix) as a result of such
damage or destruction, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
same ("Insurance Proceeds"), or (ii) the net amount of the Award, after
deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to,
reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting same ("Condemnation Proceeds"),
whichever the case may be.

          (i) The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower for
     Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

               (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

               (B) the REA Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and
          the Pad Stores shall make all necessary repairs and restorations to
          their improvements and Macy's shall continue be obligated to continue
          the operation of its store premises pursuant to the May Operating
          Covenant following completion of the Restoration for the duration of
          the May Operating Covenant;

               (C) At least (i) each Anchor Tenant and (ii) Leases demising in
          the aggregate a minimum of sixty-five percent (65%) of the non-anchor
          rentable space in the Property which has been demised under executed
          and delivered Leases in effect as of the date of the occurrence of
          such fire or other casualty or taking, whichever the case may be,
          shall remain in full force and effect during and after the completion
          of the Restoration (or binding leases have been executed by
          replacement tenants for such space), notwithstanding the occurrence of
          any such fire or other casualty or taking, whichever the case may be,
          and will make all necessary repairs and restorations thereto at their
          sole cost and expense.


                                       52
<PAGE>

               (D) Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon as reasonably
          practicable (but in no event later than one hundred eighty(180) days
          after such damage or destruction or taking, whichever the case may be,
          occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to satisfactory
          completion;

               (E) Lender shall be satisfied that any operating deficits,
          including all scheduled payments of principal and interest under the
          Note, which will be incurred with respect to the Property as a result
          of the occurrence of any such fire or other casualty or taking,
          whichever the case may be, will be covered out of (1) the Net
          Proceeds, (2) the insurance coverage referred to in Section
          6.1(a)(iii), if applicable, or (3) by other funds of Borrower;

               (F) Lender shall be satisfied that the Restoration will be
          completed on or before the earliest to occur of (1) the Maturity Date,
          (2) the earliest date required for such completion under the terms of
          any Leases for more than 10,000 square feet which if not completed
          would give rise to a termination of such Lease, (3) such time as may
          be required under applicable zoning law, ordinance, rule or regulation
          in order to repair and restore the Property to the condition it was in
          immediately prior to such fire or other casualty or to as nearly as
          possible the condition it was in immediately prior to such taking, as
          applicable or (4) the expiration of the insurance coverage referred to
          in Section 6.1(a)(iii);

               (G) the Property and the use thereof after the Restoration will
          be in compliance with and permitted under all applicable zoning laws,
          ordinances, rules and regulations;

               (H) the Restoration shall be done and completed by Borrower in an
          expeditious and diligent fashion and in compliance with all applicable
          Legal Requirements; and

               (I) such fire or other casualty or taking, as applicable, does
          not result in the loss of access to the Property or the Improvements.

          (ii) The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender in an interest-bearing
     account and, until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this
     Section 6.4(b), shall constitute additional security for the Debt and other
     obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be disbursed
     by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower from time to time during the
     course of the Restoration, upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to Lender
     that (A) all materials installed and work and labor performed (except to
     the extent that they are to be paid for out of the requested disbursement)
     in connection with the Restoration have been paid for in full, and (B)
     there exist no notices of pendency, stop orders, mechanic's or
     materialman's liens or notices of intention to file same, or any other
     liens or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever on the Property which have
     not either been fully bonded to the satisfaction of Lender and discharged
     of record or in the alternative fully insured to the satisfaction of Lender
     by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy.


                                       53
<PAGE>

          (iii) All plans and specifications required in connection with the
     Restoration shall be subject to prior review and acceptance in all respects
     by Lender and by an independent consulting engineer selected by Lender (the
     "Casualty Consultant") which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
     delayed. Lender shall have the use of the plans and specifications and all
     permits, licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection with the
     Restoration. The identity of the contractors, subcontractors and
     materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as the contracts under
     which they have been engaged, shall be subject to prior review and
     acceptance by Lender and the Casualty Consultant which approval shall not
     be unreasonably withheld or delayed. All costs and expenses incurred by
     Lender in connection with making the Net Proceeds available for the
     Restoration including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
     disbursements and the Casualty Consultant's fees, shall be paid by
     Borrower.

          (iv) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of
     the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually
     incurred from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration, as
     certified by the Casualty Consultant, minus the Casualty Retainage. The
     term "Casualty Retainage" shall mean an amount equal to ten percent (10%)
     of the costs actually incurred for work in place as part of the
     Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, until the Restoration
     has been completed. The Casualty Retainage shall in no event, and
     notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above in this Section
     6.4(b), be less than the amount actually held back by Borrower from
     contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The
     Casualty Retainage shall not be released until the Casualty Consultant
     certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been completed in accordance
     with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b) and that all approvals necessary
     for the re-occupancy and use of the Property have been obtained from all
     appropriate governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, and Lender
     receives evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the
     Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the
     Casualty Retainage; provided, however, that Lender will release the portion
     of the Casualty Retainage being held with respect to any contractor,
     subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as of the date upon
     which the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the contractor,
     subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily completed all work and has
     supplied all materials in accordance with the provisions of the
     contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's contract, the contractor,
     subcontractor or materialman delivers the lien waivers and evidence of
     payment in full of all sums due to the contractor, subcontractor or
     materialman as may be reasonably requested by Lender or by the title
     company issuing the Title Insurance Policy, and Lender receives an
     endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy insuring the continued priority
     of the lien of the Mortgage and evidence of payment of any premium payable
     for such endorsement. If required by Lender, the release of any such
     portion of the Casualty Retainage shall be approved by the surety company,
     if any, which has issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the
     contractor, subcontractor or materialman.

          (v) Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net
     Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.


                                       54
<PAGE>

          (vi) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance
     thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender in consultation with
     the Casualty Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of the
     costs which are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be incurred in
     connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower shall deposit
     the deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency") with Lender before any
     further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made. The Net Proceeds
     Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be held by Lender and shall be
     disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with the Restoration on
     the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and
     until so disbursed pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) shall constitute
     additional security for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan
     Documents.

          (vii) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining
     balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender after
     the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
     completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b), and the
     receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs
     incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full, shall
     be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of Default shall have
     occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this Agreement or any of
     the other Loan Documents.

          (viii) All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
     Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds
     pursuant to Section 6.4(b)(vii) may be retained and applied by Lender
     toward the payment of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such
     order, priority and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem
     proper, or, at the discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in
     whole or in part, to Borrower for such purposes as Lender shall designate,
     in its discretion.

          (ix) In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage, or other transfer of
     title to the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt all
     right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies that are not
     blanket Policies then in force concerning the Property and all proceeds
     payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at such
     foreclosure or Lender or other transferee in the event of such other
     transfer of title.


     VII. RESERVE FUNDS

     Section 7.1 Required Repair Escrow Fund.

     7.1.1 Deposits. Borrower shall perform the repairs at the Property as set
forth on Schedule II hereto (such repairs hereinafter referred to as "Required
Repairs"). Borrower shall complete each of the Required Repairs on or before the
deadline for each repair as set forth on Schedule II. On the Closing Date,
Borrower shall deposit with Lender the amount, if any, set forth on Schedule II
to perform each of the Required Repairs. Amounts so deposited with Lender shall
be held by Lender in an interest bearing account and shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Required Repair Fund" and the account in which such amounts
are held shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Required Repair Account".


                                       55
<PAGE>

     7.1.2 Release of Required Repair Funds. ii) Lender shall disburse to
Borrower the Required Repair Funds from the Required Repair Account from time to
time upon satisfaction by Borrower of each of the following conditions: (i)
Borrower shall submit a written request for payment to Lender at least thirty
(30) days prior to the date on which Borrower requests such payment be made and
specifies the Required Repairs to be paid, (ii) on the date such request is
received by Lender and on the date such payment is to be made, no Default or
Event of Default shall exist and remain uncured, (iii) Lender shall have
received a certificate from Borrower (A) stating that all Required Repairs to be
funded by the requested disbursement have been completed in good and workmanlike
manner and in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements, such
certificate to be accompanied by a copy of any license, permit or other approval
by any Governmental Authority required to commence and/or complete the Required
Repairs, (B) identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor in
connection with the Required Repairs performed to be funded by the requested
disbursement, and (C) stating that each such Person has been paid in full or
will be paid in full upon such disbursement, such certificate to be accompanied
by lien waivers or other evidence of payment satisfactory to Lender, (iv)
intentionally deleted; and (v) Lender shall have received such other evidence as
Lender shall reasonably request that the Required Repairs to be funded by the
requested disbursement have been completed and are paid for or will be paid upon
such disbursement to Borrower. Lender shall not be required to make
disbursements from the Required Repair Account unless such requested
disbursement is in an amount greater than $25,000 (or a lesser amount if the
total amount in the Required Repair Account is less than $25,000, in which case
only one disbursement of the amount remaining in the Required Repair Account
shall be made) and such disbursement shall be made only upon satisfaction of
each condition contained in this Section 7.1.2. Each disbursement for a
completed Required Repair shall be in the full amount of all remaining funds
reserved for such Required Repair on Schedule II.

     (b) If (i) the cost of a Required Repair exceeds $25,000, (ii) the
contractor performing such Required Repair requires periodic payments pursuant
to terms of a written contract, and (iii) Lender has approved in writing in
advance such periodic payments, a request for reimbursement from the Required
Repair Account may be made after completion of a portion of the work under such
contract, provided (A) such contract requires payment upon completion of such
portion of the work, (B) the materials for which the request is made are on site
at the Property and are properly secured or have been installed in the Property,
(C) all other conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have been satisfied,
(D) funds remaining in the Required Repair Account are, in Lender's judgment,
sufficient to complete such Required Repair and all other Required Repairs, and
(E) if required by Lender, each contractor or subcontractor receiving payments
under such contract shall provide a waiver of lien with respect to amounts which
have been paid to that contractor or subcontractor.

     Section 7.2 Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund.

     Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date (a) one-twelfth of the
Taxes that Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12)
months in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Taxes
at least thirty (30) days prior to their respective due dates, and (b) except as
otherwise set forth in this Section 7.2, one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums
that Lender estimates will be payable for the renewal of the coverage afforded
by the Policies upon the expiration thereof in order to accumulate with Lender
sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days


                                       56
<PAGE>

prior to the expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above
hereinafter called the "Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that the Policies are blanket insurance policies
covering other properties of Affiliates of Borrower and provided no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower shall not be required to
deposit into the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund for Insurance Premiums. The Tax
and Insurance Escrow Fund and the payments of interest or principal or both,
payable pursuant to the Note, shall be added together and shall be paid as an
aggregate sum by Borrower to Lender. Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance
Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and (if Borrower has made the deposits required
by clause (b) above) Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant
to Section 5.1.2 hereof and under the Mortgage. In making any payment relating
to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill,
statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect
to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without
inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the
validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim
thereof. If the amount of the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the
amounts due for Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof,
Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit
such excess against future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow
Fund. Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund after the Debt
has been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower. If at any time Lender
reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not
be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (a)
and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower
shall increase its monthly payments to Lender by the amount that Lender
estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30) days
prior to delinquency of the Taxes and/or thirty (30) days prior to expiration of
the Policies, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as (A)
Borrower provides to Lender evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that all
insurance premiums otherwise due hereunder have been paid pursuant to Borrower's
blanket insurance policy, which policy shall satisfy the conditions of Section
6.1 hereof, and (B) there shall be no Event of Default then continuing, then
Borrower shall have no obligation to escrow insurance premiums as set forth in
this Section 7.2 with respect to any such insurance covered by Borrower's
blanket insurance policy.

     Section 7.3 Replacements and Replacement Reserve.

     7.3.1 Replacement Reserve Fund. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the date
hereof and each Payment Date an amount equal to $5,170.78 (the "Replacement
Reserve Monthly Deposit") for replacements and repairs required to be made to
the Property during the calendar year (collectively, the "Replacements").
Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Replacement
Reserve Fund" and the account in which such amounts are held shall hereinafter
be referred to as the "Replacement Reserve Account". Lender may increase the
monthly amounts required to be deposited into the Replacement Reserve Fund upon
thirty (30) days notice to Borrower if Lender determines in its reasonable
discretion that an increase is necessary to maintain the proper maintenance and
operation of the Property.

     7.3.2 Disbursements from Replacement Reserve Account. (c) Lender shall make
disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account to pay Borrower only for the
costs of the Replacements. Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements
from the Replacement Reserve Account to reimburse Borrower for the costs of
routine maintenance to the Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed from
the Required Repair Fund.


                                       57
<PAGE>

     (b) Lender shall, upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction of
the requirements set forth in this Section 7.3.2, disburse to Borrower amounts
from the Replacement Reserve Account necessary to pay for the actual approved
costs of Replacements or to reimburse Borrower therefor, upon completion of such
Replacements (or, upon partial completion in the case of Replacements made
pursuant to Section 7.3.2(e)) as determined by Lender. In no event shall Lender
be obligated to disburse funds from the Replacement Reserve Account if a Default
or an Event of Default exists.

     (c) Each request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account
shall be in a form specified or approved by Lender and shall specify (i) the
specific Replacements for which the disbursement is requested, (ii) the price of
all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any Replacement, and (iii)
the cost of all contracted labor or other services applicable to each
Replacement for which such request for disbursement is made. With each request
Borrower shall certify that all Replacements have been made in accordance with
all applicable Legal Requirements of any Governmental Authority. Each request
for disbursement shall include copies of invoices for all items or materials
purchased and all contracted labor or services provided and, unless Lender has
agreed to issue joint checks as described below in connection with a particular
Replacement, each request shall include evidence satisfactory to Lender of
payment of all such amounts. Except as provided in Section 7.3.2(e), each
request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account shall be made only
after completion of the Replacement for which disbursement is requested.
Borrower shall provide Lender evidence of completion satisfactory to Lender in
its reasonable judgment.

     (d) Borrower shall pay all invoices in connection with the Replacements
with respect to which a disbursement is requested prior to submitting such
request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account or, at the request
of Borrower, Lender will issue joint checks, payable to Borrower and the
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic, subcontractor or other party to
whom payment is due in connection with a Replacement. In the case of payments
made by joint check, Lender may require a waiver of lien from each Person
receiving payment prior to Lender's disbursement from the Replacement Reserve
Account. In addition, as a condition to any disbursement, Lender may require
Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each contractor, supplier, materialman,
mechanic or subcontractor who receives payment in an amount equal to or greater
than $25,000 for completion of its work or delivery of its materials. Any lien
waiver delivered hereunder shall conform to the requirements of Applicable Law
and shall cover all work performed and materials supplied (including equipment
and fixtures) by that contractor, supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or
materialman through the date covered by the current reimbursement request (or,
in the event that payment to such contractor, supplier, subcontractor, mechanic
or materialmen is to be made by a joint check, the release of lien shall be
effective through the date covered by the previous release of funds request).

     (e) If (i) the cost of a Replacement exceeds $25,000, (ii) the contractor
performing such Replacement requires periodic payments pursuant to terms of a
written contract, and (iii) Lender has approved in writing in advance such
periodic payments, a request for reimbursement from the Replacement Reserve
Account may be made after completion of a portion of the work under such
contract, provided (A) such contract requires payment upon completion of such


                                       58
<PAGE>

portion of the work, (B) the materials for which the request is made are on site
at the Property and are properly secured or have been installed in the Property,
(C) all other conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have been satisfied,
(D) funds remaining in the Replacement Reserve Account are, in Lender's
judgment, sufficient to complete such Replacement and other Replacements when
required, and (E) if required by Lender, each contractor or subcontractor
receiving payments under such contract shall provide a waiver of lien with
respect to amounts which have been paid to that contractor or subcontractor.

     (f) Borrower shall not make a request for disbursement from the Replacement
Reserve Account more frequently than once in any calendar month and (except in
connection with the final disbursement) the total cost of all Replacements in
any request shall not be less than $25,000.00.

     7.3.3 Performance of Replacements. (d) Borrower shall make Replacements
when required in order to keep the Property in condition and repair consistent
with similar retail properties in the same market segment in the metropolitan
area in which the Property is located, and to keep the Property or any portion
thereof from deteriorating. Borrower shall complete all Replacements in a good
and workmanlike manner as soon as practicable following the commencement of
making each such Replacement.

     (b) Lender reserves the right, at its option, to approve all contracts or
work orders in excess of $25,000 with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers,
subcontractors, contractors or other parties providing labor or materials in
connection with the Replacements. Upon Lender's request, Borrower shall assign
any contract or subcontract to Lender.

     (c) In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that any
Replacement is not being performed in a workmanlike or timely manner or that any
Replacement has not been completed in a workmanlike or timely manner, Lender
shall have the option, after notice to Borrower giving a reasonable time period
to cure any such problem, to withhold disbursement for such unsatisfactory
Replacement and to proceed under existing contracts or to contract with third
parties to complete such Replacement and to apply the Replacement Reserve Fund
toward the labor and materials necessary to complete such Replacement, without
providing any prior notice to Borrower and to exercise any and all other
remedies available to Lender upon an Event of Default hereunder.

     (d) In order to facilitate Lender's completion or making of the
Replacements pursuant to Section 7.3.3(c) above, Borrower grants Lender the
right to enter onto the Property and perform any and all work and labor
necessary to complete or make the Replacements and/or employ watchmen to protect
the Property from damage. All sums so expended by Lender, to the extent not paid
from the Replacement Reserve Fund, shall be deemed to have been advanced under
the Loan to Borrower and secured by the Mortgage. For this purpose Borrower
constitutes and appoints Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full
power of substitution to complete or undertake the Replacements in the name of
Borrower. Such power of attorney shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an
interest and cannot be revoked. Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as
follows: (i) to use any funds in the Replacement Reserve Account for the purpose
of making or completing the Replacements; (ii) to make such additions, changes


                                       59
<PAGE>

and corrections to the Replacements as shall be necessary or desirable to
complete the Replacements; (iii) to employ such contractors, subcontractors,
agents, architects and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; (iv)
to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which are or may
become Liens against the Property, or as may be necessary or desirable for the
completion of the Replacements, or for clearance of title; (v) to execute all
applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by
any of the contract documents; (vi) to prosecute and defend all actions or
proceedings in connection with the Property or the rehabilitation and repair of
the Property; and (vii) to do any and every act which Borrower might do in its
own behalf to fulfill the terms of this Agreement.

     (e) Nothing in this Section 7.3.3 shall: (i) make Lender responsible for
making or completing the Replacements; (ii) require Lender to expend funds in
addition to the Replacement Reserve Fund to make or complete any Replacement;
(iii) obligate Lender to proceed with the Replacements; or (iv) obligate Lender
to demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Replacement.

     (f) Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and representatives
(including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or inspector) or
third parties making Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3 to enter onto
the Property during normal business hours (subject to the rights of tenants
under their Leases) to inspect the progress of any Replacements and all
materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all plans and shop
drawings relating to such Replacements which are or may be kept at the Property,
and to complete any Replacements made pursuant to this Section 7.3.3. Borrower
shall cause all contractors and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender or
Lender's representatives or such other persons described above in connection
with inspections described in this Section 7.3.3 or the completion of
Replacements.

     (g) Lender may require an inspection of the Property at Borrower's expense
prior to making a monthly disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account in
order to verify completion of the Replacements for which reimbursement is
sought. Lender may require that such inspection be conducted by an appropriate
independent qualified professional selected by Lender and/or may require a copy
of a certificate of completion by an independent qualified professional
acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of any amounts from the
Replacement Reserve Account. Borrower shall pay the expense of the inspection as
required hereunder, whether such inspection is conducted by Lender or by an
independent qualified professional.

     (h) The Replacements and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or any other
item comprising a part of any Replacement shall be constructed, installed or
completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's, materialman's or
other liens (except for those Liens existing on the date of this Agreement which
have been approved in writing by Lender).

     (i) Before each disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account, Lender
may require Borrower to provide Lender with a search of title to the Property
effective to the date of the disbursement, which search shows that no mechanic's
or materialmen's liens. or other Liens. of any nature have been placed against
the Property since the date of recordation of the Mortgage and that title to the
Property is free and clear of all Liens (other than the lien of the Mortgage and
any other Liens previously approved in writing by Lender, if any).


                                       60
<PAGE>

     (j) All Replacements shall comply with all applicable Legal Requirements of
all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the Property and
applicable insurance requirements including, without limitation, applicable
building codes, special use permits, environmental regulations, and requirements
of insurance underwriters.

     (k) In addition to any insurance required under the Loan Documents,
Borrower shall provide or cause to be provided workmen's compensation insurance,
builder's risk, and public liability insurance and other insurance to the extent
required under Applicable Law in connection with a particular Replacement. All
such policies shall be in form and amount reasonably satisfactory to Lender. All
such policies which can be endorsed with standard mortgagee clauses making loss
payable to Lender or its assigns shall be so endorsed. Certified copies of such
policies shall be delivered to Lender.

     7.3.4 Failure to Make Replacements. (e) It shall be an Event of Default
under this Agreement if Borrower fails to comply with any provision of this
Section 7.3 and such failure is not cured within thirty (30) days after notice
from Lender. Upon the occurrence of such an Event of Default, Lender may use the
Replacement Reserve Fund (or any portion thereof) for any purpose, including but
not limited to completion of the Replacements as provided in Section 7.3.3, or
for any other repair or replacement to the Property or toward payment of the
Debt in such order, proportion and priority as Lender may determine in its sole
discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and apply the Replacement Reserve Funds
shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided to Lender under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any
portion of the Replacement Reserve Fund on account of an Event of Default to
payment of the Debt or in any specific order or priority.

     7.3.5 Balance in the Replacement Reserve Account. The insufficiency of any
balance in the Replacement Reserve Account shall not relieve Borrower from its
obligation to fulfill all preservation and maintenance covenants in the Loan
Documents.

     7.3.6 Indemnification. Borrower shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender
harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands,
liabilities, losses, damages, obligations and costs and expenses (including
litigation costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) arising from or in
any way connected with the performance of the Replacements. Borrower shall
assign to Lender all rights and claims Borrower may have against all persons or
entities supplying labor or materials in connection with the Replacements;
provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such right or claim unless an
Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured.

<PAGE>

     7.4.1 Deposits to Rollover Reserve Fund. Borrower shall pay to Lender on
each Payment Date the sum of $23,750.00 (the "Rollover Reserve Monthly
Deposit"), which amounts shall be deposited with and held by Lender for tenant
improvement and leasing commission obligations incurred following the date
hereof (collectively, "Leasing Expenses"); provided, however, Borrower shall not
be required to make pay the Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposit to Lender during
such times as the balance in the Rollover Reserve Account exceeds $855,000.00.
In addition, Borrower shall pay to Lender for deposit in the Rollover Reserve
Account all Lease Termination Payments; provided, however, no Lease Termination
Payments contributed to the Rollover Reserve Account shall be counted towards
any balance in the Rollover Reserve Account which serves to limit future
contributions to the Rollover Reserve Account from the Rollover Reserve Deposit.
Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Rollover Reserve
Fund" and the account to which such amounts are held shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Rollover Reserve Account".

     7.4.2 Withdrawal of Rollover Reserve Funds. Lender shall make disbursements
from the Rollover Escrow Fund for tenant improvement and leasing commission
obligations incurred by Borrower. All such expenses shall be approved by Lender
in its reasonable discretion. Lender shall make disbursements as requested by
Borrower on a monthly basis in increments of no less than $5,000.00 upon
delivery by Borrower of Lender's standard form of draw request accompanied by
copies of paid invoices for the amounts requested and, if required by Lender,
lien waivers and releases from all parties furnishing materials and/or services
in connection with the requested payment. Lender may require an inspection of
the Property at Borrower's expense prior to making a monthly disbursement in
order to verify completion of improvements for which reimbursement is sought.
All earnings or interest on the Rollover Escrow Fund shall be and become part of
such Rollover Escrow Fund and shall be disbursed as provided in this Section
7.4.

     7.4.3 Letter of Credit in Lieu of Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposit.

     (a) In lieu of making any Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposit, Borrower may
deliver to Lender a Letter of Credit in the amount of the Rollover Reserve
Monthly Deposit.

     (b) Borrower shall give Lender no less than thirty (30) days notice of
Borrower's election to deliver a Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 7.4.3(a)
and Borrower shall pay to Lender all of Lender's reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses in connection therewith. Borrower shall not be entitled to draw
from any such Letter of Credit.

     7.4.4 Reduction of Letter of Credit. In the event that, after the delivery
of a Letter of Credit in accordance with 7.4.3(a) above, Borrower shall incur
Leasing Expenses that would be eligible for a disbursement from the Rollover
Reserve Fund, Borrower may, in lieu of receiving such disbursement, reduce the
amount of such Letter of Credit by a corresponding amount. Lender agrees to
execute such agreements or amendments reasonably requested by Borrower in order
to appropriately reduce the amount of such Letter of Credit. Borrower shall not
be permitted to reduce the Letter of Credit more than one (1) time in any
three-month period.

     7.7.1 Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security
interest in each of the Reserve Funds and any and all monies now or hereafter
deposited in each Reserve Fund as additional security for payment of the Debt.
Until expended or applied in accordance herewith, the Reserve Funds shall
constitute additional security for the Debt.

     7.7.2 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may, in addition
to any and all other rights and remedies available to Lender, apply any sums
then present in any or all of the Reserve Funds to the payment of the Debt in
any order in its sole discretion.

     7.7.3 The Reserve Funds shall not constitute trust funds and may be
commingled with other monies held by Lender.

earnings or interest on a Reserve Fund shall be added to and become a part of
such Reserve Fund and shall be disbursed in the same manner as other monies

     7.7.5 Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of
Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any Reserve

     7.8.1 Event of Default.

to (i) replace or extend any Letter of Credit prior to the expiration thereof or
(ii) replace any outstanding Letter of Credit within thirty (30) days of
Lender's notice that such Letter of Credit fails to meet the requirements set

of Default from occurring and shall not be liable for any losses due to the
insolvency of the issuer of the Letter of Credit as a result of any failure or
delay by Lender in the exercise of such rights, but if Lender draws on the

exist, Lender shall deposit the proceeds of such draw into the Reserve Fund with
respect to which such Letter of Credit was originally established.

which such Letter of Credit was established or to apply each such Letter of
Credit to payment of the Debt in such order, proportion or priority as Lender
may determine or to hold such proceeds as security for the Debt.

days prior to the date on which the outstanding Letter of Credit is scheduled to
expire; or (c) if Lender has received notice that the bank issuing the Letter of
Credit shall cease to be an Eligible Institution and Borrower has not, within
thirty (30) days after notice thereof, obtained a new Letter of Credit with an
Eligible Institution.

<PAGE>

          (vi) if Borrower or any guarantor under any guaranty issued in
     connection with the Loan shall make an assignment for the benefit of
     creditors;

          (vii) if a receiver, liquidator or trustee shall be appointed for
     Borrower or any guarantor under any guarantee issued in connection with the

     insolvent, or if any petition for bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement
     pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar federal or state law,
     shall be filed by or against, consented to, or acquiesced in by, Borrower
     or such guarantor, or if any proceeding for the dissolution or liquidation
     of Borrower or such guarantor shall be instituted; provided, however, if
     such appointment, adjudication, petition or proceeding was involuntary and
     not consented to by Borrower or such guarantor, upon the same not being
     discharged, stayed or dismissed within thirty (30) days;

          (viii) if Borrower attempts to assign its rights under this Agreement
     or any of the other Loan Documents or any interest herein or therein in
     contravention of the Loan Documents;

          (ix) if Borrower breaches any of the negative covenants contained in
     Section 5.2 or any covenant contained in Section 4.1.30 hereof;

          (x) with respect to any term, covenant or provision set forth herein
     which specifically contains a notice requirement or grace period, if
     Borrower shall be in default under such term, covenant or condition after
     the giving of such notice or the expiration of such grace period;

          (xi) [intentionally deleted];

          (xii) [intentionally deleted];

          (xiii) if Borrower shall continue to be in Default under any of the
     other terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement not specified in
     subsections (i) to (x) above, for ten (10) days after notice to Borrower
     from Lender, in the case of any Default which can be cured by the payment
     of a sum of money, or for thirty (30) days after notice from Lender in the
     case of any other Default; provided, however, that if such non-monetary
     Default is susceptible of cure but cannot reasonably be cured within such
     30-day period and provided further that Borrower shall have commenced to
     cure such Default within such 30-day period and thereafter diligently and
     expeditiously proceeds to cure the same, such 30-day period shall be
     extended for such time as is reasonably necessary for Borrower in the
     exercise of due diligence to cure such Default, such additional period not
     to exceed sixty (60) days; or

          (xiv) if there shall be default under any of the other Loan Documents
     beyond any applicable cure periods contained in such documents, whether as
     to Borrower or the Property, or if any other such event shall occur or
     condition shall exist, if the effect of such event or condition is to
     accelerate the maturity of any portion of the Debt or to permit Lender to
     accelerate the maturity of all or any portion of the Debt;


                                       65
<PAGE>

     (b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and at any time thereafter
Lender may, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant
to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or at law or in equity, take such
action, without further notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to protect
and enforce its rights against Borrower and in and to the Property, including,
without limitation, declaring the Debt to be immediately due and payable, and
Lender may enforce or avail itself of any or all rights or remedies provided in
the Loan Documents against Borrower and the Property, including, without
limitation, all rights or remedies available at law or in equity; and upon any
Event of Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above, the Debt and
all other obligations of Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
shall immediately and automatically become due and payable, without notice or
demand, and Borrower hereby expressly waives any such notice or demand, anything
contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

     Section 8.2 Remedies.

     (a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of
the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against
Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and
delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised
by Lender at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the
Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have
commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its
rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents. Any such actions taken by
Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently,
singly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as
Lender may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of
Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the
other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower
agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Lender is not subject to
any "one action" or "election of remedies" law or rule, and (ii) all liens and
other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall remain in full
force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against the
Property and the Mortgage has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized
upon in satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in full.

     (b) Intentionally Omitted.

     (c) Lender shall have the right from time to time to sever the Note and the
other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages and other
security documents (the "Severed Loan Documents") in such denominations as
Lender shall determine in its sole discretion for purposes of evidencing and
enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder. Borrower shall execute and
deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a
severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall request in order to
effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and
irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an
interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or
desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its
said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided, however, Lender shall not
make or execute any such documents under such power until three (3) days after
notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of Lender's intent to exercise its


                                       66
<PAGE>

rights under such power. Except as may be required in connection with a
securitization pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, (i) Borrower shall not be
obligated to pay any costs or expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution, recording or filing of the Severed Loan Documents, and
(ii) the Severed Loan Documents shall not contain any representations,
warranties or covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and any such
representations and warranties contained in the Severed Loan Documents will be
given by Borrower only as of the Closing Date.

     Section 8.3 Remedies Cumulative; Waivers.

     The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's rights, powers
and remedies may be pursued singly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time and
in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay or
omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of
Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a
waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or
Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver
of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any
remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

     IX. SPECIAL PROVISIONS

     Section 9.1 Sale of Notes and Securitization.

     At the request of the holder of the Note and, to the extent not already
required to be provided by Borrower under this Agreement, Borrower shall use
reasonable efforts to satisfy the market standards to which the holder of the
Note customarily adheres or which may be reasonably required in the marketplace
or by the Rating Agencies in connection with the sale of the Note or
participations therein or the first successful securitization (such sale and/or
securitization, the "Securitization") of rated single or multi-class securities
(the "Securities") secured by or evidencing ownership interests in the Note and
the Mortgage, including, without limitation, to:

     (a) (i) provide such financial and other information with respect to the
Property, Borrower and the Manager, (ii) provide budgets relating to the
Property and (iii) to perform or permit or cause to be performed or permitted
such site inspection, appraisals, market studies, environmental reviews and
reports (Phase I's and, if appropriate, Phase II's), engineering reports and
other due diligence investigations of the Property, as may be reasonably
requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or as may be
necessary or appropriate in connection with the Securitization (the "Provided
Information"), together, if customary, with appropriate verification and/or
consents of the Provided Information through letters of auditors or opinions of
counsel of independent attorneys acceptable to Lender and the Rating Agencies;


                                       67
<PAGE>

     (b) at Borrower's expense, cause counsel to render opinions, which may be
relied upon by the holder of the Note, the Rating Agencies and their respective
counsel, agents and representatives, as to non-consolidation, fraudulent
conveyance, and true sale and/or lease or any other opinion customary in
securitization transactions, with respect to the Property and Borrower and its
affiliates which counsel and opinions shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
holder of the Note and the Rating Agencies;

     (c) make such representations and warranties as of the closing date of the
Securitization with respect to the Property, Borrower, and the Loan Documents as
are customarily provided in securitization transactions and as may be reasonably
requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies and consistent with
the facts covered by such representations and warranties as they exist on the
date thereof, including the representations and warranties made in the Loan
Documents; and

     (d) execute such amendments to the Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, designating a new Determination Date) and organizational documents,
enter into a lockbox or similar arrangement with respect to the Rents and
establish and fund such reserve funds (including, without limitation, reserve
funds for deferred maintenance and capital improvements) as may be requested by
the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or otherwise to effect the
Securitization; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to modify
or amend any Loan Document if such modification or amendment would (i) change
the interest rate, the stated maturity or the amortization of principal set
forth in the Note, or (ii) modify or amend any other material economic term of
the Loan.

     Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing, Lender may in
Lender's sole discretion, at any time following the date hereof, elect to (i)
bifurcate the Note into two (2) or more notes and/or split the Mortgage into two
(2) or more mortgages of the same or different priorities or otherwise as
determined by and acceptable to Lender and/or (ii) divide the Note into multiple
components corresponding to tranches of certificates to be issued in a
Securitization each having a notional balance and an interest rate determined by
Lender; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to modify or
amend any Loan Document if the overall effect of such modification or amendment
would (y) change the initial weighted average interest rate, the maturity or
amortization or principal set forth in the Note, or (z) modify or amend any
other material economic term of the Note or the other Loan Documents.

     Section 9.2 Securitization Indemnification.

     (a) Borrower understands that certain of the Provided Information may be
included in disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization,
including, without limitation, a prospectus, prospectus supplement or private
placement memorandum (each, a "Disclosure Document") and may also be included in
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or provided or made available to
investors or prospective investors in the Securities, the Rating Agencies, and
service providers relating to the Securitization. In the event that the
Disclosure Document is required to be revised prior to the sale of all
Securities, Borrower will cooperate with the holder of the Note in updating the
Disclosure Document by providing all current information necessary to keep the
Disclosure Document accurate and complete in all material respects.


                                       68
<PAGE>

     (b) Borrower agrees to provide in connection with each of (i) a preliminary
and a private placement memorandum or (ii) a preliminary and final prospectus or
prospectus supplement, as applicable, an indemnification certificate (A)
certifying that Borrower has carefully examined such memorandum or prospectus,
as applicable, including without limitation, the sections entitled "Special
Considerations," "Description of the Mortgages," "Description of the Mortgage
Loans and Mortgaged Property," "The Manager," "The Borrower" and "Certain Legal
Aspects of the Mortgage Loan," and such sections (and any other sections
reasonably requested) do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (B)
indemnifying Lender (and for purposes of this Section 9.2, Lender hereunder
shall include its officers and directors) or any Affiliate of Lender ("Lehman")
that has filed the registration statement relating to the securitization (the
"Registration Statement"), each of its directors, each of its officers who have
signed the Registration Statement and each Person or entity who controls the
Affiliate within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Lehman Group"), and Lehman, each of its
directors and each Person who controls Lehman within the meaning of Section 15
of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the
"Underwriter Group") for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, the "Liabilities") to which Lender, the Lehman Group or the
Underwriter Group may become subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or
are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material
fact contained in such sections or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated in
such sections or necessary in order to make the statements in such sections or
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (C)
agreeing to reimburse Lender, the Lehman Group and the Underwriter Group for any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by Lender and Lehman in connection
with investigating or defending the Liabilities; provided, however, that
Borrower will be liable in any such case under clauses (B) or (C) above only to
the extent that any such loss claim, damage or liability arises out of or is
based upon any such untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished to Lender by or on behalf of
Borrower in connection with the preparation of the memorandum or prospectus or
in connection with the underwriting of the debt, including, without limitation,
financial statements of Borrower, operating statements, rent rolls,
environmental site assessment reports and property condition reports with
respect to the Property. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any
liability which Borrower may otherwise have. Moreover, the indemnification
provided for in Clauses (B) and (C) above shall be effective whether or not an
indemnification certificate described in (A) above is provided and shall be
applicable based on information previously provided by Borrower or its
Affiliates if Borrower does not provide the indemnification certificate.

     (c) In connection with filings under the Exchange Act, Borrower agrees to
(i) indemnify Lender, the Lehman Group and the Underwriter Group for Liabilities
to which Lender, the Lehman Group or the Underwriter Group may become subject
insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state in the Provided Information a material fact required
to be stated in the Provided Information in order to make the statements in the
Provided Information, in light of the circumstances under which they were made
not misleading and (ii) reimburse Lender, the Lehman Group or the Underwriter
Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by Lender, the Lehman
Group or the Underwriter Group in connection with defending or investigating the
Liabilities.

     (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9.2
of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this
Section 9.2, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have
to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that failure to notify
causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that any action is
brought against any indemnified party, and its notifies the indemnifying party
of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly
with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent
that it (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party
promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party.
After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party under this
Section 9.2 the indemnifying party shall be responsible for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however,
if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded
that there are any legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
parties that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to
select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise
participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party to
parties. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more
than one such separate counsel unless an indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or additional to those available to another indemnified party.

     (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 9.2(b)
or (c) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an indemnified party
in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be indemnifiable under
Section 9.2(b) or (c), the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof); provided, however, that
no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the
amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, the
following factors shall be considered: (i) Lehman's and Borrower's relative
knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which
claim was asserted; (ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or
omission; and (iii) any other equitable considerations appropriate in the
circumstances. Lender and Borrower hereby agree that it would not be equitable
if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita
allocation.

     (f) The liabilities and obligations of both Borrower and Lender under this
Section 9.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the satisfaction
and discharge of the Debt.

     Section 9.3 Intentionally Deleted.

     Section 9.4 Exculpation.

     Subject to the qualifications below, Lender shall not enforce the liability
and obligation of Borrower to perform and observe the obligations contained in
the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents by any action
or proceeding wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower, except
that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, an action for specific performance
or any other appropriate action or proceeding to enable Lender to enforce and
realize upon its interest under the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents, or in the Property, the Rents, or any other collateral
given to Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents; provided, however, that, except
as specifically provided herein, any judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be enforceable against Borrower only to the extent of Borrower's interest
in the Property, in the Rents and in any other collateral given to Lender, and
Lender, by accepting the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgage and the other Loan
Documents, agrees that it shall not sue for, seek or demand any deficiency
judgment against Borrower in any such action or proceeding under or by reason of
or under or in connection with the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgage or the
other Loan Documents. The provisions of this section shall not, however, (a)
constitute a waiver, release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or
secured by any of the Loan Documents; (b) impair the right of Lender to name
Borrower as a party defendant in any action or suit for foreclosure and sale
under the Mortgage; (c) affect the validity or enforceability of or any guaranty
made in connection with the Loan or any of the rights and remedies of Lender
thereunder; (d) impair the right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a
receiver; (e) impair the enforcement of the Assignment of Leases; (f) constitute
a prohibition against Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against Borrower, but

other appropriate action or proceeding in order for Lender to exercise its
remedies against the Property; or (g) constitute a waiver of the right of Lender
to enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower, by money judgment or
otherwise, to the extent of any loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, claim or
other obligation incurred by Lender (including attorneys' fees and costs
reasonably incurred) arising out of or in connection with the following:

          (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Borrower or any
     guarantor in connection with the Loan;

          (ii) the willful misconduct of Borrower or any guarantor in connection
     with the Loan;

          (iii) the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
     indemnification provision in the Environmental Indemnity or in the Mortgage
     concerning environmental laws, hazardous substances and asbestos and any
     indemnification of Lender with respect thereto in either document;


                                       71
<PAGE>

          (iv) the wrongful removal or destruction of any portion of the
     Property after an Event of Default that adversely affects the value of the
     Property;

          (v) the misapplication or conversion by Borrower of (A) any insurance
     proceeds paid by reason of any loss, damage or destruction to the Property,
     (B) any awards or other amounts received in connection with the
     condemnation of all or a portion of the Property, or (C) any Rents
     following an Event of Default;

          (vi) failure to pay charges for labor or materials or other charges
     that can create Liens on any portion of the Property;

          (vii) any security deposits, advance deposits or any other deposits
     collected with respect to the Property which are not delivered to Lender
     upon a foreclosure of the Property or action in lieu thereof, except to the
     extent any such security deposits were applied in accordance with the terms
     and conditions of any of the Leases;

          (viii) Borrower's indemnifications of Lender set forth in Section 9.2
     hereof;

          (ix) the first full monthly payment of principal and interest under
     the Note is not paid when due;

          (x) failure of Borrower to (A) permit on-site inspections of the
     Property, (B) provide financial information, (C) maintain its status as a
     single purpose entity or (D) appoint a new property manager upon the
     request of Lender after an Event of Default, each as required by, and in
     accordance with the terms and provisions of, this Agreement and the
     Mortgage;

          (xi) failure of Borrower to obtain Lender's prior written consent to
     any subordinate financing or other voluntary Lien encumbering the Property;
     or

          (xii) failure of Borrower to obtain Lender's prior written consent to
     any assignment, transfer, or conveyance of the Property or any interest
     therein as required by the Mortgage or hereunder.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Note or any
of the Loan Documents, (A) Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any right
which Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of
the Debt secured by the Mortgage or to require that all collateral shall
continue to secure all of the Debt owing to Lender in accordance with the Loan
Documents, and (B) the Debt shall be fully recourse to Borrower in the event
that any petition for bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement pursuant to
federal bankruptcy law, or any similar federal or state law, shall be filed by
or consented to by Borrower.

     Section 9.5 Termination of Manager.

     If (a) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (b) at
the Maturity Date, the Debt is not repaid in full, or (c) a default by Manager
under the Management Agreement shall have occurred and not be remedied within
any applicable grace or cure period provided therein or the Manager shall become


                                       72
<PAGE>

insolvent, Borrower shall, at the request of Lender, terminate the Management
Agreement and replace the Manager with a manager approved by Lender on terms and
conditions satisfactory to Lender, it being understood and agreed that the
management fee for such replacement manager shall not exceed four percent (4%)
of the gross income derived from the Property.

     Section 9.6 Servicer.

     At the option of Lender and at no expense to Borrower, the Loan may be
serviced by a servicer/trustee (the "Servicer") selected by Lender and Lender
may delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents to the Servicer pursuant to a servicing agreement (the
"Servicing Agreement") between Lender and Servicer.

     Section 10.8 Headings.

     The Article and/or Section headings and the Table of Contents in this
Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

     Section 10.9 Severability.

     Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any
provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under Applicable
Law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

     Section 10.10 Preferences.

     Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or reverse
and reapply any and all payments by Borrower to any portion of the obligations
of Borrower hereunder. To the extent Borrower makes a payment or payments to
Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to
be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law,
state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such
payment or proceeds received, the obligations hereunder or part thereof intended
to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full force and effect, as if
such payment or proceeds had not been received by Lender.

     Section 10.11 Waiver of Notice.

     Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever from
Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by Lender
to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

     Section 10.12 Remedies of Borrower.

     In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its agents
have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where by law
or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such agent, as
the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly, Borrower
agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any monetary
damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an action
seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto agree that
any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted reasonably shall
be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment.

     Section 10.13 Expenses; Indemnity.

     (a) Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to
reimburse, Lender upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements)
incurred by Lender in connection with (i) the preparation, negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and all the
costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for Borrower (including without
limitation any opinions requested by Lender as to any legal matters arising
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with respect to the Property);
(ii) Borrower's ongoing performance of and compliance with Borrower's respective
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date,
including, without limitation, confirming compliance with environmental and
insurance requirements; (iii) after an Event of Default, Lender's ongoing
performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied
with after the Closing Date; (iv) the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and administration of any consents, amendments, waivers or other
modifications to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other
documents or matters requested by Lender; (v) securing Borrower's compliance
with any requests made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement; (vi) the
filing and recording fees and expenses, title insurance and reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel for providing to Lender all required legal opinions, and
other similar expenses incurred in creating and perfecting the Liens in favor of
Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (vii) enforcing
or preserving any rights, in response to third party claims or the prosecuting
or defending of any action or proceeding or other litigation, in each case
against, under or affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
the Property, or any other security given for the Loan; and (viii) enforcing any
obligations of or collecting any payments due from Borrower under this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect to the Property or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements
provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency
or bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable
for the payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent the same arise by
reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of
Lender. Additionally, Borrower shall not be responsible for any costs incurred
by Lender in connection with a Securitization. Any cost and expenses due and
payable to Lender may be paid from any amounts in the Deposit Account.

     (b) Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lender from and
against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind
or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for Lender in connection with any investigative,
administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not
Lender shall be designated a party thereto), that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against Lender in any manner relating to or arising out of (i)
any breach by Borrower of its obligations under, or any material
misrepresentation by Borrower contained in, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or (ii) the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan
(collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, however, that Borrower
shall not have any obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such
Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or


                                       78
<PAGE>

willful misconduct of Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay
the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under Applicable Law
to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
Lender.

     Section 10.14 Schedules Incorporated.

     The Schedules annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein as a part of
this Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

     Section 10.15 Offsets, Counterclaims and Defenses.

     Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note and
the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to such documents which Borrower
may otherwise have against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated
counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by Borrower in any
action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such documents and any
such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or
defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

     Section 10.16 No Joint Venture or Partnership; No Third Party
Beneficiaries.

     (a) Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and lender. Nothing
herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership,
tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender nor
to grant Lender any interest in the Property other than that of mortgagee,
beneficiary or lender.

     (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the benefit
of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and Borrower
any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of any of
the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the obligations
of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and exclusively for the
benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to require
satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be entitled to
assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of strict
compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

     Section 10.17 Publicity.

     All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or their Affiliates
through any media intended to reach the general public which refers to the Loan
Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan Documents, to Lender, Lehman,
or any of their Affiliates shall be subject to the prior written approval of
Lender.

     Section 10.18 Waiver of Marshalling of Assets.

     To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its
successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Property, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the
marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead
exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters
whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan
Documents to a sale of the Property for the collection of the Debt without any
prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the
payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Property in preference to
every other claimant whatsoever.

     Section 10.19 Waiver of Counterclaim.

     Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

     Section 10.20 Conflict; Construction of Documents; Reliance.

     In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Loan Agreement
and any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Loan Agreement shall
control. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent
counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan
Documents and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of
construing their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower
acknowledges that, with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its
own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any
manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any
parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any
limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it
under any of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which
govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or
Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower,
and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take
any action on the basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of
any such rights or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the
business of real estate financings and other real estate transactions and
investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business
of Borrower or its Affiliates.

     Section 10.21 Brokers and Financial Advisors.

     Borrower hereby represents that it has dealt with no financial advisors,
brokers, underwriters, placement agents, agents or finders in connection with
the Loan transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Borrower hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind (including Lender's attorneys' fees
and expenses) in any way relating to or arising from a claim by any Person that
such Person acted on behalf of Borrower or Lender in connection with the Loan
transaction contemplated herein. The provisions of this Section 10.21 shall
survive the expiration and termination of this Agreement and the payment of the
Debt.


                                       80
<PAGE>

     Section 10.22 Prior Agreements.

     This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire agreement of
the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such parties,
whether oral or written, between Borrower and Lender are superseded by the terms
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     Section 10.23 Mezzanine Loan Option.

     Lender shall have the right at any time to divide the Loan into two parts
(the "Mezzanine Option"): a mortgage loan (the "Mortgage Loan") and a mezzanine
loan (the "Mezzanine Loan"). The principal amount of the Mortgage Loan plus the
principal amount of the Mezzanine Loan shall equal the outstanding principal
balance of the Loan immediately prior to the creation of the Mortgage Loan and
the Mezzanine Loan. In effectuating the foregoing, Mezzanine Lender will make a
loan to Mezzanine Borrower (as hereinafter defined); Mezzanine Borrower will
contribute the amount of the Mezzanine Loan to Borrower (in its capacity as
Borrower under the Mortgage Loan, "Mortgage Borrower") and Mortgage Borrower
will apply the contribution to pay down the Loan to its Mortgage Loan amount.
The Mortgage Loan and the Mezzanine Loan will be on the same terms and subject
to the same conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and
the other Loan Documents except as follows:

          (a) Lender (in its capacity as the lender under the Mortgage Loan, the
     "Mortgage Lender") shall have the right to establish different interest
     rates and debt service payments for the Mortgage Loan and the Mezzanine
     Loan and to require the payment of the Mortgage Loan and the Mezzanine Loan
     in such order of priority as may be designated by Lender; provided, that
     (i) the total loan amounts for the Mortgage Loan and the Mezzanine Loan
     shall equal the amount of the Loan immediately prior to the creation of the
     Mortgage Loan and the Mezzanine Loan, (ii) the weighted average interest
     rate of the Mortgage Loan and the Mezzanine Loan shall on the date created
     equal the interest rate which was applicable to the Loan immediately prior
     to creation of a Mortgage Loan and a Mezzanine Loan and (iii) the debt
     service payments on the Mortgage Loan note and the Mezzanine Loan note
     shall on the date created equal the debt service payment which was due
     under the Loan immediately prior to creation of a Mortgage Loan and a
     Mezzanine Loan.

          (b) The borrower under the Mezzanine Loan ("Mezzanine Borrower") shall
     be a special purpose, bankruptcy remote entity pursuant to applicable
     Rating Agency criteria and shall own directly or indirectly one hundred
     percent (100%) of Mortgage Borrower. The security for the Mezzanine Loan
     shall be a pledge of one hundred percent (100%) of the direct and indirect
     ownership interests in Mortgage Borrower.

          (c) Mezzanine Borrower and Mortgage Borrower shall cooperate with all
     reasonable requests of Lender in order to convert the Loan into a Mortgage
     Loan and a Mezzanine Loan and shall execute and deliver such documents as
     shall reasonably be required by Lender and any Rating Agency in connection
     therewith, including, without limitation, the delivery of a
     Nonconsolidation Opinion and the modification of organizational documents
     and loan documents. In the event Mortgage Borrower and/or Mezzanine


                                       81
<PAGE>

     Borrower fail to execute and deliver such documents to Lender within five
     (5) Business Days following such request by Lender, Mortgage Borrower
     and/or Mezzanine Borrower, as applicable, hereby absolutely and irrevocably
     appoint Lender as their true and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest,
     in their name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or
     desirable to effect such transactions, Mortgage Borrower and/or Mezzanine
     Borrower, as applicable, ratifying all that such attorney shall do by
     virtue thereof. Lender shall pay all costs and expenses in connection with
     the creation of the Mortgage Loan and the Mezzanine Loan and all
     requirements relating thereto.

     Borrower shall not be obligated to incur any material costs in connection
with this Section 10.23, other than Borrower's counsel's legal fees. It shall be
an Event of Default under this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents if Borrower or Mezzanine Borrower fails to comply with any of the
terms, covenants or conditions of this Section 10.23 after expiration of ten
(10) Business Days after notice thereof.

Property directing them to pay all Rents (including, without limitation, all
Lease Termination Payments) and other sums due under the Lease to which they are
a party directly into the Clearing Account, (iii) other than the Clearing
Account, there shall be no other accounts maintained by Borrower or any other
Person into which revenues from the ownership and operation of the Property are
deposited, and (iv) neither Borrower nor any other Person shall open any other
such account with respect to the deposit of income in connection with the
Property. Until deposited into the Clearing Account, any Gross Income from
Operations from the Property held by Borrower shall be deemed to be Account
Collateral and shall be held in trust by it for the benefit, and as the
property, of Lender and shall not be commingled with any other funds or property
of Borrower.

          (vi) Sixth, to the payment of Deposit Account Bank for fees and
