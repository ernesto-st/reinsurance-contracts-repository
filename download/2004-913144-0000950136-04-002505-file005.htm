                        AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES

The Advances. Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, to make Advances to the Borrower from time to time on any
Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the Termination
Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding such Lender's
Commitment. Each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall consist of Advances
of the same Type made on the same day by the Lenders ratably according to their
respective Commitments. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, the
Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay pursuant to Section 2.09 and
reborrow under this Section 2.01.

Making the Advances. (a) Each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later
than (x) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the
date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of
Eurodollar Rate Advances or (y) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the first
Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a
Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, by the Borrower to the Agent, which
shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier or telex. Each
such notice of a Borrowing (a "Notice of Borrowing") shall be by telephone,
confirmed immediately in writing, or telecopier or telex in substantially the
form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such
Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate
amount of such Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each
Lender shall, before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such
Borrowing make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the
Agent at the Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion
of such Borrowing. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment
of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such
funds available to the Borrower at the Agent's address referred to in Section
8.02.

         (b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding,
(i) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing if
the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $5,000,000 or if the
obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be
suspended pursuant to Section 2.07 or 2.11 and (ii) the Eurodollar Rate Advances
may not be outstanding as part of more than six separate Borrowings.

         (c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the
Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing
specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall
indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender
as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such
Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the
Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance,
as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

         (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to
the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent
such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such
Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not
have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the
Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the
case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the
Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such
Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.




                                       13

         (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as
part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to
be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

Fees. (f) Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the
account of each Lender a commitment fee on the aggregate amount of such Lender's
unused Commitment from the date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender and
from the effective date specified in the Assumption Agreement or in the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of
each other Lender until the Termination Date at a rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Percentage in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly
on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing June 30,
2004, and on the Termination Date.

         (g) Agent's Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for its own
account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between the Borrower and
the Agent.

Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a) Optional. The Borrower shall
have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent, to
terminate in whole or permanently reduce ratably in part the unused portions of
the respective Commitments of the Lenders, provided that each partial reduction
shall be in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof.

                  (b) Mandatory. On the second anniversary of the Effective
         Date, if the Required Lenders have made the amortization election in
         accordance with Section 2.05 prior to such date, and on each date that
         is three months or a multiple of three months after such second
         anniversary, the Commitments of the Lenders shall be automatically and
         permanently reduced on a pro rata basis by $5,000,000 on each such
         date.

Repayment of Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable
account of the Lenders on the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of
the Advances then outstanding. In addition, if the Agent, at the direction of
the Required Lenders, gives the Borrower notice not later than 60 days prior to
the second anniversary of the Effective Date that the Commitments of the Lenders
will amortize as set forth in Section 2.04(b), the Borrower shall, on each such
Business Day, repay to the Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders the
amount by which the aggregate principal amount of the Advances exceeds the
aggregate Commitments after giving effect to such reduction on such day,
together with accrued interest to the date of such payment on the principal
amount so repaid.

Interest on Advances. (h) Scheduled Interest. The Borrower shall pay interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each Lender from the date
of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the
following rates per annum:

                  (i) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is
         a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of
         (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) the Applicable
         Margin in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the
         last day of each March, June, September and December during such
         periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or
         paid in full.

                  (ii) Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such
         Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all
         times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x)
         the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Advance plus (y)
         the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable in arrears
         on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period
         has a duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs
         during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of
         such Interest Period and on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall
         be Converted or paid in full.

         (i) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, the Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders
shall, require the Borrower to pay interest ("Default




                                       14
<PAGE>


Interest") on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each
Lender, payable in arrears on the dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per
annum required to be paid on such Advance pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any
interest, fee or other amount payable hereunder that is not paid when due, from
the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full,
payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand,
at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum
required to be paid on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above,
provided, however, that following acceleration of the Advances pursuant to
Section 6.01, Default Interest shall accrue and be payable hereunder whether or
not previously required by the Agent.

Interest Rate Determination. (j) Citibank agrees to furnish to the Agent timely
information for the purpose of determining each Eurodollar Rate. The Agent shall
give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest
rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a)(i) or (ii), and the
rate, if any, furnished by Citibank for the purpose of determining the interest
rate under Section 2.06(a)(ii).

         (k) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Required
Lenders notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for
such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of
making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for
such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the
Lenders, whereupon (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance, and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances
into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify
the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist.

         (l) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest
Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions
contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Agent will
forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor,
Convert into Base Rate Advances.

         (m) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment
or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such Advances shall
automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

         (n) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of
the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and
(ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into,
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

         (o) If Moneyline Telerate Markets Page 3750 (or any successor page) is
unavailable and Citibank shall fail to furnish timely information to the Agent
for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Eurodollar Rate Advances,

                  (i) the Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower and the
         Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Eurodollar
         Rate Advances,

                  (ii) each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on
         the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert
         into a Base Rate Advance (or if any Advance is then a Base Rate
         Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and

                  (iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate
         Advances or to Convert Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
         suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders
         that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

Optional Conversion of Advances. The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon
notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion



                                       15
<PAGE>


and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.07 and 2.11, Convert all Advances of
one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances of the other Type;
provided, however, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base
Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Rate Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar
Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount specified
in Section 2.02(b) and no Conversion of any Advances shall result in more
separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(b). Each such notice of a
Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date
of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such
Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the initial
Interest Period for each such Advance. Each notice of Conversion shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

Prepayments of Advances. The Borrower may, upon notice at least two Business
Days' prior to the date of such prepayment, in the case of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, and not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such
prepayment, in the case of Base Rate Advances, to the Agent stating the proposed
date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is
given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the
Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part,
together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal
amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in
an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a
Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(c).

Increased Costs. (p) If, after the Effective Date, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law),
there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or
making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances (excluding for purposes
of this Section 2.10 any such increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other
Taxes (as to which Section 2.13 shall govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of
taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or
by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender is
organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision
thereof), then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender
(with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of
such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such
increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted
to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (q) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation
or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental
authority (whether or not having the force of law) introduced after the
Effective Date affects or would affect the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such
Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the
existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of
this type, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from
time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances,
to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to
be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder. A
certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such
Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (r) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to
demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred
more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower and
the Agent of any event described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section (a
"Change in Law") which gives rise to such increased costs and of such Lender's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs is retroactive, then the 90-day
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof.

Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender
shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank
or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or
its Eurodollar Lending Office to






                                       16
<PAGE>


perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or
maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, (a) each Eurodollar Rate Advance of
such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance and (b) the obligation of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Advances
or to Convert Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until
the Agent shall notify the Borrower and such Lender that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist.

Payments and Computations. (s) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder,
irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 1:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at the
Agent's Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to
be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or
fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.13 or
8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending
Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to
any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in
each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon any
Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of a Commitment Increase
pursuant to Section 2.17 or an extension of the Termination Date pursuant to
Section 2.18, and upon the Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement
and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and
after the applicable Increase Date or Extension Date, as the case may be, the
Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection
therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender.
Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the
information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(c), from
and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the
Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the
interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to
such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

         (t) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent
payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder or under the Note
held by such Lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the
Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.

         (u) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made
by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and
all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds
Rate and of fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days,
in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees
are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (v) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated
to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or fee, as the case may be;
provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or
principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar
month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

         (w) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior
to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent,
each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such
amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

Taxes. (x) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any
Lender or the Agent hereunder or under the Notes or any other documents to be
delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.12 or the
applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in
the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its overall net income,
and taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under
the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is





                                       17
<PAGE>


organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender,
taxes imposed on its overall net income, and taxes imposed on it in lieu of net
income taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or
any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments
hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the
Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any
sum payable hereunder or under any Note or any other documents to be delivered
hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.13) such
Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall
make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law.

         (y) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or
documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or any
other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement
or the Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (z) The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for and hold
it harmless against the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section 2.13) imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent
(as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall
be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may
be) makes written demand therefor.

         (aa) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02,
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the
extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment
thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

         (bb) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this
Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assumption
Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender
in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably
requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Lender remains
lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrower with
two original Internal Revenue Service forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or
any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service,
certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of
United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the
Notes. If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a
party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate
in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded
from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms
certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser
rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such
form; provided, however, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the
Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect of
United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then,
to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes
that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in
Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the
Lender assignee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this
subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information
necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof
by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably
considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the
Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such
confidential information.

         (cc) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to
provide the Borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document
described in Section 2.13(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in
law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to
the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required
to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document




                                       18
<PAGE>


otherwise is not required under subsection (e) above), such Lender shall not be
entitled to indemnification under Section 2.13(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes
imposed by the United States by reason of such failure; provided, however, that
should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a
form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the Borrower shall take
such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to
recover such Taxes.

                  (g) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.13 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether
voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or
otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to
Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.13 or 8.04(c)) in excess of its ratable share of payments
on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall
forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances
owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the
excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing
Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall
repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery
together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the
total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other
amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount
so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation
from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14 may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the
direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

Evidence of Debt. (dd) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time,
including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender
from time to time hereunder in respect of Advances. The Borrower agrees that
upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the
Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such
Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise)
the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall
promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such
Lender in a principal amount up to the Commitment of such Lender.

         (ee) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 8.07(d)
shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in
which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of
each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing
and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of
each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or
to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv)
the amount of any sum received by the Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each
Lender's share thereof.

         (ff) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant
to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant
to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of
principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such
account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error;
provided, however, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an
entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such
account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement.

Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and the
Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate
purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.



                                       19
<PAGE>


         Increase in the Aggregate Commitments. (a) The Borrower may, at any
time but in any event not more than once, by notice to the Agent, request that
the aggregate amount of the Commitment be increased by an amount of not less
than $10,000,000 (a "Commitment Increase") to be effective as of a date (the
"Increase Date") that is at least 90 days prior to the scheduled Termination
Date then in effect, as specified in the related notice to the Agent; provided,
however that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Commitments at
any time exceed $125,000,000 and (ii) on the date of any request by the Borrower
for a Commitment Increase and on the related Increase Date, (A) the Borrower's
Public Debt Rating shall be not lower than A from S&P and A2 from Moody's and
(B) the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 shall be satisfied.

         (b) The Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of a request by the
Borrower for a Commitment Increase, which notice shall include (i) the proposed
amount of such requested Commitment Increase, (ii) the proposed Increase Date
and (iii) the date (the "Commitment Date") by which Lenders wishing to
participate in the Commitment Increase must commit to an increase in the amount
of their respective Commitments. Each Lender that is willing to participate in
such requested Commitment Increase (each an "Increasing Lender") shall, in its
sole discretion, give written notice to the Agent on or prior to the Commitment
Date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its Commitment. If the
Lenders notify the Agent that they are willing to increase the amount of their
respective Commitments by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the
requested Commitment Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be
allocated among the Lenders willing to participate therein in such amounts as
are agreed between the Borrower and the Agent; provided, however, that in no
event shall the commitment of any Lender be increased by an amount greater than
the amount of increase such Lender has notified the Agent is acceptable to such
Lender.

         (c) Promptly following the Commitment Date, the Agent shall notify the
Borrower as to the amount, if any, by which the Lenders are willing to
participate in the requested Commitment Increase. If the aggregate amount by
which the Lenders are willing to participate in any requested Commitment
Increase on any such Commitment Date is less than the requested Commitment
Increase, then the Borrower may extend offers to one or more Eligible Assignees
to participate in any portion of the requested Commitment Increase that has not
been committed to by the Lenders as of the Commitment Date; provided, however,
that the Commitment of each such Eligible Assignee shall be in an amount of
$5,000,000 or more.

         (d) On the Increase Date, each Eligible Assignee that accepts an offer
to participate in a requested Commitment Increase in accordance with Section
2.17(c) (each such Eligible Assignee and each Eligible Assignee that agrees to
an extension of the Termination Date in accordance with Section 2.18(c), an
"Assuming Lender") shall become a Lender party to this Agreement as of such
Increase Date and the Commitment of each Increasing Lender for such requested
Commitment Increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount
allocated to such Lender pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.17(b)) as of
such Increase Date; provided, however, that the Agent shall have received on or
before such Increase Date the following, each dated such date:

                  (i) (A) certified copies of resolutions of the Board of
         Directors of the Borrower or the Executive Committee of such Board
         approving the Commitment Increase and the corresponding modifications
         to this Agreement and (B) an opinion of counsel for the Borrower (which
         may be in-house counsel), in substantially the form of Exhibit E
         hereto;

                  (ii) an assumption agreement from each Assuming Lender, if
         any, in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent
         (each an "Assumption Agreement"), duly executed by such Eligible
         Assignee, the Agent and the Borrower; and

                  (iii) confirmation from each Increasing Lender of the increase
         in the amount of its Commitment in a writing satisfactory to the
         Borrower and the Agent.

         On each Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 2.17(d), the Agent shall
notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) and the
Borrower, on or before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time), by telecopier or telex,
of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase to be effected on such Increase
Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to
each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date.



                                       20

         Extension of Termination Date. (a) At least 35 days but not more than
50 days prior to each anniversary of the Effective Date, the Borrower, by
written notice to the Agent, may request an extension of the Termination Date in
effect at such time by one year from its then scheduled expiration. The Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall in
turn, in its sole discretion, not later than 20 days prior to such anniversary
date, notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing as to whether such Lender
will consent to such extension. If any Lender shall fail to notify the Agent and
the Borrower in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the
Termination Date at least 20 days prior to the applicable anniversary date, such
Lender shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender with respect to such
request. The Agent shall notify the Borrower not later than 15 days prior to the
applicable anniversary date of the decision of the Lenders regarding the
Borrower's request for an extension of the Termination Date.

         (b) If all the Lenders consent in writing to any such request in
accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.18, the Termination Date in
effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable anniversary of the
Effective Date (the "Extension Date"), be extended for one year; provided that
on each Extension Date the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.02 shall
be satisfied. If less than all of the Lenders consent in writing to any such
request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.18, the Termination
Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable Extension Date
and subject to subsection (d) of this Section 2.18, be extended as to those
Lenders that so consented (each a "Consenting Lender") but shall not be extended
as to any other Lender (each a "Non-Consenting Lender"). To the extent that the
Termination Date is not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18
and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection
(c) of this Section 2.18 on or prior to the applicable Extension Date, the
Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole
on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action
by the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person; provided that such
Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 8.04, and its
obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive the Termination Date for such
Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. It is understood and agreed
that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made
by the Borrower for any requested extension of the Termination Date.

         (c) If less than all of the Lenders consent to any such request
pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.18, the Agent shall promptly so
notify the Consenting Lenders, and each Consenting Lender may, in its sole
discretion, give written notice to the Agent not later than 10 days prior to the
applicable anniversary of the Effective Date of the amount of the Non-Consenting
Lenders' Commitments for which it is willing to accept an assignment. If the
Consenting Lenders notify the Agent that they are willing to accept assignments
of Commitments in an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the Commitments
of the Non-Consenting Lenders, such Commitments shall be allocated among the
Consenting Lenders willing to accept such assignments in such amounts as are
agreed between the Borrower and the Agent. If after giving effect to the
assignments of Commitments described above there remains any Commitments of
Non-Consenting Lenders, the Borrower may arrange for one or more Consenting
Lenders or other Eligible Assignees as Assuming Lenders to assume, effective as
of the Extension Date, any Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment and all of the
obligations of such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement thereafter
arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Non-Consenting
Lender; provided, however, that the amount of the Commitment of any such
Assuming Lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than
$5,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is
less than $5,000,000, in which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of
such lesser amount; and provided further that:

                  (i) any such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender shall have
         paid to such Non-Consenting Lender (A) the aggregate principal amount
         of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the
         assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting
         Lender plus (B) any accrued but unpaid facility fees owing to such
         Non-Consenting Lender as of the effective date of such assignment;

                  (ii) all additional costs reimbursements, expense
         reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Lender,
         and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting
         Lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall
         have been paid to such Non-Consenting Lender; and




                                       21
<PAGE>


                  (iii) with respect to any such Assuming Lender, the applicable
         processing and recordation fee required under Section 8.07(a) for such
         assignment shall have been paid;

provided further that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.11,
2.14 and 8.04, and its obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive such
substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date of substitution. At least
three Business Days prior to any Extension Date, (A) each such Assuming Lender,
if any, shall have delivered to the Borrower and the Agent an Assumption
Agreement, duly executed by such Assuming Lender, such Non-Consenting Lender,
the Borrower and the Agent, (B) any such Consenting Lender shall have delivered
confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent as to the
increase in the amount of its Commitment and (C) each Non-Consenting Lender
being replaced pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall have delivered to the Agent
any Note or Notes held by such Non-Consenting Lender. Upon the payment or
prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, each such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender,
as of the Extension Date, will be substituted for such Non-Consenting Lender
under this Agreement and shall be a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement,
without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other Lenders, and
the obligations of each such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder shall, by the
provisions hereof, be released and discharged.

                  (d) If (after giving effect to any assignments or assumptions
pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.18) Lenders having Commitments
equal to at least 50% of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the
Extension Date consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution
or delivery of an Assumption Agreement or otherwise) not later than one Business
Day prior to such Extension Date, the Agent shall so notify the Borrower, and,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 3.02, the Termination
Date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one year period as
described in subsection (a) of this Section 2.18, and all references in this
Agreement, and in the Notes, if any, to the "Termination Date" shall, with
respect to each Consenting Lender and each Assuming Lender for such Extension
Date, refer to the Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each
Extension Date, the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without
limitation, each Assuming Lender) of the extension of the scheduled Termination
Date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the
Register the relevant information with respect to each such Consenting Lender
and each such Assuming Lender.


                                  ARTICLE III

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. The Borrower represents and
warrants as follows:

                  (a) Due Organization, Authorization, etc. Each of the Borrower
         and each Material Subsidiary (i) is a corporation duly organized,
         validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good standing under
         the laws of its jurisdiction of formation, (ii) is duly qualified to do
         business and (to the extent applicable) in good standing in each
         jurisdiction where, because of the nature of its activities or
         properties, such qualification is required except where the failure to
         qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) has the
         requisite corporate power and authority and the right to own and
         operate its properties, to lease the property it operates under lease,
         and to conduct its business as now and proposed to be conducted, and
         (iv) has obtained all material licenses, permits, consents or approvals
         from or by, and has made all filings with, and given all notices to,
         all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction, to the extent
         required for such ownership, operation and conduct (including, without
         limitation, the consummation of the transactions



                                       24
<PAGE>


         contemplated by this Agreement) as to each of the foregoing, except
         where the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
         The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of this
         Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
         and thereby are within its corporate powers and have been duly
         authorized by all necessary corporate action (including, without
         limitation, shareholder approval, if required). Each of the Borrower
         and its Subsidiaries has received all other material consents and
         approvals (if any shall be required) necessary for such execution,
         delivery and performance, and such execution, delivery and performance
         do not and will not contravene or conflict with, or create a Lien or
         right of termination or acceleration under, any Requirement of Law or
         Contractual Obligation binding upon the Borrower or its Material
         Subsidiaries. This Agreement and each of the Loan Documents is (or when
         executed and delivered will be) the legal, valid, and binding
         obligation of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in
         accordance with its respective terms, except as enforceability may be
         limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
         similar laws affecting creditors' rights against the Borrower generally
         or by general equitable principles; provided that the Borrower assumes
         for purposes of this Section 4.01(a) that this Agreement and the other
         Loan Documents have been validly executed and delivered by each of the
         parties thereto other than the Borrower. Schedule 4.01(a) sets forth
         all the jurisdictions in which the Borrower and each Material
         Subsidiary are qualified to do business as of the Effective Date.

         (b) Statutory Financial Statements. All books of account of each
Insurance Subsidiary fully and fairly disclose all of the transactions,
properties, assets, investments, liabilities and obligations of such Insurance
Subsidiary and all of such books of account are in the possession of each
Insurance Subsidiary and are true, correct and complete in all material
respects.

         (c) GAAP Financial Statements. (i) With respect to any representation

         (l) Subsidiaries. Schedule 4.01(l) as updated from time to time
pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(xii) contains a complete list of the Borrower's
Subsidiaries indicating which Subsidiaries are Material Subsidiaries.

         (m) Insurance Licenses. Schedule 4.01(m) lists all of the jurisdictions
in which any of the Insurance Subsidiaries hold licenses (including, without
limitation, licenses or certificates of authority from applicable insurance
departments), permits or authorizations to transact insurance and reinsurance
business (collectively, the "Licenses") and indicates the line or lines of
insurance which each such Insurance Subsidiary is permitted to be engaged in
with respect to each License therein listed as of the Effective Date. Each
Material Insurance Subsidiary has all necessary Licenses to transact insurance
business or reinsurance business, directly or indirectly, in each jurisdiction,
where such business requires any such Material Insurance Subsidiary to obtain a
License. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.01(m), to the best of the Borrower's
knowledge, no such License is the subject of a proceeding for suspension or
revocation or any similar proceedings, there is no sustainable basis for such a
suspension or revocation, and no such suspension or revocation is threatened by
the applicable insurance department where such suspension or revocation would
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (n) Taxes. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all tax
returns that are required to be filed by it, and has paid or provided adequate
reserves for the payment of all material taxes, including, without limitation,
all payroll taxes and federal and state withholding taxes, and all assessments
payable by it that have become due, other than (a) those that are not yet
delinquent or that are disclosed on Schedule 4.01(n) and are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves have
been established, and are being maintained, in accordance with GAAP or (b) those
which the failure to file or pay would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth in Schedule 4.01(n), on the Effective Date there is no
ongoing audit or, to the Borrower's knowledge, other governmental investigation
of the tax liability of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and there is no
unresolved claim by a taxing authority concerning the Borrower's or any such
Subsidiary's tax liability, for any period for which returns have been filed or
were due. As used in this Section 4.01(n), the term "taxes" includes all taxes
of any nature whatsoever and however denominated, including, without limitation,
excise, import, governmental fees, duties and all other charges, as well as
additions to tax, penalties and interest thereon, imposed by any Governmental
Authority.

         (o) Securities Laws. Neither the Borrower nor any Affiliate, nor anyone
acting on behalf of any such Person, has directly or indirectly offered any
interest in the Advances for sale to, or solicited any offer to acquire any such
interest from, or has sold any such interest to any Person that would subject
the issuance or sale of the Advances or any other liability to registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

         (p) Compliance with Laws. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any Requirements of Law of any Governmental
Authority, if the effect of such violation could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect and, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, no such
violation has been alleged and each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (i) has
filed in a timely manner all reports, documents and other materials required to
be filed by it with any Governmental Authority, if such failure to so file could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and the information
contained in each of such filings is true, correct and complete in all material
respects and (ii) has retained all records and documents required to be retained
by it pursuant to any law, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, policy, guideline
or other requirement of any Governmental Authority, if the failure to so retain
such records and documents could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                    THE AGENT

Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Agent
to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
discretion under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms
hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental
thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the
Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but
shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected
in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required
Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders
of Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any
action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to the
Loan Documents or applicable law. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt
notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement, except for its or
their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the
generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (i) may treat the Lender that made any
Advance as the holder of the Debt resulting therefrom until the Agent receives
and accepts an Assumption Agreement entered into by an Assuming Lender as
provided in Section 2.17 or 2.18 or an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by
such Lender, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in
Section 8.07; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the
Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible
to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written
or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement; (iv) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance, observance or
satisfaction of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on
the part of the Borrower or the existence at any time of any Default or to
inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower; (v)
shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the
perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to
be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier,
telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

Citibank and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment, the Advances made by it
and the Note issued to it, Citibank shall have the same rights and powers under
the Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated, include Citibank in its individual capacity. Citibank and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under
indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage
in any kind of business with, the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries and any
Person who may do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any such
Subsidiary, all as if Citibank were not the Agent and without any duty to
account therefor to the Lenders. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose
information obtained or received by it or any of its Affiliates relating to the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries to the extent such information was obtained or
received in any capacity other than as Agent.

Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial
statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently
and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement.




                                       36
<PAGE>


Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to the respective principal
amounts of the Advances then owed to each of them (or if no Advances are at the
time outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of their
Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement
(collectively, the "Indemnified Costs"), provided that no Lender shall be liable
for any portion of the Indemnified Costs resulting from the Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share
of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by
the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. In the case of any
investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs,
this Section 7.05 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or a third party.

Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice
thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed at any time with or
without cause by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the
Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent, which
successor shall be approved by the Borrower unless a Default has occurred and is
continuing. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the
retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders'
removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this
Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document,
nor consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required

         Castle, Delaware 19720, Attention: Bank Loan Syndications Department;
         or, as to the Borrower or the Agent, at such other address as shall be
         designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties and,
         as to each other party, at such other address as shall be designated by
         such party in a written notice to the Borrower and the Agent, provided
         that materials required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(i),
         (ii), (iii), (vi), (vii), (x), (xi) or (xii) shall be delivered to the
         Agent as specified in Section 8.02(b) or as otherwise specified to the
         Borrower by the Agent. All such notices and communications shall, when
         mailed, telecopied, telegraphed or e-mailed, be effective when
         deposited in the mails, telecopied, delivered to the telegraph company

         this Agreement or the Notes or of any Exhibit hereto to be executed and
         delivered hereunder shall be effective as delivery of a manually
         executed counterpart thereof.

                  (b) So long as Citibank or any of its Affiliates is the Agent,
         materials required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(i),
         (ii), (iii), (vi), (vii), (x), (xi) or (xii) shall be delivered to the
         Agent in an electronic medium in a format acceptable to the Agent and
         the Lenders by e-mail at oploanswebadmin@citigroup.com. The Borrower
         agrees that the Agent may make such materials, as well as any other
         written information, documents, instruments and other material relating
         to the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any other materials or
         matters relating to this Agreement, the Notes or any of the
         transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Communications")
         available to the Lenders by posting such notices on Intralinks,
         "e-Disclosure", the Agent's internet delivery system that is part of
         Fixed Income Direct, Global Fixed Income's primary web portal, or a
         substantially similar electronic system (the "Platform"). The Borrower
         acknowledges that (i) the distribution of material through an
         electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are
         confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution, (ii)
         the Platform is provided "as is" and "as available" and (iii) neither
         the Agent nor any of its Affiliates warrants the accuracy, adequacy or
         completeness of the Communications or the Platform and each expressly
         disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the Communications or
         the Platform. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory,
         including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness
         for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or
         freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by the Agent or any
         of its Affiliates in connection with the Platform.

                  (c) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the
         next sentence) (a "Notice") specifying that any Communications have
         been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such
         information, documents or other materials to such Lender for purposes
         of this Agreement; provided that if requested by any Lender, the Agent
         shall deliver a copy of the Communications to such Lender by email or
         telecopier. Each Lender agrees (i) to notify the Agent in writing of
         such Lender's e-mail address to which a Notice may be sent by
         electronic transmission (including by electronic communication) on or
         before the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from
         time to time thereafter to ensure that the Agent has on record an
         effective e-mail address for such Lender) and (ii) that any Notice may
         be sent to such e-mail address.

No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender or the Agent to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

Costs and Expenses. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay on demand all costs and
expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and the
other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, (A)
all due diligence, syndication (including printing, distribution and bank
meetings), transportation, computer, duplication, appraisal, consultant, and
audit expenses and (B) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent
with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Agent as to its rights and
responsibilities under this Agreement. The Borrower further agrees to pay on
demand all costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including,
without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses), in connection with
the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise)
of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the other documents to be
delivered




                                       38
<PAGE>


hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel for the Agent and each Lender in connection with the enforcement of
rights under this Section 8.04(a).

         (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and
each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their officers, directors,
employees, agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against
any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by or
asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of
or in connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in
connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a
defense in connection therewith) the Notes, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed
use of the proceeds of the Advances, except to the extent such claim, damage,
loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation,
litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 8.04(b)
applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation,
litigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its directors,
equityholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person, whether
or not any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Borrower also agrees not
to assert any claim for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
against the Agent, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory
of liability, arising out of or otherwise relating to the Notes, this Agreement,
any other Loan Document, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the
actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances.

         (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar
Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other
than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a
payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.07(d), 2.09 or 2.11, acceleration of
the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason,
the Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to
the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required
to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it
may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or Conversion, including,
without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or
expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

         (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in
Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 8.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal,
interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes.

Right of Set-off. Upon (i) the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the
consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to declare the Notes
due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, each Lender and each
of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and
other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such Affiliate to or for
the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations
of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the Note held
by such Lender, whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or such Note and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and
application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender and its
Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender and
its Affiliates may have.

Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective (other than Section 2.01,
which shall only become effective upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent
set forth in Section 3.01) when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and
the Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender
that such Initial Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their
respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the
right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior
written consent of the Lenders.

Assignments and Participations. (e) Each Lender may and, if demanded by the
Borrower (following a demand by such Lender pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11 or
2.13 or an assertion by such Lender under Section 2.11) upon at least 5 Business
Days' notice to such Lender and the Agent, will assign to one or more Persons
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it
and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such
assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights
and obligations under this Agreement, (ii) except in the case of an assignment
to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an
assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the
amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each
such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof unless the Borrower and the
Agent otherwise agree, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible
Assignee, (iv) each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 8.07(a) shall be arranged by the Borrower after
consultation with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the
rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement or an
assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with
another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the
rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (v) no
Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by
the Borrower pursuant to this Section 8.07(a) unless and until such Lender shall
have received one or more payments from either the Borrower or one or more
Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with
accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all
other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, and (vi) the parties
to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with any Note subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500; provided, however, that in the case of each assignment made as a result
of a demand by the Borrower, such recordation fee shall be payable by the
Borrower except that no such recordation fee shall be payable in the case of an
assignment made at the request of the Borrower to an Eligible Assignee that is
an existing Lender. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording,
from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance,
(x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder
and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.10,
2.13 and 8.04 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising
prior such assignment) and be released from its obligations (other than its
obligations under Section 7.05 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an
event arising prior such assignment) under this Agreement (and, in the case of
an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto).

         (f) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with any Loan Document or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created
or purported to be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning
Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or
observance by the Borrower of any of its obligations under any Loan Document or
any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee
confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of
the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an
Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion
under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof,
together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto;
and



                                       40
<PAGE>


(vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms
all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to be
performed by it as a Lender.

         (g) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee,
together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if
such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the
form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record
the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
thereof to the Borrower.

         (h) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 8.02
a copy of each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The entries
in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

         (i) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other
entities (other than the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any
Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations
under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the
Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of
this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant
under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or
waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by
the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or
consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or
other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation.

         (j) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation
or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 8.07, disclose
to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any
information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of
the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or
participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the
confidentiality of any Confidential Information relating to the Borrower
received by it from such Lender.

(k) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender
may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing to it
and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in
accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders agrees to take and to cause its Affiliates
to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to maintain the
confidentiality of all information identified as "confidential" or "secret" by
the Borrower and provided to it by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or by the
Agent on the Borrower's or such Subsidiary's behalf, under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such
information other than in connection with or in enforcement of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents or in connection with other business now or
hereafter existing or contemplated with the Borrower or any Subsidiary; except
to the extent such information (i) was or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of disclosure by such Lender, or (ii) was or
becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
Borrower, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement
with the Borrower known to such Lender; provided, however, that any Lender may
disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of
any Governmental Authority to which such Lender is subject or in connection with
an





                                       41
<PAGE>


examination of such Lender by any such authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or
other court process; (C) when required to do so in accordance with the
provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (D) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which the Agent or
any Lender or their respective Affiliates may be party; (E) to the extent
reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or
under any other Loan Document; (F) to such Lender's independent auditors and
other professional advisors; (G) to any assignee of a Lender, actual or
potential, provided that such Person agrees in writing to keep such information
confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders hereunder; (H) to any
Lender or its Affiliate, as expressly permitted under the terms of any other
document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which the Borrower or any
Subsidiary is party or is deemed party with such Lender or such Affiliate; and
(I) to its Affiliates which are such Lender's parent or it or its parent's
wholly owned Subsidiary or, with the prior written consent of the Borrower which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, its other Affiliates.

Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Jurisdiction, Etc. (l) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the United States
of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all
claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in any such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such
federal court. The Borrower hereby agrees that service of process in any such
action or proceeding brought in the any such New York State court or in such
federal court may be made upon CT Corporation System at its offices at 111
Eighth Avenue, 13th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10011 (the "Process Agent") and the
Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Process Agent its authorized agent to
accept such service of process, and agrees that the failure of the Process Agent
to give any notice of any such service shall not impair or affect the validity
of such service or of any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based
thereon. The Borrower hereby further irrevocably consents to the service of
process in any action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing thereof by any
parties hereto by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Borrower
at its address specified pursuant to Section 8.02. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction.

         (m) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New
York State or federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

Judgment. (n) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is
necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in U.S. dollars into another currency,
the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so,
that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
banking procedures the Agent could purchase U.S. dollars with such other
currency at Citibank's principal office in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on
the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.

         (o) The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in
any currency (the "Primary Currency") to any Lender or the Agent hereunder
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to
the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such




                                       42
<PAGE>


other currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance
with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with
such other currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so
purchased is less than such sum due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may
be) in the applicable Primary Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate
obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or
the Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of the
applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or
the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, such Lender
or the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to the Borrower such excess.

Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders hereby
irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to any Loan Document, the Advances or the actions of the Agent or any
Lender in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized,
as of the date first above written.
