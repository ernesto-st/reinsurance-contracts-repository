                            GENERAL AGENT CONTINGENT
                           PROFIT COMMISSION ADDENDUM




         This Addendum, effective January 1, 2001, made by and between
Penn-America Insurance Company and Penn-Star Insurance Company (hereinafter
collectively referred to as "Penn-America") and [[MANNAM]] (hereinafter referred
to as "Agent"), supersedes and replaces, in its entirety, the General Agency
Profit Sharing Addendum effective January 1, 1999 ("the 1999 Addendum"), by and
between the parties hereto, and forms a part of the General Agency Agreement by
and between Penn-America and Agent dated [[CNTDATE]], and any amendments
thereto, as follows.

1.       Agreement: It is agreed that as a reward to Agent for Agent's favorable
         underwriting results, Penn-America will pay to Agent, in addition to
         the commissions payable in accordance with the General Agency
         Agreement, a contingent profit commission based on the underwriting
         profits realized by Penn-America on the business written by Agent under
         the General Agency Agreement, except such business as is ineligible
         herein;

2.       Ineligible Business: This Addendum shall not apply to premiums, losses
         and expenses applicable to the following businesses: (a) assigned risk;
         (b) umbrella policies; (c) that portion of any premiums, losses and
         expenses relating to a limit of liability in excess of $1 million,
         pursuant to Penn-America's Increased General Liability Limits Program;
         (d) personal and commercial automobile liability and physical damage;
         and (e) any business hereinafter deemed ineligible by Penn-America;

3.       Contingent Profit Commission: If Agent meets the terms, conditions and
         qualifications set forth herein, Agent shall be entitled to a
         contingent profit commission, calculated as follows:

         a.       By March 1 of the year following the contingent year,
                  Penn-America shall perform the following calculation;

                  (1)      Determine a combined ratio for all eligible business
                           written by the Agent in the aggregate during the
                           contingent year and two (2) immediately preceding
                           calendar years. Said combined ratio shall be the sum
                           of the "Loss and LAE (Loss Adjustment Expenses)
                           Incurred Ratio", "Commissions and Filed Fees Ratio",
                           "Premium Tax Ratio" and "Company Expense Ratio"
                           during the contingent year and two (2) immediately
                           preceding calendar years;

                  (2)      Determine the growth rate in written premium between
                           the contingent year and the immediately preceding
                           calendar year;

                  (3)      Apply the combined ratio and growth rate to the
                           Contingent Profit Commission Table, attached hereto
                           as "Exhibit 1", to determine the Contingent Profit
                           Commission Rate Earned. Note: Final calculations
                           subject to rounding to the nearest 10th and
                           interpolation;

                  (4)      Multiply the Contingent Profit Commission Rate Earned
                           by earned premium for the contingent year to
                           determine the contingent profit (year) commission;


         b.       All calculations are on a calendar year basis;

         c.       An example of the above-stated calculation is attached hereto
                  as "Exhibit 2";

         b.       Payment shall be made 100% in cash, unless Agent notifies
                  Penn-America in writing that it desires payment in

         c.       For purposes of payment in PNG common stock, the stock shall

                  the contingent year. If the New York Stock Exchange is not

         f.       The contingent profit commission may be subject to income tax.
                  Agent should seek the advice of a personal tax advisor in this
                  regard;

5.       Qualifications: To qualify for a contingent profit commission under
         this Addendum, Agent recognizes that:

         f.       Agent cannot pledge, assign, sell or otherwise alienate this
                  Addendum without the prior written consent of an officer of
                  Penn-America. Any purported or attempted assignment of this
                  Addendum without such prior written consent shall not be
                  binding on Penn-America.

6.       Amendment and Termination:

                       breach of the Addendum or General Agency Agreement or
