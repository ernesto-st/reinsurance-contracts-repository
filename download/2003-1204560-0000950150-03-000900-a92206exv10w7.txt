                  SECTION 2.01. The Advances and the Letters of Credit. (a) The
Revolving Credit Advances. Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, to make advances (each a "REVOLVING CREDIT
ADVANCE") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the
period from the date hereof until the Termination Date in an amount for each
such Advance not to exceed such Lender's Unused Revolving Credit Commitment at
such time. Each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall consist of Revolving
Credit Advances made simultaneously by the Lenders ratably according to their
Revolving Credit Commitments. Within the limits of each Lender's Unused
Revolving Credit Commitment in effect from time to time and prior to the
Termination Date, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(a), prepay
pursuant to Section 2.06(a) and reborrow under this Section 2.01(a).

                  (b)      Letters of Credit. Each Issuing Bank severally
agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to issue (or cause
its Affiliate that is a commercial bank to issue on its behalf) letters of
credit in substantially the form of Exhibit I hereto, or such other form
required by the Issuing Banks in their sole discretion (the "LETTERS OF
CREDIT"), for the account of the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day
during the period from the date hereof until 60 days before the Termination Date
in an aggregate Available Amount (i) for all Letters of Credit not to exceed at
any time the Letter of Credit Facility at such time, (ii) for all Letters of
Credit issued by such Issuing Bank not to exceed such Issuing Bank's Letter of
Credit Commitment at such time, and (iii) for each such Letter of Credit not to
exceed the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders at such time. No
Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date (including all rights of the
Borrower or the beneficiary to require renewal) later than the earlier of 60
days before the Termination Date and (A) in the case of a Standby Letter of
Credit one year after the date of issuance thereof, but may by its terms be
renewable annually upon notice (a "Notice of Renewal") given to the Issuing Bank
that issued such Standby Letter of Credit and the Administrative Agent on or
prior to any date for notice of renewal set forth in such Letter of Credit but
in any event at least three Business Days prior to the date of the proposed
renewal of such Standby Letter of Credit and upon fulfillment of the applicable
conditions set forth in Article III unless such Issuing Bank has notified the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date for
notice of termination set forth in such Letter of Credit but in any event at
least 30 Business Days prior to the date of automatic renewal of its election
not to renew such Standby Letter of Credit (a "NOTICE OF TERMINATION") and (B)
in the case of a Trade Letter of Credit, 60 days after the date of issuance
thereof; provided, however, that the terms of each Standby Letter of Credit that
is automatically renewable annually shall (x) require the Issuing Bank that
issued such Standby Letter of Credit to give the beneficiary named in such
Standby Letter of Credit notice of any Notice of Termination, (y) permit such
beneficiary, upon receipt of such notice, to draw under such Standby Letter of
Credit prior to the date such Standby Letter of Credit otherwise would have been
automatically renewed and (z) not permit the expiration date (after giving
effect to any renewal) of such Standby Letter of Credit in any event to be
extended to a date later than 60 days before the Termination Date. If either a
Notice of Renewal is not given by the Borrower or a Notice of Termination is
given by the relevant Issuing Bank pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, such Standby Letter of Credit shall expire on the date on which it
otherwise would have been automatically renewed; provided, however, that even in
the absence of receipt of a Notice of Renewal the relevant Issuing Bank shall,
unless instructed to the contrary by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower,
deem that a Notice of Renewal had been timely delivered and in such case, a
Notice of Renewal shall be deemed to have been so delivered for all purposes
under this Agreement. Each Standby Letter of Credit shall contain a provision
authorizing the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit to deliver to the
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, a notice (a "DEFAULT TERMINATION NOTICE")
terminating such Letter of Credit and giving such beneficiary 15 days to draw
such Letter of Credit. Within the limits of the Letter of Credit Facility,

                  SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances. (a) Except as otherwise
provided in Section 2.03, each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not
later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the
date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, or not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on
the Business Day of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting
of Base Rate Advances, by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, which shall
give to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or telecopier. Each such
notice of a Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF BORROWING") shall be by telephone, confirmed
immediately in writing, or telex or telecopier, in substantially the form of
Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing,
(ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such
Borrowing and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each Lender shall,
before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing in the case
of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances and 1:00 P.M. (New York
City time) on the date of such Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting
of Base Rate Advances, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending
Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in
same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing in accordance
with the respective Commitments of such Lender and the other Lenders. After the
Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Administrative Agent will
make such funds available to the Borrower by crediting the Borrower's Account;
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall first make a portion of
such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of any Letter of Credit
Advances made by any Issuing Bank and by any other Lender and outstanding on the
date of such Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of
such date, available to such Issuing Bank and such other Lenders for repayment
of such Letter of Credit Advances.

                  (b)      Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for
the initial Borrowing hereunder or for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of
such Borrowing is less than $5,000,000 or if the obligation of the Lenders to
make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section
2.07(d)(ii), 2.09 or 2.10 and (ii) there may not be more than 10 separate
Borrowings outstanding at any time.

                  (c)      Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and
binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of
Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower
shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such
Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in
such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth
in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of
such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on
such date.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to (x) the date of any Borrowing consisting of
Eurodollar Rate Advances or (y) 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of
any Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the


                                       25

<PAGE>

Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such
Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay or
pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
and to pay interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid or paid to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at such time under Section 2.07 to Advances comprising such Borrowing
and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender
shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so
paid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for all
purposes.

                  (e)      The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be
made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing,
but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.03. Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under
Letters of Credit. (a) Request for Issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be
issued upon notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
fifth Business Day prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of
Credit, by the Borrower to any Issuing Bank, which shall give to the
Administrative Agent and each Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or
telecopier. Each such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "NOTICE OF
ISSUANCE") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex or
telecopier, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such issuance (which
shall be a Business Day), (ii) Available Amount of such Letter of Credit, (iii)
expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (iv) name and address of the
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (v) form of such Letter of Credit, and
shall be accompanied by such application and agreement for letter of credit as
such Issuing Bank may specify to the Borrower for use in connection with such
requested Letter of Credit (a "LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT"). If (y) the
requested form of such Letter of Credit is acceptable to such Issuing Bank in
its sole discretion and (z) it has not received notice of objection to such
issuance from the Required Lenders, such Issuing Bank will, upon fulfillment of
the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, make such Letter of Credit
available to the Borrower at its office referred to in Section 9.02 or as
otherwise agreed with the Borrower in connection with such issuance. In the
event and to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement
shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall
govern.

                  (b)      Letter of Credit Reports. Each Issuing Bank shall
furnish (i) to each Lender on the first Business Day of each month a written
report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued by
such Issuing Bank during the preceding month and drawings during such month
under all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and (ii) to the
Administrative Agent and each Lender on the first Business Day of each calendar
quarter a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate Available
Amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit issued by
such Issuing Bank.

                  (c)      Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by any Issuing
Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all
purposes of this Agreement the making by such Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit
Advance, which shall be a Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft. Upon
written demand by any Issuing Bank with an outstanding Letter of Credit Advance,
with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall
purchase from such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall sell and assign to
each such Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Letter of
Credit Advance as of the date of such purchase, by making available for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Administrative Agent's Account,
in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal
amount of such Letter of Credit Advance to be purchased by such Lender.


                                       26

<PAGE>

Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent shall transfer such
funds to such Issuing Bank. The Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and
assignment. Each Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding
Letter of Credit Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is
made by the Issuing Bank which made such Advance, provided that notice of such
demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such
Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if
notice of such demand is given after such time. Upon any such assignment by an
Issuing Bank to any Lender of a portion of a Letter of Credit Advance, such
Issuing Bank represents and warrants to such other Lender that such Issuing Bank
is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, free
and clear of any liens, but makes no other representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to such Letter of Credit Advance, the
Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not
have so made the amount of such Letter of Credit Advance available to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date of demand by such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid
to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the
account of such Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent such amount for the account of such Issuing Bank on any
Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a
Letter of Credit Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes
of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Letter of Credit
Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such
Business Day.

                  (d)      Failure to Make Letter of Credit Advances. The
failure of any Lender to make the Letter of Credit Advance to be made by it on
the date specified in Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation hereunder to make its Letter of Credit Advance on such date, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Letter of Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.

                  SECTION 2.04. Repayment of Advances. (a) Revolving Credit
Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
account of the Lenders on the Termination Date the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances then outstanding.

                  (b)      Letter of Credit Advances. (i) The Borrower shall
repay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Issuing Bank and each
other Lender that has made a Letter of Credit Advance on the same day on which
such Advance was made the outstanding principal amount of each Letter of Credit
Advance made by each of them.

                  (ii)     The Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement,
any Letter of Credit Agreement and any other agreement or instrument relating to
any Letter of Credit (and the obligations of each Lender to reimburse the
Issuing Bank with respect thereto) shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such
Letter of Credit Agreement and such other agreement or instrument under all
circumstances, including, without limitation, the following circumstances:

                  (A)      any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan
         Document, any Letter of Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any
         other agreement or instrument relating thereto (all of the foregoing
         being, collectively, the "L/C RELATED DOCUMENTS");

                  (B)      any change in the time, manner or place of payment
         of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations of the
         Borrower in respect of any L/C Related Document or any


                                       27

<PAGE>


         other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or
         any of the L/C Related Documents;

                  (C)      the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
         right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or
         any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for which any such
         beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Bank or
         any other Person, whether in connection with the transactions
         contemplated by the L/C Related Documents or any unrelated transaction;

                  (D)      any statement or any other document presented under a
         Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;

                  (E)      payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
         against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly
         comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

                  (F)      any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
         Collateral or other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver
         of or consent to departure from the Guaranties or any other guarantee,
         for all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower in respect of the L/C
         Related Documents; or

                  (G)      any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including, without
         limitation, any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a
         defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or a guarantor.

                  SECTION 2.05. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a)
Optional. The Borrower may, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, terminate in whole or reduce in part the unused portions
of the Letter of Credit Facility and the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments;
provided, however, that each partial reduction of a Facility (i) shall be in an
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof and (ii) shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
their Commitments with respect to such Facility.

                  (b)      Mandatory. The Letter of Credit Facility shall be
permanently reduced from time to time on the date of each reduction in the
Revolving Credit Facility by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the
Letter of Credit Facility exceeds the Revolving Credit Facility after giving
effect to such reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility.

                  SECTION 2.06. Prepayments. (a) Optional. The Borrower may,
upon same day notice in the case of Base Rate Advances and two Business Days'
notice in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case to the
Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of
the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Advances comprising part of the
same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to
the date of such prepayment on the aggregate principal amount prepaid; provided,
however, that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or,
if less, the amount of the Advances outstanding and (ii) if any prepayment of a
Eurodollar Rate Advance is made on a date other than the last day of an Interest
Period for such Advance, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant
to Section 9.04(c).

                  (b)      Mandatory. (i) The Borrower shall, on each Business
Day, prepay an aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances
comprising part of the same Borrowings and the


                                       28

<PAGE>

Letter of Credit Advances and deposit an amount in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account in an amount equal to the amount by which (A) the sum of the aggregate
principal amount of (1) the Revolving Credit Advances then outstanding and (2)
the Letter of Credit Advances then outstanding plus the aggregate Available
Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds (B) the lesser of the
Revolving Credit Facility and the Loan Value on such Business Day.

                  (ii)     The Borrower shall, on each Business Day, pay to the
Administrative Agent for deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account an amount
sufficient to cause the aggregate amount on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account to equal the amount by which the aggregate Available Amount of all
Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds the Letter of Credit Facility on such
Business Day.

                  (iii)    Prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility made
pursuant to clause (i) above shall be first applied to prepay Letter of Credit
Advances then outstanding until such Advances are paid in full, second applied
to prepay Revolving Credit Advances then outstanding comprising part of the same
Borrowings until such Advances are paid in full and third deposited in the L/C
Cash Collateral Account to cash collateralize 100% of the Available Amount of
the Letters of Credit then outstanding. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit
for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, such funds
shall be applied to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank or Lenders, as
applicable.

                  (iv)     All prepayments under this subsection (b) shall be
made together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the
principal amount prepaid.

                  SECTION 2.07. Interest. (a) Scheduled Interest. The Borrower

         Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to
         the sum of (A) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (B) the
         Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable in arrears
         quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December
         during such periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be
         Converted or paid in full.

                  (ii)     Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such
         Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all
         times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (A)

         the Applicable Margin in effect on the first day of such Interest
         Period, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and,
         if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on
         each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months
         from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such
         Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

                  (b)      Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Default of the type described in Section 6.01 (a) or (i) or, at

Lender, payable in arrears on the dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum

(a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan Documents
that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such
amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall
be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per
annum above the rate per annum required to be paid, in the case of interest, on

pursuant to clause (a)(i) above.

                  (c)      Notice of Interest Period and Interest Rate. Promptly
after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(a), a notice of
Conversion pursuant to Section 2.09 or a notice of selection of an Interest
Period pursuant to the terms of the definition of "Interest Period", the
Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Borrower and each Lender of the
applicable Interest Period and the applicable interest rate determined by the
Administrative Agent for purposes of clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, and the
applicable rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of
determining the applicable interest rate under clause (a)(ii) above.

                  (d)      Interest Rate Determination. (i) Each Reference Bank
agrees to furnish to the Administrative Agent timely information for the purpose
of determining each Eurodollar Rate. If either of the Reference Banks shall not
furnish such timely information to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of
determining any such interest rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine
such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the other
Reference Bank.

                  (ii)     If Telerate Page 3750 is unavailable and neither
Reference Bank is able to furnish timely information to the Administrative Agent
for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Eurodollar Rate Advances,

                  (A)      the Administrative Agent shall forthwith notify the
         Borrower and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined
         for such Eurodollar Rate Advances,

                  (B)      each such Advance will automatically, on the last day
         of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
         Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue
         as a Base Rate Advance), and

                  (C)      the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert
         Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the
         Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
         circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  SECTION 2.08. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders a facility fee (the
"FACILITY FEE"), from the date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender and
from the effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to
which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination
Date, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing June 30,2003, and on the Termination Date.
The Facility Fee payable in respect of each Lender shall be calculated for each
quarterly period for which the Facility Fee is payable on the average daily
Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender during such period at a rate equal to
0.20% per annum. If on the last day of any fiscal quarter the Borrower shall not
maintain a Debt Rating established by S&P and Moody's of at least BBB-and Baa3,
respectively, the Facility Fee for such fiscal quarter shall be zero.

                  (b)      Unused Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders an unused commitment fee
(the "UNUSED FEE"), from the date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender and
from the effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to
which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination
Date, payable in arrears on the date of the initial Borrowing hereunder, and
thereafter quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and
December, commencing June 30,2003, and on the Termination Date. The Unused Fee
payable for the account of each Lender shall be calculated for each period for
which the Unused Fee is payable on the average daily Unused Revolving Credit
Commitment of such Lender during such period at


                                       30

<PAGE>

a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Percentage on the first day of such
period. If on the last day of any fiscal quarter the Borrower shall maintain a
Debt Rating established by S&P and Moody's of at least BBS- and Baa3,
respectively, the Unused Fee shall be zero for such fiscal quarter.

                  (c)      Letter of Credit Fees, Etc, (i) The Borrower shall
pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commission,

daily aggregate Available Amount during such quarter of all Letters of Credit
outstanding from time to time at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable
Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances in effect from time to time.

                  (ii)     The Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank, for its
own account, (A) a fronting fee for each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank in an amount equal to 0.125% of the Available Amount of such Letter of
Credit on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, payable on such date
and (B) such other commissions, issuance fees, transfer fees and other fees and

Credit as the Borrower and such Issuing Bank shall agree.

                  (d)      Agents' Fees. The Borrower shall pay to each Agent
for its own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between the
Borrower and such Agent.

                  SECTION 2.09. Conversion of Advances. (a) Optional. The
Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent
not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior
to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections
2.07 and 2.10, Convert all or any portion of the Advances of one Type comprising
the same Borrowing into Advances of the other Type; provided, however, that any
Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made
only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances,
any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in
an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in Section 2.02(b), no
Conversion of any Advances shall result in more separate Borrowings than
permitted under Section 2.02(b) and each Conversion of Advances comprising part
of the same Borrowing under any Facility shall be made ratably among the Lenders
in accordance with their Commitments under such Facility. Each such notice of
Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date
of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted and (iii) if such
Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the initial
Interest Period for such Advances, Each notice of Conversion shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

                  (b)      Mandatory. (i) On the date on which the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing
shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than
$5,000,000, such Advances shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                  (ii)     If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of
any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders,
whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day
of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance.

                  (iii)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, (y) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance and (z) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances
into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs. Etc, (a) If, due to either (i)
the introduction after the date hereof of or any change after the date hereof in
or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with
any guideline or request after the date hereof from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make or of making,
funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances or of agreeing to issue or of
issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of Credit or of agreeing to
make or of making or maintaining Letter of Credit Advances (excluding, for
purposes of this Section 2.10, any such increased costs resulting from (y) Taxes
or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.12 shall govern) and (z) changes in the
basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United
States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such
Lender Party is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof), then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by
such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party for such increased cost;
provided, however, that a Lender Party claiming additional amounts under this
Section 2.10(a) agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different
Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a designation would avoid the
need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost that may thereafter
accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party. A certificate as to the amount
of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender Party, shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (b)      If any Lender Party determines that compliance with
any law or regulation after the date hereof or any guideline or request after
the date hereof from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether
or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Lender Party or any corporation
controlling such Lender Party and that the amount of such capital is increased
by or based upon the existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or to
issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of
such type or the issuance or maintenance of or participation in the Letters of
Credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender
Party or such corporation (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative
Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Lender Party, from time to time as specified by such Lender Party,
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party in the light of
such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender Party reasonably determines
such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender Party's
commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder or
to the issuance or maintenance of or participation in any Letters of Credit. A
certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower by such Lender Party
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (c)      If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for
any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to
such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Eurodollar Rate Advances
for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the
Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor,
Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make,
or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower that such Lenders have
determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of
any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank


                                       32

<PAGE>

or other governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender
or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender
to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) each Eurodollar Rate
Advance will automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate Advance
and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into,
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall
notify the Borrower that such Lender has determined that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that, before making
any such demand, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a
different Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a designation would
allow such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to continue to perform its
obligations to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Advances and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower
shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right
of counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.13), not
later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars
to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account in same day
funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent after such time
being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The
Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause like funds to be distributed
(i) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of principal, interest,
commitment fees or any other Obligation then payable hereunder and under the
Notes to more than one Lender Party, to such Lender Parties for the account of
their respective Applicable Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the
amounts of such respective Obligations then payable to such Lender Parties and
(ii) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of any Obligation then
payable hereunder to one Lender Party, to such Lender Party for the account of
its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and
recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to
Section 9.07(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and
Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under
the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender Party
assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall
make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such
effective date directly between themselves.

                  (b)      The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender Party and
each of its Affiliates, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender Party
is not made when due hereunder or, in the case of a Lender, under the Note held
by such Lender, to charge from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender Party any
amount so due.

                  (c)      All computations of interest based on the Base Rate
shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366
days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the
Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees and Letter of Credit
commissions shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of
360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day
but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest,
fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent
of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (d)      Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes
shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall
be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or


                                       33

<PAGE>

commitment fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension
would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to
be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the
next preceding Business Day.

                  (e)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any
Lender Party hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender Party
on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender Party. If
and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to
the Administrative Agent, each such Lender Party shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                  (f)      Whenever any payment received by the Administrative
Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to
pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Agents and the Lender Parties
under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date,
such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the
Agents and the Lender Parties in the following order of priority:

                  (i)      first, to the payment of all of the fees,
         indemnification payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable
         to the Agents (solely in their respective capacities as Agents) under
         or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on such
         date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
         fees, indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Agents
         on such date;

                  (ii)     second, to the payment of all of the fees,
         indemnification payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable
         to the Issuing Banks (solely in their respective capacities as such)
         under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on
         such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all
         such fees, indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the
         Issuing Banks on such date;

                  (iii)    third, to the payment of all of the indemnification
         payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable to the Lenders
         under Section 9.04, Section 22 of the Security Agreements and any
         similar section of any of the other Loan Documents on such date,
         ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
         indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Lenders on
         such date;

                  (iv)     fourth, to the payment of all of the amounts that are
         due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties
         under Sections 2.10 and 2.12 on such date, ratably based upon the
         respective aggregate amounts thereof owing to the Administrative Agent
         and the Lender Parties on such date;

                  (v)      fifth, to the payment of all of the fees that are due
         and payable to the Lenders under Section 2.08(a) and (b) on such date,
         ratably based upon the respective aggregate Commitments of the Lenders
         under the Facilities on such date;

                  (vi)     sixth, to the payment of all of the accrued and
         unpaid interest on the Obligations of the Borrower under or in respect
         of the Loan Documents that is due and payable to the Administrative
         Agent and the Lender Parties under Section 2.07(b) on such date,
         ratably based


                                       34

<PAGE>

         upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such interest owing to the
         Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date;

                  (vii)    seventh, to the payment of all of the accrued and
         unpaid interest on the Advances that is due and payable to the
         Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties under Section 2.07(a) on
         such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all
         such interest owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties
         on such date;

                  (viii)   eighth, to the payment of the principal amount of all
         of the outstanding Advances and any reimbursement obligations that are
         due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on
         such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all
         such principal and reimbursement obligations owing to the
         Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date, and to
         deposit into the L/C Cash Collateral Account any contingent
         reimbursement obligations in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit
         to the extent required by Section 6.02; and

                  (ix)     ninth, to the payment of all other Obligations of the
         Loan Parties owing under or in respect of the Loan Documents that are
         due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
         Parties on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate
         amounts of all such Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and
         the other Secured Parties on such date.

                  SECTION 2.12. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower
hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11,
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender Party and the
Administrative Agent, taxes that are imposed on its overall net income by the
United States and taxes that are imposed on its overall net income (and
franchise or other similar taxes imposed in lieu thereof) by the state or
foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender Party or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is organized or any political
subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender Parry, taxes that are
imposed on its overall net income (and franchise or other similar taxes imposed
in lieu thereof) by the state or foreign jurisdiction of such Lender Party's
Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes being
hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any
Note to any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable by the
Borrower shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) such Lender Party
or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower
shall make all such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance
with applicable law.

                  (b)      In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or
future stamp, documentary, excise, property, intangible, mortgage recording or
similar taxes, charges or levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or
under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performance
under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document
(hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES"). Each Lender Party represents as of
the date hereof that, to the best of its knowledge without having conducted any
investigation, except for any Other Taxes that may be imposed under the federal,
state or local laws of the United States (or any political subdivision thereof),
it is not aware of the imposition of any Other Taxes with respect to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

                  (c)      The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender Party and
the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of
Taxes and Other Taxes, and for the full amount of taxes of any kind imposed by
any jurisdiction (taking into account any available credits, as determined in
the sole discretion of the Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case
may be), arising from the imposition of the underlying Taxes or Other Taxes) on
amounts payable under this Section 2. 12, imposed on or paid by such Lender
Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from
the date such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
makes written demand therefor, provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be
obligated to make payment to any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as
the case may be) pursuant to this Section 2.12 in respect of penalties, interest
and other liabilities attributable to any Taxes or Other Taxes, if such
penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender Party or the Administrative
Agent.

                  (d)      Within 30 days after the date of any payment of
Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address
referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing such payment or, if such receipts are not obtainable, other evidence
of such payments by the Borrower reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.

                  (e)      Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States shall, on or prior to the date of its
execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender
Party, and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender Party, and from time to
time thereafter as requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long
thereafter as such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), provide each of
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal Revenue
Service forms W8-ECI or W8-BEN, as appropriate, or any successor or other form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender Party is
exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes. If the forms provided by a
Lender Party at the time such Lender Party first becomes a parry to this
Agreement indicate a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of
zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes
unless and until such Lender Party provides the appropriate forms certifying
that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only
shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such forms;
provided, however, that if, at the effective date of the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party becomes a parry to this Agreement,
the Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of this
Section 2.12 in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to
interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include
(in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other
amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any,
applicable with respect to the Lender Party assignee on such date. If any form
or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of
information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and
information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W8-ECI
or W8-BEN, that the applicable Lender Party reasonably considers to be
confidential, such Lender Party shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and
shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential
information.

                  (f)      For any period with respect to which a Lender Party
has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form described in
subsection (e) above (other than if such failure is due to a change in law
occurring after the date on which a form originally was required to be provided
or if such form otherwise is not required under subsection (e) above), such
Lender Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under subsection (a) or
(c) of this Section 2.12 with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by
reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a Lender Party become
subject to


                                       36

<PAGE>

Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower
shall take such steps as such Lender Party shall reasonably request to assist
such Lender Party to recover such Taxes.

                  (g)      Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 agrees to use reasonable efforts
(consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
change the jurisdiction of its Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a
change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional
amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of
such Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party.

                  (h)      If any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent
receives a refund of Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Borrower or for which the
Borrower has indemnified any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.12, then such Lender Party or the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall pay such amount, net of any expenses
incurred by such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower
within 30 days of the receipt of such Taxes or Other Taxes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Borrower shall not be entitled to review the tax records or
financial information of any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent and (ii)
neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender Party shall have any obligation
to pursue (and no Loan Party shall have any right to assert) any refund of Taxes
or Other Taxes that may be paid by the Borrower.

                  SECTION 2.13. Sharing of Payments. Etc. If any Lender Party
shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through
the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an
assignment pursuant to Section 9.07) (a) on account of Obligations due and
payable to such Lender Party hereunder and under the Notes at such time in
excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party at such time to (ii) the
aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties
hereunder and under the Notes at such time) of payments on account of the
Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes
at such time obtained by all the Lender Parties at such time or (b) on account
of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender Party hereunder
and under the Notes at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to
the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Lender Party
at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due
and payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time)
of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all
Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time obtained by all of the
Lender Parties at such time, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the
other Lender Parties such interests or participating interests in the
Obligations due and payable or owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender Party to share the excess payment
ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such
purchase from each other Lender Party shall be rescinded and such other Lender
Party shall repay to the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the
extent of such Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)
the purchase price paid to such Lender Party to (ii) the aggregate purchase
price paid to all Lender Parties) of such recovery together with an amount equal
to such Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the
amount of such other Lender Party's required repayment to (ii) the total amount
so recovered from the purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount
paid or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so
recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so purchasing an interest
or participating interest from another Lender Party pursuant to this Section
2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of
payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such interest or
participating interest, as the case may be, as fully as if such Lender Party
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such interest or
participating interest, as the case may be.

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 2.14. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances
and issuances of Letters of Credit shall be available (and the Borrower agrees
that it shall use such proceeds and Letters of Credit) solely for the
acquisition and development of Real Property, to refinance certain Existing
Debt, and the general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

                  SECTION 2.15. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender Party shall
maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing
the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender Party resulting from each
Advance owing to such Lender Party from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender Party from time to time
hereunder. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender Party to the
Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) to the effect
that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or
appropriate in order for such Lender Party to evidence (whether for purposes of
pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such
Lender Party, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender
Party, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a Note, in substantially the
form of Exhibit A hereto, payable to the order of such Lender Party in a
principal amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender Party.
All references to Notes in the Loan Documents shall mean Notes, if any, to the
extent issued hereunder.

                  (b)      The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 9.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary
account for each Lender Party, in which accounts (taken together) shall be
recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of
Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender Party
hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender Party's share thereof.

                  (c)      Entries made in good faith by the Administrative
Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender Party
in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima
facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each
Lender Party and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender Party,
under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure
of the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party to make an entry, or any
finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 2.16. Extension of Termination Date. (a) At least 30
days but not more than 60 days prior to the Termination Date, the Borrower, by
written notice to the Administrative Agent, may request, with respect to the
Revolving Credit Commitments and the Letter of Credit Commitments then
outstanding, a single one-year extension of the Termination Date. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request and the
Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the Termination
Date (the "EXTENSION DATE"), be extended for an additional one year period,
provided that (i) the Collateral Agent shall have received no later than 10 days
prior to the Extension Date a recent Appraisal of each Eligible Real Estate
Asset (it being understood and agreed that any Appraisals previously delivered
to the Collateral Agent in satisfaction of a request made pursuant to Section
5.01(k)(iii) shall satisfy the requirements of this subsection (i)) and (ii) on
the Extension Date, the following statements shall be true in all material
respects and the Administrative Agent shall have received for the account of
each Lender Party a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of the
Borrower, dated the Extension Date, stating that: (x) the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.01 are true and correct on and as of the
Extension Date, and (y) no Default has occurred and is continuing or would
result from such extension. In the event that an extension is effected pursuant
to this


                                       38

<PAGE>

Section 2.16, the aggregate principal amount of all Advances shall be repaid in
full ratably to the Lenders on the Termination Date as so extended. As of the
Extension Date, any and all references in this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or
any of the other Loan Documents to the 'Termination Date" shall refer to the
Termination Date as so extended.

                  (b)      The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Lenders a Facility extension fee in an amount equal to
0.25% of the total Revolving Credit Commitments then outstanding, payable on the
Extension Date.

                                   ARTICLE III
            CONDITIONS OF LENDING AND ISSUANCES OF LETTERS OF CREDIT

                  SECTION 3.01. Conditions Precedent to Initial Extension of
Credit. The obligation of each Lender to make an Advance or of any Issuing Bank
to issue a Letter of Credit on the occasion of the Initial Extension of Credit
hereunder is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent
before or concurrently with the Initial Extension of Credit:

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent shall have received on or
         before the day of the Initial Extension of Credit the following, each
         dated such day (unless otherwise specified), in form and substance
         satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (unless otherwise specified)
         and (except for the Notes) in sufficient copies for each Lender Party:

                           (i)      A Note payable to the order of each Lender
                  that has requested a Note prior to the Effective Date.

                           (ii)     A security agreement in substantially the
                  form of (x) Exhibit F-1 hereto, duly executed by each Loan

                  F-2 hereto, duly executed by Maguire Properties Services, Inc.
                  (such security agreements, together with each other security
                  agreement and security agreement supplement delivered pursuant
                  to Section 5.01(j), in each case as amended, being the

                           of the Initial Extension of Credit under the Uniform
                           Commercial Code of all jurisdictions that the
                           Collateral Agent may deem necessary or desirable in

         proceeding affecting any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any
         general partner or managing member (if any) of any Loan Party,

         enforceability of any Loan Document or the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby, and there has been no adverse change
         in the status, or financial effect on any Loan Party or any of its
         Subsidiaries or any general partner or managing member (if any) of any

         that no Excluded Subsidiary shall be required to preserve its existence
         or be prevented from winding-up or dissolving, if, in either case, (i)
         the non-preservation, winding-up or dissolution of such Excluded

         their Affiliates or with any Excluded Subsidiary on terms that are fair
         and reasonable and no less favorable to such Loan Party or such
         Subsidiary than it would obtain in a comparable arm's-length
         transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

                  (j) Covenant to Guarantee Obligations and Give Security. (i)
         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default of the

         Advance when the same shall become due and payable or (ii) the Borrower
         shall fail to pay any interest on any Advance, or any Loan Party shall
         fail to make any other payment under any Loan Document, in each case
         under this clause (ii) within three Business Days after the same
         becomes due and payable; or

         any of its officers or the officers of its general partner or managing
         member, as applicable) under or in connection with any Loan Document
         shall prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made;
         or

                  (c) the Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any term,
         covenant or agreement contained in Section 2.14, 5.01 (d), (e), (f),
         (i), (j), (o), (p), (q) or (r), 5.02, 5.03 or 5.04; or

         term, covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document on its part
         to be performed or observed if such failure shall remain unremedied for
         15 days after the earlier of the date on which (i) a Responsible

         shall have been given to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent or
         any Lender Party; or

                  (e) any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall fail to

         defeased, or an offer to prepay, redeem, purchase or defease such
         Material Debt shall be required to be made, in each case prior to the
         stated maturity thereof; or

                  (f) any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall generally
         not pay its debts as such debts become due, or shall admit in writing
         its inability to pay its debts generally, or shall make a general
         assignment for the benefit of creditors; or any proceeding shall be
         instituted by or against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries
         seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking
         liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
         protection, relief, or composition of it or its debts under any law
         relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of
         debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment
         of a receiver, trustee, or other similar official for it or for any
         substantial part of its property and, in the case of any such
         proceeding instituted against it (but not instituted by it) that is
         being diligently contested

         unstayed for a period of 30 days or any of the actions sought in such
         proceeding (including, without limitation, the entry of an order for
         relief against, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or
         other similar official for, it or any substantial part of its property)
         shall occur; or any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall take
         any corporate action to authorize any of the actions set forth above in
         this subsection (f); or

                  (g) any judgments or orders, either individually or in the
         aggregate, for the payment of money in excess of $10,000,000 shall be
         rendered against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries and either
         (i) enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by any creditor
         upon such judgment or order or (ii) there shall be any period of 10
         consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or
         order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in
         effect; or

         against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries that could have a
         Material Adverse Effect, and there shall be any period of 10

         pursuant to Section 3.01 or 5.01(j) shall for any reason cease to be
         valid and binding on or enforceable against any Loan Party party to it,
         or any such Loan Party shall so state in writing; or

                  (j) any Collateral Document or financing statement after
         delivery thereof pursuant to Section 3.01 or 5.01(j) shall for any
         reason (other than pursuant to the terms thereof) cease to create a
         valid and perfected first priority lien on and security interest in the
         Collateral purported to be covered thereby; or

                  (k) a Change of Control shall occur; or

                  (l) any ERISA Event shall have occurred with respect to a Plan
         and the sum (determined as of the date of occurrence of such ERISA
         Event) of the Insufficiency of such Plan and the Insufficiency of any
         and all other Plans with respect to which an ERISA Event shall have
         occurred and then exist (or the liability of the Loan Parties and the
         ERISA Affiliates related to such ERISA Event) exceeds $10,000,000; or

                  (m) any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that it has incurred
         Withdrawal Liability to such Multiemployer Plan in an amount that, when
         aggregated with all other amounts required to be paid to Multiemployer
         Plans by the Loan Parties and the ERISA Affiliates as Withdrawal
         Liability (determined as of the date of such notification), exceeds
         $10,000,000 or requires payments exceeding $2,000,000 per annum; or

                  (n) any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer
         Plan is in reorganization or is being terminated, within the meaning of
         Title IV of ERISA, and as a result of such reorganization or
         termination the aggregate annual contributions of the Loan Parties and
         the ERISA Affiliates to all Multiemployer Plans that are then in
         reorganization or being terminated have been or will be increased over
         the amounts contributed to such Multiemployer Plans for the plan years
         of such Multiemployer Plans immediately preceding the plan year in
         which such reorganization or termination occurs by an amount exceeding
         $2,000,000;


                                       64

then, and in any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall at the request,
or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrower,
declare the Commitments of each Lender Party and the obligation of each Lender
Party to make Advances (other than Letter of Credit Advances by an Issuing Bank
or a Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c)) and of each Issuing Bank to issue
Letters of Credit to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith
terminate, and (ii) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the
Required Lenders, (A) by notice to the Borrower, declare the Notes, all interest
thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Notes, all such
interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, (B) by notice to each party
required under the terms of any agreement in support of which a Letter of Credit
is issued, request that all Obligations under such agreement be declared to be
due and payable and (C) by notice to each Issuing Bank, direct such Issuing Bank
to deliver a Default Termination Notice to the beneficiary of each Letter of
Credit issued by it, and each Issuing Bank shall deliver such Default
Termination Notices; provided, however, that in the event of an actual or deemed
entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under any Bankruptcy
Law, (y) the Commitments of each Lender Party and the obligation of each Lender
Party to make Advances (other than Letter of Credit Advances by an Issuing Bank
or a Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c)) and of each Issuing Bank to issue
Letters of Credit shall automatically be terminated and (z) the Notes, all such
interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and be due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

                  SECTION 6.02. Actions in Respect of the Letters of Credit upon
Default. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders,
irrespective of whether it is taking any of the actions described in Section
6.01 or otherwise, make demand upon the Borrower to, and forthwith upon such
demand the Borrower will, pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Lender Parties in same day funds at the Administrative Agent's office designated
in such demand, for deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal
to the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding. If
at any time the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank determines that any
funds held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account are subject to any right or claim
of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties with
respect to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents, or that
the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of
all Letters of Credit, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the
Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be
deposited and held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the
excess of (a) such aggregate Available Amount over (b) the total amount of
funds, if any, then held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account that the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines to be free and clear of any
such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds
are on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, such funds shall be applied
to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank or Lenders, as applicable, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                    GUARANTY

                  SECTION 7.01. Guaranty; Limitation of Liability. (a) Each
Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the
punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a
required prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all Obligations
of the Borrower and each other Loan Party now or hereafter existing under or in
respect of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, any extensions,
modifications, substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the
foregoing Obligations), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and
whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of
action, costs, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations being the "GUARANTEED
OBLIGATIONS"), and agrees to pay


                                       65

<PAGE>

any and all expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of
counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in
enforcing any rights under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor's liability shall
extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and
would be owed by any other Loan Party to any Secured Party under or in respect
of the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not
allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding involving such other Loan Party.

                  (b) Each Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and each other
Lender Party and, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Guaranty, each other
Secured Party, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that
this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform
Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar
foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the
Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention,
the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent, the other Lenders Parties and, by
their acceptance of the benefits of this Guaranty, the other Secured Parties
hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor under this
Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in
the Obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

                  (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
agrees that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to any Secured
Party under this Guaranty or any other guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to each other Guarantor and
each other guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the Secured
Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 7.02. Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees
that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, regardless of any law,
regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any
of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured
Party with respect thereto. The Obligations of each Guarantor under or in
respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
other Obligations of any other Loan Party under or in respect of this Agreement
or the other the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought
and prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of
whether any action is brought against the Borrower or any other Loan Party or
whether the Borrower or any other Loan Party is joined in any such action or
actions. The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be
irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor
hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in
any way relating to, any or all of the following:

                  (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan
         Document or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
         in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
         other Obligations of any other Loan Party under or in respect of the
         Loan Documents, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to
         departure from any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any
         increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of
         additional credit to the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their
         Subsidiaries or otherwise;


                                       66

<PAGE>

                  (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any
         collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of, or
         consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations;

                  (d) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds
         thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of
         sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of any Loan Party under
         the Loan Documents or any other assets of any Loan Party or any of its
         Subsidiaries;

                  (e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
         structure or existence of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;

                  (f) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any other
         Secured Party to disclose to any Loan Party any information relating to
         the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations,
         performance, properties or prospects of any other Loan Party now or
         hereafter known to the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party
         (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Administrative
         Agent and each other Secured Party to disclose such information);

                  (g) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this
         Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Guaranty Supplement (as
         hereinafter defined) or any other guaranty or agreement or the release
         or reduction of liability of any Guarantor or other guarantor or surety
         with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or

                  (h) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any
         statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any
         representation by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party
         that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
         of, any Loan Party or any other guarantor or surety.

This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must otherwise be returned by any Secured Party or any other Person upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or any other Loan Party
or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

                  SECTION 7.03. Waivers and Acknowledgments. (a) Each Guarantor
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of
acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance,
default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to
any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party protect, secure, perfect or
insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any
action against any Loan Party or any other Person or any collateral.

                  (b) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is
continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing
now or in the future.

                  (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an
election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party that
in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights
of such Guarantor or other rights of such Guarantor to proceed against any of
the other Loan Parties, any other guarantor or any


                                       67

<PAGE>

other Person or any collateral and (ii) any defense based on any right of
set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the Obligations of such
Guarantor hereunder.

                  (d) Each Guarantor acknowledges that the Administrative Agent
may, without notice to or demand upon such Guarantor and without affecting the
liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, foreclose under any mortgage by
nonjudicial sale, and each Guarantor hereby waives any defense to the recovery
by the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties against such Guarantor
of any deficiency after such nonjudicial sale and any defense or benefits that
may be afforded by Sections 580a and 580d of the California Code of Civil
Procedure or any statute or law in any other jurisdiction having similar effect.
Each Guarantor irrevocably waives any right (including without limitation any
such right arising under California Civil Code Section 2815) to revoke this
Guaranty as to future transactions giving rise to any Guaranteed Obligations.

                  (e) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured
Party to disclose to such Guarantor any matter, fact or thing relating to the
business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance,
properties or prospects of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their
Subsidiaries now or hereafter known by the Administrative Agent or such other
Secured Party.

                  (f) Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and that the waivers
set forth in Section 7.02 and this Section 7.03 are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.

                  SECTION 7.04. Subrogation. Each Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may
now have or hereafter acquire against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any
other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of such Guarantor's Obligations under or in respect of this
Guaranty, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution
or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any
Secured Party against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other insider
guarantor or any collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises
in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without
limitation, the right to take or receive from the Borrower, any other Loan Party
or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other
property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of
such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations
and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full
in cash, all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been terminated and the
Commitments shall have expired or been terminated. If any amount shall be paid
to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time
prior to the latest of (a) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed
Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) the
Termination Date and (c) the latest date of expiration or termination of all
Letters of Credit, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, shall be segregated from other property and
funds of such Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the
Administrative Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary
endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed
Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured
or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. If (i) any
Guarantor shall make payment to any Secured Party of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other
amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, (iii)
the Termination Date shall have occurred and (iv) all Letters of Credit shall
have expired or been terminated, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
Parties will, at such Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to
such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without
representation or warranty, necessary to


                                       68

evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the
Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by such Guarantor
pursuant to this Guaranty.

                  SECTION 7.05. Guaranty Supplements. Upon the execution and
delivery by any Person of a Guaranty Supplement, (i) such Person shall be
referred to as an "ADDITIONAL GUARANTOR" and shall become and be a Guarantor
hereunder, and each reference in this Agreement to a "Guarantor" or a "Loan
Party" shall also mean and be a reference to such Additional Guarantor, and each
reference in any other Loan Document to a "Guarantor" shall also mean and be a
reference to such Additional Guarantor, and (ii) each reference herein to "this
Agreement", "this Guaranty", "hereunder", "hereof or words of like import
referring to this Agreement and this Guaranty, and each reference in any other
Loan Document to the "Loan Agreement", "Guaranty", "thereunder", "thereof or
words of like import referring to this Agreement and this Guaranty, shall mean
and be a reference to this Agreement and this Guaranty as supplemented by such
Guaranty Supplement.

                  SECTION 7.06. Indemnification by Guarantors. (a) Without
limitation on any other Obligations of any Guarantor or remedies of the
Administrative Agent or the Secured Parties under this Agreement, this Guaranty
or the other Loan Documents, each Guarantor shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent, each Secured Party and each of their Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against, and shall pay on demand, any and all
claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or
asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party in connection with or as a
result of any failure of any Guaranteed Obligations to be the legal, valid and
binding obligations of any Loan Party enforceable against such Loan Party in
accordance with their terms.

                  (b)      Each Guarantor hereby also agrees that none of the
Indemnified Parties shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in
contract, tort or otherwise) to any of the Guarantors or any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
advisors, and each Guarantor hereby agrees not to assert any claim against any
Indemnified Party on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the
Facilities, the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances or the
Letters of Credit, the Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 7.07. Subordination. (a) Each Guarantor hereby
subordinates any and all debts, liabilities and other Obligations owed to such
Guarantor by each other Loan Party (the "SUBORDINATED OBLIGATIONS") to the
Guaranteed Obligations to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in
this Section 7.07.

                  (b)      Prohibited Payments, Etc. Except during the
continuance of a Default (including the commencement and continuation of any
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party), each
Guarantor may receive regularly scheduled payments from any other Loan Party on
account of the Subordinated Obligations. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Default (including the commencement and continuation of any
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party), however,
unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, no Guarantor shall demand,
accept or take any action to collect any payment on account of the Subordinated
Obligations.

                  (c)      Prior Payment of Guaranteed Obligations. In any
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party, each
Guarantor agrees that the Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive payment
in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations (including all interest and
expenses accruing after the commencement of a proceeding under any Bankruptcy
Law, whether or not


                                       69

<PAGE>

constituting an allowed claim in such proceeding ("POST PETITION INTEREST"))
before such Guarantor receives payment of any Subordinated Obligations.

                  (d)      Turn-Over. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Default (including the commencement and continuation of any
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party), each
Guarantor shall, if the Administrative Agent so requests, collect, enforce and
receive payments on account of the Subordinated Obligations as trustee for the
Secured Parties and deliver such payments to the Administrative Agent on account
of the Guaranteed Obligations (including all Post Petition Interest), together
with any necessary endorsements or other instruments of transfer, but without
reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under the
other provisions of this Guaranty.

                  (e)      Administrative Agent Authorization. After the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Default (including the commencement
and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any
other Loan Party), the Administrative Agent is authorized and empowered (but
without any obligation to so do), in its discretion, (i) in the name of each
Guarantor, to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of,
Subordinated Obligations and to apply any amounts received thereon to the
Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post Petition Interest), and (ii)
to require each Guarantor (A) to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in
respect of, Subordinated Obligations and (B) to pay any amounts received on such
obligations to the Administrative Agent for application to the Guaranteed
Obligations (including any and all Post Petition Interest).

                  SECTION 7.08. Continuing Guaranty. This Guaranty is a
continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the
latest of (i) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all
other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (ii) the Termination Date and (iii)
the latest date of expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (b) be
binding upon the Guarantors, their successors and assigns and (c) inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
Parties and their successors, transferees and assigns.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   THE AGENTS

                  SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender Party (in
its capacities as a Lender and as an Issuing Bank (if applicable) and on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates as potential Hedge Banks) hereby appoints and
authorizes each Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers and discretion under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as
are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such
powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters
not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation,
enforcement or collection of the Notes), no Agent shall be required to exercise
any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain
from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from
acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions
shall be binding upon all Lender Parties and all holders of Notes; provided,
however, that no Agent shall be required to take any action that exposes such
Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable
law. Each Agent agrees to give to each Lender Party prompt notice of each notice
given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document, no Person
identified as a syndication agent, documentation agent, senior manager, lead
arranger or book running manager, in such Person's capacity as such, shall have
any obligations or duties to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party under any of such Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 8.02. Agents' Reliance, Etc. Neither any Agent nor any
of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Loan
Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each Agent: (a) in the
case of the Administrative Agent, may treat the payee of any Note as the holder
thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and
Acceptance entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such Note, as
assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, or, in the case of any other
Agent, such Agent has received notice from the Administrative Agent that it has
received and accepted such Assignment and Acceptance, in each case as provided
in Section 9.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for any
Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender Party and shall not be
responsible to any Lender Party for any statements, warranties or
representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with the Loan
Documents; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance, observance or satisfaction of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of any Loan Document on the part of any Loan Party or the existence
at any time of any Default under the Loan Documents or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of any Loan Party; (e) shall not be
responsible to any Lender Party for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or
in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate
or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, telecopy or telex)
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

                  SECTION 8.03. CNAI and Affiliates. With respect to its
Commitments, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, CNAI shall have
the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender Party
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent; and the term "Lender Party" or "Lender Parties" shall, unless
otherwise expressly indicated, include CNAI in its individual capacity. CNAI and
its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under
indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage
in any kind of business with, any Loan Party, any Subsidiary of any Loan Party
and any Person that may do business with or own securities of any Loan Party or
any such Subsidiary, all as if CNAI were not the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lender Parties.

                  SECTION 8.04. Lender Party Credit Decision. Each Lender Party
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender Party and based on the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender Party and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.05. Indemnification by Lender Parties, (a) Each
Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify each Agent (to the extent not
promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against such Lender Party's
ratable share (determined as provided below) of any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or
arising out of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under the Loan Documents (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED COSTS"); provided,
however, that no Lender Party shall


                                       71

<PAGE>

be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from any Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct as found in a final,
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation
of the foregoing, each Lender Party agrees to reimburse each Agent promptly upon
demand for its ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section
9.04, to the extent that such Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs
and expenses by the Borrower. In the case of any investigation, litigation or
proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 8.05 applies
whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any
Lender Party or any other Person.

                  (b)      Each Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify each
Issuing Bank (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and
against such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Issuing
Bank in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action
taken or omitted by such Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents; provided,
however, that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Issuing Bank's gross
negligence or willful misconduct as found in a final, non-appealable judgment by
a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender Party agrees to reimburse such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its
ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and
expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 9.04, to the extent
that such Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by
the Borrower.

                  (c)      For purposes of this Section 8.05, the Lender
Parties' respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any
time, according to their respective Revolving Credit Commitments at such time.
The failure of any Lender Party to reimburse any Agent or any Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount
required to be paid by the Lender Parties to such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender Party of
its obligation hereunder to reimburse such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender Party shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender Party to reimburse such Agent or
such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such other Lender Party's ratable
share of such amount. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of any Lender Party hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each Lender
Party contained in this Section 8.05 shall survive the payment in full of
principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 8.06. Successor Agents. Any Agent may resign at any
time by giving written notice thereof to the Lender Parties and the Borrower and
may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders;
provided, however, that any removal of the Administrative Agent will not be
effective until it has been replaced as Collateral Agent and released from all
obligations in respect thereof. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Administrative Agent shall resign if at any time the Administrative Agent is
not a Lender having a Revolving Credit Commitment equal to the lesser of
$10,000,000 or the Revolving Credit Commitment of the next highest Lender (or
such ratably lesser amount if the Revolving Credit Commitments have been reduced
in accordance with this Agreement). Upon any such resignation or removal, the
Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent, which
appointment shall, provided that no Default has occurred and is continuing, be
subject to the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after
the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders'
removal


                                       72

<PAGE>

of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lender
Parties, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States or of any State thereof and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000, which appointment shall,
provided that no Default has occurred and is continuing, be subject to the
consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as an Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent, and, in the case of a successor Collateral Agent, upon the
execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments
thereto, and such amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other
instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required
Lenders may request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or
purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor Agent shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges
and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. If within 45 days
after written notice is given of the retiring Agent's resignation or removal
under this Section 8.06 no successor Agent shall have been appointed and shall
have accepted such appointment, then on such 45th day (i) the retiring Agent's
resignation or removal shall become effective, (ii) the retiring Agent shall
thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents
and (iii) the Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all duties of the
retiring Agent under the Loan Documents until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided above. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as an Agent shall have become effective, the
provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 9.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Notes or any other Loan Document, nor consent
to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed (or, in the case of the
Collateral Documents, consented to) by the Required Lenders, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver
or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all of the Lenders (other than
any Lender Party that is, at such time, a Defaulting Lender), do any of the
following at any time: (i) waive any of the conditions specified in Section 3.01
or, in the case of the Initial Extension of Credit, Section 3.02, (ii) change
the number of Lenders or the percentage of (x) the Commitments, (y) the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Advances or (z) the aggregate Available
Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit that, in each case, shall be required
for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, (iii) release the
Borrower with respect to the Obligations or reduce or limit the obligations of
any Guarantor under Article VII or release such Guarantor or otherwise limit
such Guarantor's liability with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, (iv)
release any individual Eligible Real Estate Asset or all or substantially all of
the Collateral, in each case in any transaction or series of related
transactions, or permit the creation, incurrence, assumption or existence of any
Lien on any individual Eligible Real Estate Asset or all or substantially all of
the Collateral, in each case in any transaction or series of related
transactions, to secure any Obligations other than Obligations owing to the
Secured Parties under the Loan Documents, (v) amend this Section 9.01, (vi)
increase the Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional
obligations, (vii) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any
fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (vii) postpone any date fixed for any
payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts
payable hereunder or amend Section 2.06, or (ix) limit the liability of any Loan
Party under any of the Loan Documents; provided further that no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action,
affect the rights or obligations of the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, under
this Agreement; and provided further that no amendment, waiver or


                                       73

<PAGE>

consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in
addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or
duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents.

                  SECTION 9.02. Notices, Etc, (a) All notices and other
communications provided for hereunder shall be either (x) in writing (including
telecopier or telegraphic communication) and mailed, telecopied, telegraphed or
delivered or (y) as and to the extent set forth in Section 9.02(b) and in the
proviso to this Section 9.02(a), in an electronic medium and delivered as set

Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, at its address at Two Perms Way,
New Castle, Delaware 19720, Attention: Bank Loan Syndications Department; or, as

such party in a written notice to the other parties and, as to each other party,
at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. All such notices and
communications shall, when mailed, telecopied, telegraphed or e-mailed, be
effective when deposited in the mails, telecopied, delivered to the telegraph
company or confirmed by e-mail, respectively, except that notices and
communications to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article II, III or VIII
shall not be effective until received by the Administrative Agent. Delivery by
telecopier of an executed counterpart of any amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Notes or of any Exhibit hereto to be executed
and delivered hereunder shall be effective as delivery of an original executed
counterpart thereof. The Collateral Agent shall notify each of the Ground
Lessors (as defined in the Mortgages) of the occurrence of any Event of Default
hereunder of which the Collateral Agent has actual knowledge by registered or
certified mail to such Ground Lessor's address set forth in the Participation
Agreement or Subject Lease to which it is a party; on the Closing Date the
addresses of such Ground Lessors are: The Pasadena Community Development
Commission, 100 N. Garfield Ave., Rm. 222, Pasadena, California 91109; and The
Cerritos Redevelopment Agency, Civic Center, Bloomfield Avenue at 183rd Street,

anything herein to the contrary, the failure of the Collateral Agent to provide
such notice to such Ground Lessors shall not impair or otherwise affect any of
the rights and remedies of the Secured Parties under the Loan Documents or
applicable law.

                  (b)      So long as CNAI is the Administrative Agent,
materials required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.03(a), (b), (c) and (f)
shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent in an electronic medium in a
format acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties by e-mail
at oploanswebadmin@citigroup.com. The Borrower agrees that the Administrative
Agent may make such materials, as well as any other written information,
documents, instruments and other material relating to the Borrower, any Loan
Party, any of their Subsidiaries or any other materials or matters relating to
this Agreement, the Notes or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the "COMMUNICATIONS") available to the Lender Parties by posting
such notices on "e-Disclosure" (the "PLATFORM"), the Administrative Agent's
internet delivery system that is part of Fixed Income Direct, Global Fixed
Income's primary web portal. Although the primary web portal is secured with a
dual firewall and a User ID/Password Authorization System and the Platform is
secured through a single user per deal authorization method whereby each user
may access the Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, the Borrower acknowledges
that (i) the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not
necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated
with such distribution, (ii) the Platform is provided "as is" and "as available"
and (iii) neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates warrants
the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the Communications or the Platform and


                                       74

<PAGE>

each expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the Communications
or the Platform. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory,
including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from
viruses or other code defects, is made by the Administrative Agent or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the Platform.

                  (c)      Each Lender Party agrees that notice to it (as
provided in the next sentence) (a "NOTICE") specifying that any Communications
have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such
information, documents or other materials to such Lender Party for purposes of
this Agreement, provided that, if requested by any Lender Party, the
Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy of the Communications to such Lender
Party by e-mail or telecopier. Each Lender Party agrees (i) to notify the
Administrative Agent in writing of such Lender Party's e-mail address to which a
Notice may be sent by electronic transmission (including by electronic
communication) on or before the date such Lender Party becomes a party to this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter to ensure that the Administrative
Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such Lender Party) and (ii)
that any Notice may be sent to such e-mail address.

                  SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of
any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The
remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

                  SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) Each Loan Party agrees
jointly and severally to pay on demand (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses of each Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification and amendment of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, (A) all due diligence, collateral review,
syndication, transportation, computer, duplication, appraisal, audit, insurance,
consultant, search, filing and recording fees and expenses and (B) the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for such Agent with respect thereto,
with respect to advising such Agent as to its rights and responsibilities, or
the perfection, protection or preservation of rights or interests, under the
Loan Documents, with respect to negotiations with any Loan Party or with other
creditors of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of any
Default or any events or circumstances that may give rise to a Default and with
respect to presenting claims in or otherwise participating in or monitoring any
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding involving creditors' rights
generally and any proceeding ancillary thereto) and (ii) all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each Agent and each Lender Party in
connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings
or otherwise) of the Loan Documents, whether in any action, suit or litigation,
or any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding affecting creditors'
rights generally (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel for such Agent and each Lender Party with respect thereto).

                  (b)      Each Loan Party agrees to indemnify, defend and save
and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and against, and shall pay on
demand, any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that
may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each
case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including, without
limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or
preparation of a defense in connection therewith) (i) the Facilities, the actual
or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances or the Letters of Credit, the
Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated thereby or (ii) the
actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials on any property of any Loan
Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any Environmental Action relating in any way
to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent such claim,
damage, loss, liability or


                                       75

<PAGE>

expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other
proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 9.04(b) applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or
creditors or an Indemnified Party, whether or not any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents are consummated. Each Loan Party also agrees not to assert
any claim against any Agent, any Lender Party or any of their Affiliates, or any
of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
arising out of or otherwise relating to the Facilities, the actual or proposed
use of the proceeds of the Advances or the Letters of Credit, the Loan Documents
or any of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

                  (c)      If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any
Eurodollar Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a
Lender Party other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance,
as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.09(b)(i) or
2.10(d), acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or
for any other reason, or if the Borrower fails to make any payment or prepayment
of an Advance for which a notice of prepayment has been given or that is
otherwise required to be made, whether pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.06 or 6.01 or
otherwise, the Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of
such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender Party any amounts required to compensate such Lender
Party for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur
as a result of such payment or Conversion or such failure to pay or prepay, as
the case may be, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by any Lender Party to fund or maintain such Advance.

                  (d)      If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs,
expenses or other amounts payable by it under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel and indemnities, such amount
may be paid on behalf of such Loan Party by any Agent or any Lender Party, in
its sole discretion.

                  (e)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the
agreements and obligations of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties contained
in Sections 2.10 and 2.12, Section 7.06 and this Section 9.04 shall survive the
payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder
and under any of the other Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 9.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request
or the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.01, each Agent and each Lender Party and each of their
respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and otherwise apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent, such Lender Party
or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any
other Loan Party against any and all of the Obligations of the Borrower or such
Loan Party now or hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, irrespective of
whether such Agent or such Lender Party shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or such Note or Notes and although such obligations may be unmatured.
Each Agent and each Lender Party agrees promptly to notify the Borrower or such
Loan Party after any such set-off and application; provided, however, that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of each Agent and each Lender Party and their respective
Affiliates


                                       76

<PAGE>

under this Section 9.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including,
without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Agent, such Lender Party
and their respective Affiliates may have.

                  SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower, each Guarantor named
on the signature pages hereto and each Agent and the Administrative Agent shall
have been notified by each Initial Lender, each Initial Issuing Bank and each
Arranger that such Initial Lender, such Initial Issuing Bank or such Arranger,
as the case may be, has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Guarantors named on the signature
pages hereto and each Agent and each Lender Party and their respective
successors and assigns, except that neither the Borrower nor any other Loan
Party shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein
without the prior written consent of the Lender Parties.

                  SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender
may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note
or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be
of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under
and in respect of one or more of the Facilities, (ii) except in the case of an
assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender,
an Affiliate of any Lender or a Fund Affiliate of any Lender or an assignment of
all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the aggregate
amount of the Commitments being assigned to such Eligible Assignee pursuant to
such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 under each
Facility or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or such lesser
amount as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent and, so long as no
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of effectiveness of
such assignment, the Borrower), (iii) each such assignment shall be to an
Eligible Assignee, (iv) no such assignments shall be permitted without the
consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) until the Administrative Agent shall have notified the
Lender Parties that syndication of the Commitments hereunder has been completed
and (v) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note or Notes subject to such
assignment and, except if such assignment is being made by a Lender to an
Affiliate or Fund Affiliate of such Lender, a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500.

                  (b)      Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and
Acceptance, (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, hereunder and (ii) the Lender or Issuing
Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.10, 2.12, 7.06,
8.05 and 9.04 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising
prior to such assignment) and be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the
remaining portion of an assigning Lender's or Issuing Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall cease to be
a party hereto).

                  (c)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, each Lender Party assignor thereunder and each assignee thereunder
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties thereto and hereto as
follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such
assigning Lender Party makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with any Loan Document or the


                                       77

<PAGE>

execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or
purported to be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (ii) such assigning
Lender Party makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility
with respect to the financial condition of any Loan Party or the performance or
observance by any Loan Party of any of its obligations under any Loan Document
or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such
assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent,
such assigning Lender Party or any other Lender Party and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under the Loan
Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental
thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be.

                  (d)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its
address referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lender Parties and the Commitment under each Facility of,
and principal amount of the Advances owing under each Facility to, each Lender
Party from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties may treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender Party hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (e)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender Party and an assignee, together with any Note or
Notes subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such
Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit D hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the
information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
thereof to the Borrower and each other Agent. In the case of any assignment by a
Lender, within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the
Borrower, at its own expense, shall, if requested by the applicable Lender,
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered
Note or Notes a new Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount
equal to the Commitment assumed by it under each Facility pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance and, if any assigning Lender has retained a Commitment
hereunder under such Facility, a new Note to the order of such assigning Lender
in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Note or
Notes, if any, shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective
date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially
the form of Exhibit A hereto.

                  (f)      Each Issuing Bank may assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the undrawn
portion of its Letter of Credit Commitment at any time; provided, however, that
(i) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that immediately prior to
such assignment was an Issuing Bank or an assignment of all of an Issuing Bank's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Letter of Credit
Commitment of the assigning Issuing Bank being


                                       78

<PAGE>

assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the
Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be
less than $10,000,000 and shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof, (ii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee and
(iii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500, provided, that such fee shall not be payable if the assigning Issuing
Bank is making such assignment simultaneously with the assignment in its
capacity as a Lender of all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment to
the same Eligible Assignee.

                  (g)      Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or
more Persons (other than any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to
it and the Note or Notes (if any) held by it);provided, however, that (i) such
Lender Parry's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
its Commitments) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender Party shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, (iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such Note
for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the other Lender Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender Party in connection with such Lender Party's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, (v) no participant under any such participation shall have
any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan
Document, or any consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except to
the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of,
or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in
each case to the extent subject to such participation or postpone any date fixed
for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other
amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or release all or substantially all of the Collateral and (vi)
if, at the time of such sale, such Lender Party was entitled to payments under
Section 2.12(a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to
interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include
(in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other
amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any,
applicable with respect to such participant on such date, provided, that such
participant complies with the requirements of Section 2.12(e).

                  (h)      Any Lender Party may, in connection with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to
this Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee
or participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender
Party by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided, however, that, prior to any
such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
received by it from such Lender Party.

                  (i)      Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender Party may at any time create a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any
Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System.

                  SECTION 9.08. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.09. No Liability of the Issuing Banks. The Borrower
assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of
any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither
any Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or
responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any
acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b)
the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement
thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by such Issuing Bank
against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter
of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate
reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in
making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the
Borrower shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank
shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not
consequential, damages suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves were
caused by (i) such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence as
determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of
Credit comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Bank's
willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the
presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the terms
and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face
to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary.

                  SECTION 9.10. Confidentiality. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender Party shall disclose any Confidential Information to any
Person without the consent of the Borrower, other than (a) to such
Administrative Agent's or such Lender Party's Affiliates and their officers,
directors, employees, agents and advisors and to actual or prospective Eligible
Assignees and participants, and then only on a confidential basis, (b) as
required by any law, rule or regulation or judicial process, (c) as requested or
required by any state, Federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating such
Lender Party and (d) to any rating agency when required by it, provided that,
prior to any such disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the
confidentiality of any Confidential Information relating to the Loan Parties
received by it from such Lender Party. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any
other written or oral understanding or agreement to which the Loan Parties, the
Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties are parties or by which they are
bound, the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) any obligations of confidentiality contained
herein and therein do not apply and have not applied from the commencement of
discussions between the parties to the tax treatment and tax structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and any related transactions or
arrangements), and (ii) the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the
Lender Parties may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any
kind, the U.S. tax treatment of and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent or
the Lender Parties, as the case may be, relating to such U.S. tax treatment and
tax structure, all within the meaning of Treasury regulations Section 1.6011-4;
provided, however, that each of the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent
and the Lender Parties recognizes that the privilege each has to maintain, in
its sole discretion, the confidentiality of a communication relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including a confidential
communication with its attorney or a confidential communication with a federally
authorized tax practitioner under Section 7525 of the Internal Revenue Code, is
not intended to be affected by the foregoing.

                  SECTION 9.11. Release of Collateral. Upon the sale, lease,
transfer or other disposition of any item of Collateral of any Loan Party
(including, without limitation, as a result of the sale, in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents, of the Loan Party that owns such Collateral) in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent will, at
the Borrower's expense,


                                       80

<PAGE>

execute and deliver to such Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may
reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the
assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Document in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 9.12. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a
party, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any right that any parry may otherwise have to bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (b)      Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party in any New York State or
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                  SECTION 9.13. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
New York.
