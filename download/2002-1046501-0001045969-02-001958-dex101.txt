                        2. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

     2.1. COMMITMENT TO LEND. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Credit Agreement, each of the Lenders severally agrees to lend to the
Borrower and the Borrower may borrow, repay, and reborrow from time to time from
the Closing Date up to but not including the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date
upon notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with
Section 2.6, such sums as are requested by the Borrower up to a maximum
aggregate amount outstanding (after giving effect to all amounts requested) at
any one time equal to such Lender's Commitment minus such Lender's Commitment
Percentage of the sum of the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations, provided that the sum of the outstanding amount of the Revolving
Credit Loans (after giving effect to all amounts requested) plus the Maximum
Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations shall not at any time
exceed the Total Commitment at such time. The Revolving Credit Loans shall be
made pro rata in accordance with each Lender's Commitment Percentage in respect
of Revolving Credit Loans. Each request for a Revolving Credit Loan hereunder
shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the
conditions set forth in Section 12 and Section 13, in the case of the initial
Revolving Credit Loans to be made on the Closing Date, and Section 13, in the
case of all other Revolving Credit Loans, have been satisfied on the date of
such request.

     2.2. COMMITMENT FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
for the accounts of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment
Percentages a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") calculated at the rate of
one-half of one percent (0.50%) per annum on the average daily amount during
each calendar quarter or portion thereof from the Closing Date to the Revolving
Credit Loan Maturity Date or any earlier date on which the Commitments shall
terminate by which the Total Commitment minus the sum of the Maximum Drawing
Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceeds the outstanding amount
of Revolving Credit Loans. The Commitment Fee shall be payable quarterly in
arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter for the immediately preceding
calendar quarter commencing on the first such date following the date hereof,
with a final payment on the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date or any earlier
date on which the Commitments shall terminate.

     2.3. REDUCTION OF TOTAL COMMITMENT. The Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice
to the Administrative Agent to reduce by $1,000,000 or an integral multiple
thereof or to terminate entirely the Total Commitment, whereupon the Commitments
of the Lenders shall be reduced pro rata in accordance with their respective
Commitment Percentages of the amount specified in such notice or, as the case
may be, terminated. Promptly after receiving any notice of the Borrower
delivered pursuant to this Section 2.3, the Administrative Agent will notify the
Lenders of the substance thereof. Upon the effective date of any such reduction
or termination, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
respective accounts of the Lenders the full amount

<PAGE>

                                      -26-

of any Commitment Fee then accrued on the amount of the reduction. No reduction
or termination of the Commitments may be reinstated.

     2.4. THE REVOLVING CREDIT NOTES. The Revolving Credit Loans shall be
evidenced by separate promissory notes of the Borrower in substantially the form
of Exhibit A hereto (each a "Revolving Credit Note"), dated as of the Closing
Date (or such other date on which a Lender may become a party hereto in
accordance with Section 16 hereof) and completed with appropriate insertions.
One Revolving Credit Note shall be payable to the order of each Lender in a
principal amount equal to such Lender's Commitment or, if less, the outstanding
amount of all Revolving Credit Loans made by such Lender, plus interest accrued
thereon, as set forth below. The Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to
make or cause to be made, at or about the time of the Drawdown Date of any
Revolving Credit Loan or at the time of receipt of any payment of principal on
such Lender's Revolving Credit Note, an appropriate notation on such Lender's
Revolving Credit Note Record reflecting the making of such Revolving Credit Loan
or (as the case may be) the receipt of such payment. The outstanding amount of
the Revolving Credit Loans set forth on such Lender's Revolving Credit Note
Record shall be prima facie evidence of the principal amount thereof owing and
unpaid to such Lender, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording,
any such amount on such Lender's Revolving Credit Note Record shall not limit or
otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any
Revolving Credit Note to make payments of principal of or interest on any
Revolving Credit Note when due.

     2.5. INTEREST ON REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.10,

     respect to Base Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.

            (b)  Each Revolving Credit Loan which is a Eurodollar Rate Loan
     shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date
     thereof and ending on the last day of the Interest Period with respect
     thereto at the rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for
     such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin with respect to Eurodollar
     Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.

            (c)  The Borrower promises to pay interest on each Revolving Credit
     Loan in arrears on each Interest Payment Date with respect thereto.

     2.6. REQUESTS FOR REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. The Borrower shall give to the
Administrative Agent written notice in the form of Exhibit B hereto (or

(a) 12:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Base Rate

Revolving Credit Loan is a Eurodollar Rate Loan) and (iv) the Type of such
Revolving Credit Loan. Promptly upon receipt of any such notice, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each of the Lenders thereof. Each Loan Request

to accept the Revolving Credit Loan requested from the Lenders on the proposed
Drawdown Date. Each Loan Request shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of
$500,000 or an integral multiple thereof.

     2.7. CONVERSION OPTIONS.

            2.7.1. CONVERSION TO DIFFERENT TYPE OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN. The
     Borrower may elect from time to time to convert any outstanding Revolving
     Credit Loan to a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type, provided that (a)
     with respect to any such conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan to a Base
     Rate Loan, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent prior written
     notice of such election no later than 12:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the
     proposed date of such conversion; (b) with respect to any such conversion
     of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Borrower shall give the
     Administrative Agent at least three (3) Eurodollar Business Days prior
     written notice of such election; (c) with respect to any such conversion of
     a Eurodollar Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan, such conversion shall only be
     made on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (d) no
     Revolving Credit Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Rate Loan when any
     Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. On the date on
     which such conversion is being made each Lender shall take such action as
     is necessary to transfer its Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit
     Loans to its Domestic Lending Office or its Eurodollar Lending Office, as
     the case may be. All or any part of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of
     any Type may be converted into a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type as
     provided herein, provided that any partial conversion shall be in an
     aggregate principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple thereof. Each
     Conversion Request relating to the conversion of a Revolving Credit Loan to
     a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be irrevocable by the Borrower.

            2.7.2. CONTINUATION OF TYPE OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN. Any Revolving
     Credit Loan of any Type may be continued as a Revolving Credit Loan of the
     same Type upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by
     compliance by the Borrower with the notice provisions contained in
     Section 2.7.1; provided that no Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued as
     such when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of
     which officers of the Administrative Agent active upon the Borrower's
     account have actual knowledge, but shall be automatically converted to a
     Base Rate Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating
     thereto ending during the continuance of any such Default or Event of
     Default. In the event that the Borrower fails to provide any such notice
     with respect to the continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan as such, then
     such Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate
     Loan on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto. The
     Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly when any such
     automatic conversion contemplated by this Section 2.7 is scheduled to
     occur.

            2.7.3. EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS. Any conversion to or from Eurodollar
     Rate Loans shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections
     so that, after giving

<PAGE>

                                      -28-

     effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of all Eurodollar Rate Loans
     having the same Interest Period shall not be less than $500,000 or a whole
     multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. No more than ten (10) Eurodollar
     Rate Loans having different Interest Periods may be outstanding at any
     time.

     2.8.  FUNDS FOR REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

            2.8.1. FUNDING PROCEDURES. Not later than 2:00 p.m. (Boston time) on
     the proposed Drawdown Date of any Revolving Credit Loans, each of the
     Lenders will make available to the Administrative Agent, at the
     Administrative Agent's Office, in immediately available funds, the amount
     of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount of the requested
     Revolving Credit Loans. Upon receipt from each Lender of such amount, and
     upon receipt of the documents required by Sections 12 and 13 and the
     satisfaction of the other conditions set forth therein, to the extent
     applicable, the Administrative Agent will make available to the Borrower
     the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Loans made available to the
     Administrative Agent by the Lenders. The failure or refusal of any Lender
     to make available to the Administrative Agent at the aforesaid time and
     place on any Drawdown Date the amount of its Commitment Percentage of the
     requested Revolving Credit Loans shall not relieve any other Lender from
     its several obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative
     Agent the amount of such other Lender's Commitment Percentage of any
     requested Revolving Credit Loans.

            2.8.2. ADVANCES BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent
     may, unless notified to the contrary by any Lender prior to a Drawdown
     Date, assume that such Lender has made available to the Administrative
     Agent on such Drawdown Date the amount of such Lender's Commitment
     Percentage of the Revolving Credit Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date,
     and the Administrative Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in
     reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
     corresponding amount. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative
     Agent such amount on a date after such Drawdown Date, such Lender shall pay
     to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (a)
     the average computed for the period referred to in clause (c) below, of the
     weighted average interest rate paid by the Administrative Agent for federal
     funds acquired by the Administrative Agent during each day included in such
     period, times (b) the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such
     Revolving Credit Loans, times (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
     number of days that elapse from and including such Drawdown Date to the
     date on which the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such
     Revolving Credit Loans shall become immediately available to the
     Administrative Agent, and the denominator of which is 360. A statement of
     the Administrative Agent submitted to such Lender with respect to any
     amounts owing under this paragraph shall be prima facie evidence of the
     amount due and owing to the Administrative Agent by such Lender. If the
     amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit
     Loans is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender
     within three (3) Business Days following such Drawdown Date, the
     Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount from the
     Borrower on

<PAGE>

                                      -29-

     demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the
     Revolving Credit Loans made on such Drawdown Date.

                   3. REPAYMENT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

     3.1. MATURITY. The Borrower promises to pay on the Revolving Credit Loan
Maturity Date, and there shall become absolutely due and payable on the
Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date, all of the Revolving Credit Loans
outstanding on such date, together with any and all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon.

     3.2. MANDATORY REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. If at any time the sum
of the outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans, the Maximum Drawing
Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceeds the Total Commitment at
such time, then the Borrower shall immediately pay the amount of such excess to
the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of the Lenders for
application: first, to any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations; second, to the
Revolving Credit Loans; and third, to provide to the Administrative Agent cash
collateral for Reimbursement Obligations as contemplated by Section 5.2(b) and
(c). Each payment of any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or prepayment of
Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated among the Lenders, in proportion, as
nearly as practicable, to each Reimbursement Obligation or (as the case may be)
the respective unpaid principal amount of each Lender's Revolving Credit Note,
with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior payments or
repayments not exactly in proportion. In addition, the Borrower shall repay the
Revolving Credit Loans in accordance with Section 4.3.

     3.3. OPTIONAL REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. The Borrower shall have
the right, at its election, to repay the outstanding amount of the Revolving
Credit Loans, as a whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium (but
subject to Section 6.9), provided that any full or partial prepayment of the
outstanding amount of any Eurodollar Rate Loans pursuant to this Section 3.3
that is not made on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto shall
be accompanied by any amounts due under Section 6.9. The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent prior written notice of any proposed prepayment pursuant to
this Section 3.3 of Base Rate Loans, and three (3) Eurodollar Business Days
notice of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this Section 3.3 of Eurodollar
Rate Loans, in each case specifying the proposed date of prepayment of Revolving
Credit Loans and the principal amount to be prepaid. Each such partial
prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be in an integral multiple of
$100,000, shall be accompanied by the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on
the principal prepaid to the date of prepayment and shall be applied, in the
absence of instruction by the Borrower, first to the principal of Base Rate
Loans and then to the principal of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Each partial
prepayment shall be allocated among the Lenders, in proportion, as nearly as
practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amount of each Lender's
Revolving Credit Note, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize
any prior repayments not exactly in proportion.

                                4. THE TERM LOAN.

     4.1. COMMITMENT TO LEND. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Credit Agreement, each Lender agrees to lend to the Borrower on the Closing
Date an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage in respect of the Term Loan of
the principal amount of $25,000,000.

<PAGE>

                                      -30-

     4.2. THE TERM NOTES. The Term Loan shall be evidenced by separate
promissory notes of the Borrower in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto
(each a "Term Note"), dated the Closing Date (or such other date on which a
Lender may become a party hereto in accordance with Section 16 hereof) and
completed with appropriate insertions. One Term Note shall be payable to the
order of each Lender in a principal amount equal to such Lender's Commitment
Percentage of the Term Loan and representing the obligation of the Borrower to
pay to such Lender such principal amount or, if less, the outstanding amount of
such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Term Loan, plus interest accrued
thereon, as set forth below. The Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to
make or cause to be made a notation on such Lender's Term Note Record reflecting
the original principal amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Term
Loan and, at or about the time of such Lender's receipt of any principal payment
on such Lender's Term Note, an appropriate notation on such Lender's Term Note
Record reflecting such payment. The aggregate unpaid amount set forth on such
Lender's Term Note Record shall be prima facie evidence of the principal amount
thereof owing and unpaid to such Lender, but the failure to record, or any error
in so recording, any such amount on such Lender's Term Note Record shall not
affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Term Note to make
payments of principal of and interest on any Term Note when due.

     4.3. MANDATORY PREPAYMENT OF TERM LOANS.

            4.3.1. SCHEDULE OF INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL OF TERM LOAN.
     The Borrower promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
     the Lenders the principal amount of the Term Loan in nineteen (19)
     consecutive equal quarterly payments of $1,250,000, such payments to be due
     and payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Borrower,
     commencing on March 30, 2003, with a final payment on the Term Loan
     Maturity Date in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the Term Loan.

            4.3.2. EXCESS OPERATING CASH FLOW RECAPTURE. For each fiscal year of
     the Borrower ending during or after December 2003, the Borrower shall make
     a prepayment of the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the Applicable
     Excess Cash Flow Percentage of the amount of Consolidated Excess Operating
     Cash Flow for such fiscal year, such mandatory prepayment to be due one
     hundred five (105) days after the end of each applicable fiscal year and to
     be applied in the manner set forth in Section 4.3.4.

            4.3.3. PROCEEDS OF CERTAIN EVENTS. Within five (5) Business Days
     after the receipt by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of:

                    (a)  Net Cash Sale Proceeds from Asset Sales consummated
            after the Closing Date (other than any sale, lease, license or other
            disposition of assets permitted by Section 10.5.2.1(a), (b) or (c)
            and any Sale/Leaseback Transactions permitted by Section 10.6 ) in
            excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year;

                    (b)  Net Cash Equity Issuance Proceeds from Equity Issuances
            consummated after the Closing Date in excess of $5,000,000 in the
            aggregate in any fiscal year (provided, however, that Net Cash
            Equity Issuance Proceeds raised by the Borrower and used to finance
            a Permitted Acquisition within

<PAGE>

                                      -31-

            fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of such Net Cash Equity
            Issuance Proceeds shall not be required to be repaid pursuant to
            this Section 4.3.3(b) (nor shall such Net Cash Equity Issuance
            Proceeds be considered to be such for the purposes of counting
            against any dollar baskets set forth in this Section 4.3.3(b)), and
            provided, further, that from and after the date Net Cash Equity
            Issuance Proceeds for any fiscal year have exceeded $5,000,000,
            additional Net Cash Equity Issuance Proceeds shall not be required
            to be repaid pursuant this Section 4.3.3(b), until the aggregate
            amount of such additional Net Cash Equity Issuance Proceeds is
            greater than $1,000,000);

                    (c)  Net Cash Debt Issuance Proceeds from Debt Issuances
            consummated after the Closing Date in excess of $2,000,000 in the
            aggregate in any fiscal year;

                    (d)  cash proceeds, net of costs of collection, in excess of
            $100,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year received from Casualty
            Events by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which have not
            been reinvested by the Borrower or such Subsidiary within 365 days
            of receipt of such proceeds in the repair or replacement of the
            property so damaged, destroyed or taken (provided, however, if a
            Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such
            proceeds shall be immediately paid to the Administrative Agent); or

                    (e)  cash proceeds, net of costs of collection, in excess of
            $1,000,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year received from income
            tax refunds of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

     the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the respective
     accounts of the Lenders an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
     such net cash proceeds, to be applied in the manner set forth in
     Section 4.3.4.

          4.3.4. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. All payments made pursuant to
     Section 4.3.2 or Section 4.3.3 shall be applied first against the remaining
     scheduled installments of principal of the Term Loan in the inverse order
     of maturity and, if there are no outstanding amounts owed on the Term Loan,
     then to reduce the outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loan,
     provided, however, that, if, at the time of receipt of any Net Cash Equity
     Issuance Proceeds, the Leverage Ratio as at the end of the then most
     recently ended fiscal quarter of the Borrower is less than or equal to
     1.00:1.00, then such proceeds shall be applied to reduce the outstanding
     amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and not the Term Loan; and provided,
     further, that if, at the time of receipt of any Net Cash Equity Issuance
     Proceeds, the Leverage Ratio as at the end of the most recent fiscal
     quarter of the Borrower is greater than 1.00:1.00, such proceeds shall be
     applied to the remaining installments of principal of the Term Loan in the
     inverse order of maturity, but each holder of the Term Loan may elect not
     to receive such prepayment of Net Cash Equity Issuance Proceeds pursuant to
     Section 4.3.3 by notifying the Administrative Agent in writing of such
     election prior to the time such payment is due, and the portion of such
     prepayment so declined shall instead be applied to reduce the outstanding
     amount of Revolving Credit Loans pro rata among the Lenders, but not to
     reduce the Total Commitment in connection therewith. If the Administrative
     Agent does not receive the required notice

<PAGE>

                                      -32-

     from a holder of the Term Loan of an election not to receive such
     prepayment prior to the date such payment is due, such holder will be
     deemed not to have made such an election. The Administrative Agent shall
     promptly notify the Borrower in writing of such elections. Such mandatory
     prepayments shall be allocated among the Lenders in proportion, as nearly
     as practicable, to the respective outstanding amounts of each Lender's
     Notes, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior
     prepayments not exactly in proportion. No amounts repaid with respect to
     the Term Loan pursuant to this Section 4.3 may be reborrowed.

     4.4. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT OF TERM LOAN. The Borrower shall have the right at
any time to prepay the Term Notes on or before the Term Loan Maturity Date, as a
whole, or in part, upon not less than five (5) Business Days prior written
notice to the Administrative Agent, without premium or penalty (but subject to
Section 6.9), provided that (a) each partial prepayment shall be in the
principal amount of $100,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and (b) each
partial prepayment shall be allocated among the Lenders, in proportion, as
nearly as practicable, to the respective outstanding principal amount of each
Lender's Term Note, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any
prior prepayments not exactly in proportion. Any prepayment of principal of the
Term Loan shall include all unpaid interest accrued to the date of prepayment
and shall be applied against the scheduled installments of principal due on the
Term Loan in the order of maturity. No amount repaid with respect to the Term
Loan may be reborrowed.

     4.5. INTEREST ON TERM LOAN.

            4.5.1. INTEREST RATES. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.10,
     the Term Loan shall bear interest during each Interest Period relating to
     all or any portion of the Term Loan at the following rates:

                    (a)  To the extent that all or any portion of the Term Loan
            bears interest during such Interest Period at the Base Rate, the
            Term Loan or such portion shall bear interest during such Interest
            Period at the rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
            Applicable Margin with respect to Base Rate Loans as in effect from
            time to time.

                    (b)  To the extent that all or any portion of the Term Loan
            bears interest during such Interest Period at the Eurodollar Rate,
            the Term Loan or such portion shall bear interest during such
            Interest Period at the rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate
            determined for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin with
            respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.

                    (c)  The Borrower promises to pay interest on the Term Loan
            or any portion thereof outstanding during each Interest Period in
            arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable to such Interest
            Period.

            4.5.2. NOTIFICATION BY BORROWER. The Borrower shall notify the
     Administrative Agent, such notice to be irrevocable, at least three (3)
     Eurodollar Business Days prior to

<PAGE>

                                      -33-

     the Drawdown Date of the Term Loan if all or any portion of the Term Loan
     is to bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate. After the Term Loan has been
     made, the provisions of Section 2.7 shall apply mutatis mutandis with
     respect to all or any portion of the Term Loan so that the Borrower may
     have the same interest rate options with respect to all or any portion of
     the Term Loan as it would be entitled to with respect to the Revolving
     Credit Loans.

          4.5.3. AMOUNTS, ETC. Any portion of the Term Loan bearing interest at
     the Eurodollar Rate relating to any Interest Period shall be in the amount
     of $500,000 or an integral multiple thereof. No Interest Period relating to
     the Term Loan or any portion thereof bearing interest at the Eurodollar
     Rate shall extend beyond the date on which a regularly scheduled
     installment payment of the principal of the Term Loan is to be made unless
     a portion of the Term Loan at least equal to such installment payment has
     an Interest Period ending on or prior to such date or is then bearing
     interest at the Base Rate.

                              5. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

     5.1. LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS.

            5.1.1. COMMITMENT TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT. Subject to the terms
     and conditions hereof and the execution and delivery by the Borrower of a
     letter of credit application on the Administrative Agent's customary form
     (a "Letter of Credit Application"), the Administrative Agent on behalf of
     the Lenders and in reliance upon the agreement of the Lenders set forth in
     Section 5.1.4 and upon the representations and warranties of the Borrower
     contained herein, agrees, in its individual capacity, to issue, extend and
     renew for the account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries one or
     more standby or documentary letters of credit (individually, a "Letter of
     Credit"), in such form as may be requested from time to time by the
     Borrower and agreed to by the Administrative Agent (in a manner consistent
     with the Administrative Agent's customary practice); provided, however,
     that, after giving effect to such request, (a) the sum of the aggregate
     Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations shall not
     exceed $10,000,000 at any one time and (b) the sum of (i) the Maximum
     Drawing Amount on all Letters of Credit, (ii) all Unpaid Reimbursement
     Obligations, and (iii) the amount of all Revolving Credit Loans outstanding
     shall not exceed the Total Commitment at such time.

            5.1.2. LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATIONS. Each Letter of Credit
     Application shall be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the
     Administrative Agent. In the event that any provision of any Letter of
     Credit Application shall be inconsistent with any provision of this Credit
     Agreement, then the provisions of this Credit Agreement shall, to the
     extent of any such inconsistency, govern.

            5.1.3. TERMS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Letter of Credit issued,
     extended or renewed hereunder shall, among other things, (a) provide for
     the payment of sight drafts for honor thereunder when presented in
     accordance with the terms thereof and when accompanied by the documents
     described therein, and (b) have an expiry date no

<PAGE>

                                      -34-

     later than one year after its date of issuance unless renewed (for a
     successive period(s) not to exceed one year) in accordance with the terms
     of such Letter of Credit; provided that in no event shall any Letter of
     Credit issued hereunder expire after the date which is fourteen (14) days
     (or, if the Letter of Credit is confirmed by a confirmer or otherwise
     provides for one or more nominated persons, forty-five (45) days) prior to
     the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date unless, no less than fourteen (14)
     days prior to the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date, the Borrower either
     (i) deposits with the Administrative Agent an amount equal to 105% of the
     aggregate Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit, such amount to
     be held by the Administrative Agent as cash collateral for any drawing
     under such Letter of Credit or, (ii) provides a backup letter of credit for
     such Letter of Credit from an issuer and on such terms as are reasonably
     acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Each Letter of Credit so issued,
     extended or renewed shall be subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice
     for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce
     Publication No. 500 or any successor version thereto adopted by the
     Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of its business as a letter of
     credit issuer and in effect at the time of issuance of such Letter of
     Credit (the "Uniform Customs") or, in the case of a standby Letter of
     Credit, either the Uniform Customs or the International Standby Practices
     (ISP98), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 590, or any
     successor code of standby letter of credit practices among banks adopted by
     the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of its business as a
     standby letter of credit issuer and in effect at the time of issuance of
     such Letter of Credit.

            5.1.4. REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS OF LENDERS. Each Lender severally
     agrees that it shall be absolutely liable, without regard to the occurrence
     of any Default or Event of Default or any other condition precedent
     whatsoever, to the extent of such Lender's Commitment Percentage, to
     reimburse the Administrative Agent on demand for the amount of each draft
     paid by the Administrative Agent under each Letter of Credit to the extent
     that such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.2
     (such agreement for a Lender being called herein the "Letter of Credit
     Participation" of such Lender).

            5.1.5. PARTICIPATIONS OF LENDERS. Each such payment made by a Lender
     shall be treated as the purchase by such Lender of a participating interest
     in the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligation under Section 5.2 in an amount
     equal to such payment. Each Lender shall share in accordance with its
     participating interest in any interest which accrues pursuant to
     Section 5.2.

     5.2. REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF THE BORROWER. In order to induce the
Administrative Agent to issue, extend and renew each Letter of Credit and the
Lenders to participate therein, the Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse or pay
to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Administrative Agent or (as
the case may be) the Lenders, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued,
extended or renewed by the Administrative Agent hereunder,

            (a)   except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 5.2(b) and
     (c), on each date that any draft presented under such Letter of Credit is
     honored by the Administrative

<PAGE>

                                      -35-

     Agent, or the Administrative Agent otherwise makes a payment with respect
     thereto, (i) the amount paid by the Administrative Agent under or with
     respect to such Letter of Credit, and (ii) the amount of any taxes, fees,
     charges or other costs and expenses whatsoever incurred by the
     Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with any payment made by
     the Administrative Agent or any Lender under, or with respect to, such
     Letter of Credit,

            (b)   upon the reduction (but not termination) of the Total
     Commitment to an amount less than the Maximum Drawing Amount, an amount
     equal to such difference, which amount shall be held by the Administrative
     Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent as cash
     collateral for all Reimbursement Obligations, and

            (c)   upon the termination of the Total Commitment, or the
     acceleration of the Reimbursement Obligations with respect to all Letters
     of Credit in accordance with Section 14, an amount equal to the then
     Maximum Drawing Amount on all Letters of Credit, which amount shall be held
     by the  Administrative  Agent  for  the  benefit  of the  Lenders  and  the
     Administrative Agent as cash collateral for all Reimbursement Obligations.

Each such payment shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent's Office in immediately available funds. Interest on any
and all amounts remaining unpaid by the Borrower under this Section 5.2 at any
time from the date such amounts become due and payable (whether as stated in
this Section 5.2, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full (whether
before or after judgment) shall be payable to the Administrative Agent on demand
at the rate specified in Section 6.10 for overdue principal on the Revolving
Credit Loans.

     5.3. LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS. If any draft shall be presented or other
demand for payment shall be made under any Letter of Credit, the Administrative
Agent shall notify the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) as
promptly as possible of the date and amount of the draft presented or demand for
payment and of the date and time when it expects to pay such draft or honor such
demand for payment. If the Borrower fails to reimburse the Administrative Agent
as provided in Section 5.2 on or before the date that such draft is paid or
other payment is made by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
at any time thereafter notify the Lenders of the amount of any such Unpaid
Reimbursement Obligation. No later than 2:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the Business
Day next following the receipt of such notice, each Lender shall make available
to the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent's Office, in
immediately available funds, such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid
Reimbursement Obligation, together with an amount equal to the product of (a)
the average, computed for the period referred to in clause (c) below, of the
weighted average interest rate paid by the Administrative Agent for federal
funds acquired by the Administrative Agent during each day included in such
period, times (b) the amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of
such Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation, times (c) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days that elapse from and including the date the
Administrative Agent paid the draft presented for honor or otherwise made
payment to the date on which such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid
Reimbursement Obligation shall become immediately available to the
Administrative Agent, and the denominator of which is 360. The responsibility of
the Administrative Agent to the Borrower and the Lenders shall be only to
determine that the documents (including each draft) delivered

<PAGE>

                                      -36-

under each Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment shall be in
conformity in all material respects with such Letter of Credit.

     5.4. OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Borrower's obligations under this Section 5
shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and
irrespective of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or any
condition precedent whatsoever or any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment
which the Borrower may have or have had against the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit. The Borrower further agrees
with the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement
Obligations under Section 5.2 shall not be affected by, among other things, the
validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if
such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower, the
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any financing institution or other party
to which any Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims or defenses
whatsoever of the Borrower against the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or
any such transferee. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be
liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch
or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with
any Letter of Credit. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender under or in connection with each Letter
of Credit and the related drafts and documents, if done in good faith, shall be
binding upon the Borrower and shall not result in any liability on the part of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender to the Borrower. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4 or any other provision of this
Section 5, including any provision of Section 5.5 hereof, the Borrower shall
have a claim against the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent
shall be liable to the Borrower, for any losses, liabilities and reasonably
out-of-pocket costs an expenses to the extent suffered or incurred by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any Letter of Credit as a
result of the Administrative Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence or
the Administrative Agent's failure to comply with its express obligations under
this Agreement.

     5.5. RELIANCE BY ISSUER. To the extent not inconsistent with Section 5.4,
the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying upon, any Letter of Credit, draft, writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or
teletype message, statement, order or other document believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. To the
extent not inconsistent with Section 5.4, the Administrative Agent shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Credit
Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the
Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all
liability and reasonable out-of-pocket expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Except to the extent
limited by Section 5.4, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Credit Agreement
in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant

<PAGE>

                                      -37-

thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and all future holders of the
Revolving Credit Notes or of a Letter of Credit Participation.

     5.6. LETTER OF CREDIT FEE. With respect to each Letter of Credit issued
hereunder, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent a fee (in each
case, a "Letter of Credit Fee") for each Letter of Credit issued or renewed by
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement at a rate per annum
equal to the Applicable Margin with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans in effect
from time to time, on the Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit for
the period such Letter of Credit is outstanding. In addition, the Borrower will
pay the Administrative Agent, for its own account, a fronting fee equal to
one-eighth of one percent (0.125%) per annum on the Maximum Drawing Amount of
such Letter of Credit for the period such Letter of Credit is outstanding. The
Letter of Credit Fee for each Letter of Credit shall be payable quarterly in
arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter. In respect of each Letter of
Credit, the Borrower shall also pay to the Administrative Agent for the
Administrative Agent's own account, at such other time or times as such charges
are customarily made by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent's
customary issuance, amendment, negotiation or document examination and other
administrative fees as in effect from time to time.

                         6. CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS.

     6.1. FEES. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and the
Arranger, as applicable, the fees set forth in the Fee Letter.

     6.2. FUNDS FOR PAYMENTS.

            6.2.1. PAYMENTS TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. All payments of principal,
     interest, Reimbursement Obligations, Fees and any other amounts due
     hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made on the due
     date thereof to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the respective
     accounts of the Lenders and/or the Administrative Agent, as the case may
     be, at the Administrative Agent's Office or at such other place that the
     Administrative Agent may from time to time designate, in each case at or
     about (or prior to) 11:00 a.m. (Boston, Massachusetts, time or other local
     time at the place of payment) and in immediately available funds.

            6.2.2. NO OFFSET, ETC. All payments by the Borrower hereunder and
     under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made without recoupment,
     setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for or
     withholding of Covered Taxes, unless the Borrower is compelled by law to
     make such deduction or withholding. If any such obligation is imposed upon
     the Borrower with respect to any amount payable by it hereunder or under
     any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrower will pay to the
     Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders or (as the case may
     be) the Administrative Agent, on the date on which such amount is due and
     payable hereunder or under such other Loan Document, such additional amount
     in Dollars as shall be necessary to enable the Lenders or the
     Administrative Agent to receive the same net amount which the Lenders or
     the Administrative Agent would have received on such due date had no such
     obligation been imposed upon the Borrower. The Borrower will deliver
     promptly to the Administrative Agent certificates or other valid vouchers
     for all

<PAGE>

                                      -38-

     Covered Taxes deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by the
     Borrower hereunder or under such other Loan Document.

            6.2.3. NON-U.S. LENDERS. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent
     represents and warrants that, as of the date of this Credit Agreement, the
     payments it is to receive under the Loan Documents are not subject to
     Covered Taxes. If any Lender or the Administrative Agent assigns or sells a
     participation in all or any portion of its rights and obligations under
     this Credit Agreement, such Person agrees to require a condition of such
     assignment or sale that the assignee or participant, on or before the date
     of such assignment or sale, deliver to the Borrower the representation and
     warranty stated in the immediately preceding sentence, together with duly
     completed and executed copies of the appropriate Internal Revenue Service
     forms described below. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby
     further agrees that, if and to the extent it is legally able to do so, it
     shall, prior to the date of the first payment by the Borrower hereunder to
     be made to such Lender or the Administrative Agent or for such Lender's or
     the Administrative Agent's account, deliver to the Borrower and the
     Administrative Agent, as applicable, such certificates, documents or other
     evidence, as and when required by the Code or Treasury Regulations issued
     pursuant thereto, including (a) in the case of a Lender or the
     Administrative Agent that is not a U.S. Person as defined in Section
     7701(a)(30) of the Code for federal income tax purposes (a "Non-U.S.
     Lender") and that is a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
     Code, two (2) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN
     or Form W-8ECI and any other certificate or statement of exemption required
     by Treasury Regulations, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors
     thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender
     establishing that with respect to payments of principal, interest or fees
     hereunder it is (i) not subject to United States federal withholding tax
     under the Code because such payment is effectively connected with the
     conduct by such Lender or Administrative Agent of a trade or business in
     the United States or (ii) totally exempt or partially exempt from United
     States federal withholding tax under a provision of an applicable tax
     treaty, (b) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not a "bank" for
     purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a certificate in form and
     substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the
     Borrower and to the effect that (i) such Non-U.S. Lender is not a "bank"
     for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, is not subject to
     regulatory or other legal requirements as a bank in any jurisdiction, and
     has not been treated as a bank for purposes of any tax, securities law or
     other filing or submission made to any governmental authority, any
     application made to a rating agency or qualification for any exemption from
     any tax, securities law or other legal requirements, (ii) is not a ten (10)
     percent shareholder for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code and
     (iii) is not a controlled foreign corporation receiving interest from a
     related person for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, together
     with a properly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, as
     applicable (or successor forms) and (c) in the case of a Lender or
     Administrative Agent that is a U.S. Person as defined in Section
     7701(a)(30) of the Code and is not a corporation, a properly completed
     Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor form) identifying such
     Lender or Administrative Agent as a U.S. Person. Each Lender or the
     Administrative Agent agrees that it shall, promptly upon a change of its
     lending

<PAGE>

                                      -39-

     office or the selection of any additional lending office, to the extent the
     forms previously delivered by it pursuant to this section are no longer
     effective, and promptly upon the Borrower's or the Administrative Agent's
     reasonable request after the occurrence of any other event (including the
     passage of time) requiring the delivery of a Form W-8BEN, Form W-8ECI, Form
     W-8 or W-9 in addition to or in replacement of the forms previously
     delivered, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, as
     applicable, if and to the extent it is properly entitled to do so, a
     properly completed and executed Form W-8BEN, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8 or W-9,
     as applicable (or any successor forms thereto). The Borrower shall not be
     required to pay any additional amounts to any Lender or the Administrative
     Agent in respect of Covered Taxes pursuant to Section 6.2.2 above to the
     extent that the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have
     arisen but for a failure by such Lender or the Administrative Agent to
     comply with the provisions of this Section 6.2.3; provided, however, that
     the foregoing shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay
     additional amounts pursuant to Section 6.2.2 in the event that, as a result
     of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule,
     regulation or order, or any change in interpretation, administration or
     application thereof, any Lender or the Administrative Agent that was
     previously entitled to receive all payments under this Credit Agreement and
     the Notes without deduction or withholding of any Covered Taxes is no
     longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence
     at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject
     to withholding.

     6.3. COMPUTATIONS. All computations of interest on the Eurodollar Rate
Loans and of Fees shall be based on a 360-day year and paid for the actual
number of days elapsed. All computations of interest on the Base Rate Loans
shall be based on a 365 (or 366, as the case may be)-day year and paid for the
actual number of days elapsed. Except as otherwise provided in the definition of
the term "Interest Period" with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, whenever a
payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents becomes due on a day
that is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall accrue during such
extension. Absent manifest error, the outstanding amount of the Loans as
reflected on the Revolving Credit Note Records and the Term Note Records from
time to time shall be considered correct and binding on the Borrower unless
within five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Borrower of any notice from
the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders of such outstanding amount, the
Administrative Agent or such Lender shall notify the Borrower, or the Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, to the contrary.

     6.4. INABILITY TO DETERMINE EURODOLLAR RATE. In the event, prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period relating to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, the
Administrative Agent shall determine or be notified by the Required Lenders that
(a) adequate and reasonable methods do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar
Rate that would otherwise determine the rate of interest to be applicable to any
Eurodollar Rate Loan during any Interest Period or (b) the Eurodollar Rate
determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of making or maintaining their Eurodollar
Rate Loans during such period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give
notice of such determination (which shall be conclusive and binding on the
Borrower and the Lenders) to the Borrower and the Lenders. In such event (i) any
Loan Request or Conversion Request with respect to

<PAGE>

                                      -40-

Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be automatically withdrawn and shall be deemed a
request for Base Rate Loans, (ii) each Eurodollar Rate Loan will automatically,
on the last day of the then current Interest Period relating thereto, become a
Base Rate Loan, and (iii) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
determine that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist,
whereupon the Administrative Agent or, as the case may be, the Administrative
Agent upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, shall so notify the Borrower
and the Lenders.

     6.5. ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if the future
adoption of or change in any law, regulation, treaty or directive or the
interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to
make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Lender shall forthwith give notice
of such circumstances to the Borrower and the other Lenders and thereupon (a)
the commitment of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or convert Base Rate
Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall forthwith be suspended and (b) such
Lender's Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Rate Loans, if
any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans or within such earlier
period as may be required by law. The Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, upon demand by such Lender,
any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs
incurred by such Lender in making any conversion in accordance with this
Section 6.5, including any interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of
funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans
hereunder.

     6.6. ADDITIONAL COSTS, ETC. If the future adoption of or change in any
applicable law, which expression, as used herein, includes statutes, rules and
regulations thereunder and interpretations thereof by any competent court or by
any governmental or other regulatory body or official charged with the
administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives,
instructions and notices at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or
otherwise issued to any Lender or the Administrative Agent by any central bank
or other fiscal, monetary or other authority (whether or not having the force of
law), shall:

            (a)  subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Covered
     Taxes with respect to this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any
     Letters of Credit, such Lender's Commitment or the Loans (other than taxes
     based upon or measured by the income or profits of such Lender or the
     Administrative Agent), or

            (b)  materially change the basis of taxation (except for changes in
     taxes on income or profits) of payments to any Lender of the principal of
     or the interest on any Loans or any other amounts payable to any Lender or
     the Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement or any of the other
     Loan Documents, or

            (c)  impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the
     extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this Credit Agreement) any
     special deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or other
     similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law) against
     assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans by, or
     letters of credit issued by, or commitments of an office of any Lender, or

<PAGE>

                                      -41-

            (d)  impose on any Lender or the Administrative Agent any other
     conditions or requirements with respect to this Credit Agreement, the other
     Loan Documents, any Letters of Credit, the Loans, such Lender's Commitment,
     or any class of loans, letters of credit or commitments of which any of the
     Loans or such Lender's Commitment forms a part, and the result of any of
     the foregoing is

                 (i)     to increase the cost to any Lender of making, funding,
            issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining any of the Loans or such
            Lender's Commitment or any Letter of Credit, or

                 (ii)    to reduce the amount of principal, interest,
            Reimbursement Obligation or other amount payable to such Lender or
            the Administrative Agent hereunder on account of such Lender's
            Commitment, any Letter of Credit or any of the Loans, or

                 (iii)   to require such Lender or the Administrative Agent to
            make any payment or to forego any interest or Reimbursement
            Obligation or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which
            payment or foregone interest or Reimbursement Obligation or other
            sum is calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum
            receivable or deemed received by such Lender or the Administrative
            Agent from the Borrower hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Borrower will, within thirty (30) days
following demand made by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative
Agent at any time and from time to time and as often as the occasion therefor
may arise, and upon presentation by such Lender or (as the case may be) the
Administrative Agent of a certificate in accordance with Section 6.8 hereof, pay
to such Lender or the Administrative Agent such additional amounts as will be
sufficient to compensate such Lender or the Administrative Agent for such
additional cost, reduction, payment or foregone interest or Reimbursement
Obligation or other sum.

Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to Section 6.2.2,
this Section 6.6 or Section 6.7 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with
legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its applicable
lending office if the making of such change would avoid the need for or
substantially reduce the amount of any such additional amounts which may
thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole and absolute determination of such
Lender be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender, which determination by such
Lender shall be conclusive.

     6.7. CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If after the date hereof any Lender or the
Administrative Agent determines that (a) the future adoption of or change in any
law, governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) regarding capital requirements for banks or bank
holding companies or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by
a Governmental Authority with appropriate jurisdiction, or (b) compliance by
such Lender or the Administrative Agent or any corporation controlling such
Lender or the Administrative Agent with any new or changed law, governmental
rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) of any such entity regarding capital adequacy, has the effect of
reducing the return on such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's commitment
with respect to any Loans to a level below that which such

<PAGE>

                                      -42-

Lender or the Administrative Agent could have achieved but for such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or the
Administrative Agent's then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy
and assuming full utilization of such entity's capital) by any amount deemed by
such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent to be material,
then such Lender or the Administrative Agent may notify the Borrower of such
fact. To the extent that the amount of such reduction in the return on capital
is not reflected in the Base Rate, the Borrower agrees to pay such Lender or (as
the case may be) the Administrative Agent for the amount of such reduction in
the return on capital as and when such reduction is determined within thirty
(30) days following presentation by such Lender or (as the case may be) the
Administrative Agent of a certificate in accordance with Section 6.8 hereof.
Each Lender shall allocate such cost increases among its customers in good faith
and on an equitable basis.

     6.8. CERTIFICATE. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts
payable pursuant to Sections 6.6 or 6.7 and a brief explanation of such amounts
which are due, submitted by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts are due
and owing.

     6.9. INDEMNITY. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold
each Lender harmless from and against any loss, or reasonable out-of-pocket cost
or expense (including loss of anticipated profits) that such Lender may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment of the
principal amount of or any interest on any Eurodollar Rate Loans as and when due
and payable, including any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees
payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain
its Eurodollar Rate Loans, (b) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing or
conversion after the Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Loan
Request, notice (in the case of all or any portion of the Term Loan pursuant to
Section 4.5.2) or a Conversion Request relating thereto in accordance with
Section 2.6 or Section 2.7 or Section 4.5 or (c) the making of any payment of a
Eurodollar Rate Loan or the making of any conversion of any such Loan to a Base
Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period
with respect thereto, including interest or fees payable by such Lender to
lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain any such Loans.

     6.10. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT.

            6.10.1. OVERDUE AMOUNTS. Overdue principal and (to the extent
     permitted by applicable law) interest on the Loans and all other overdue
     amounts payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall
     bear interest compounded monthly and payable on demand at a rate per annum
     equal to three percent (3.00%) above the rate of interest then applicable
     thereto (or, if no rate of interest is then applicable thereto, the Base
     Rate) until such amount shall be paid in full (after as well as before
     judgment).

            6.10.2. AMOUNTS NOT OVERDUE. During the continuance of a Default or
     an Event of Default the principal of the Loans not overdue shall, until
     such Default or Event of Default has been cured or remedied or such Default
     or Event of Default has been waived by the Required Lenders pursuant to
     Section 17.12, at the election of the Administrative Agent or the Required
     Lenders by written notice to the Borrower, bear interest at a rate per
     annum equal to two percent (2.00%) above the rate of interest otherwise
     applicable to

<PAGE>

                                      -43-

     such Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 2.5 and the Term Loan
     pursuant to Section 4.5, and if such Default or Event of Default results
     from failure to make a payment when due, then all principal of the Loans
     not overdue shall bear interest at the rate of interest applicable to
     overdue principal pursuant to Section 6.10.1 until such Default or Event of
     Default has been cured or remedied or such Default or Event of Default has
     been waived by the Required Lenders pursuant to Section 17.12.

     6.11. REPLACEMENT LENDER. Within thirty (30) days after (a) any Lender has
demanded compensation from the Borrower pursuant to Sections 6.2.2, 6.6 or 6.7
hereof, or (b) there shall have occurred a change in law with respect to any
Lender as a consequence of which it shall have become unlawful for such Lender
to make a Eurodollar Rate Loan on any Drawdown Date, as described in Section 6.5
hereof (any such Lender described in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) is
hereinafter referred to as an "Affected Lender "), the Borrower may request that
the Non-Affected Lenders acquire all, but not less than all, of the Affected
Lender's outstanding Loans and assume all, but not less than all, of the
Affected Lender's Commitment. If the Borrower so requests, the Non-Affected
Lenders may elect to acquire all or any portion of the Affected Lender's
outstanding Loans and to assume all or any portion of the Affected Lender's
Commitment. If the Non-Affected Lenders do not elect to acquire and assume all
of the Affected Lender's outstanding Loans and Commitment, the Borrower may
designate a replacement bank or banks, which must be reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent, to acquire and assume that portion of the outstanding
Loans and Commitment of the Affected Lender not being acquired and assumed by
the Non-Affected Lenders. The provisions of Section 16 hereof shall apply to all
reallocations pursuant to this Section 6.11, and the Affected Lender and any
Non-Affected Lenders and/or replacement banks which are to acquire the Loans and
Commitment of the Affected Lender shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, in accordance with the provisions of Section 16 hereof,
such Assignments and Acceptances and other instruments as are required pursuant
to Section 16 hereof to give effect to such reallocations. Any Non-Affected
Lenders and/or replacement banks which are to acquire the Loans and Commitment
of the Affected Lender shall be deemed to be Eligible Assignees for all purposes
of Section 16 hereof. On the effective date of the applicable Assignments and
Acceptances, the Borrower shall pay to the Affected Lender all interest accrued
on its Loans up to but excluding such date, along with any fees payable to such
Affected Lender hereunder up to but excluding such date.

                     7. COLLATERAL SECURITY AND GUARANTIES.

     7.1. COLLATERAL SECURITY.

            7.1.1. SECURITY OF BORROWER. The Obligations shall be secured by (a)
     a perfected first priority security interest (subject only to Permitted
     Liens entitled to priority under applicable law) in substantially all of
     the assets of the Borrower (other than Excluded Collateral), whether now
     owned or hereafter acquired, pursuant to the terms of the Security
     Documents to which the Borrower is a party, and (b) a perfected first
     priority pledge (subject only to Permitted Liens entitled to priority under
     applicable law) by the Borrower of one hundred percent (100%) of the
     Capital Stock of each of its direct Subsidiaries, pursuant to the terms of
     the Pledge Agreement to which it is a party; provided, however, that the
     Borrower shall in no event be required to pledge more than sixty-five
     percent (65%) of the shares of Voting Stock of any Subsidiary organized
     under

<PAGE>

                                      -44-

     the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States of America or a
     state or other subdivision of the United States of America.

            7.1.2. GUARANTIES AND SECURITY OF GUARANTORS. The Obligations shall
     also be guaranteed pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty by each Guarantor.
     The obligations of the Guarantors under the Guaranty shall be in turn
     secured by (a) a perfected first priority security interest (subject only
     to Permitted Liens entitled to priority under applicable law) in
     substantially all of the assets of each such Guarantor (other than Excluded
     Collateral), whether now owned or hereafter acquired, pursuant to the terms
     of the Security Documents to which such Guarantor is a party and (b) a
     perfected first priority pledge (subject only to Permitted Liens entitled
     to priority under applicable law) by such Guarantor of one hundred percent
     (100%) of the Capital Stock of each of its direct Subsidiaries, pursuant to
     the terms of the Pledge Agreement to which it is a party; provided,
     however, that each such Guarantor shall in no event be required to pledge
     more than sixty five percent (65%) of the shares of Voting Stock of any
     Subsidiary organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United
     States of America or a state or other subdivision of the United States of
     America.

     7.2. GUARANTY. Each Guarantor and the Borrower are members of a group of
related corporations, the success of any one of which is dependent in part on
the success of the other members of such group. Each Guarantor expects to
receive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the Loans advanced and
other credit extended to the Borrower by the Lenders pursuant to this Credit
Agreement (which benefits are hereby acknowledged). It is a condition precedent
to the Lenders' advancing Loans and Letters of Credit to the Borrower hereunder
that each Guarantor execute and deliver this Credit Agreement and guaranty the
Borrower's Obligations hereunder. Each Guarantor wishes to guaranty the
Borrower's obligations to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in
respect of the Credit Agreement and accordingly, each Guarantor hereby agrees
with the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as set forth in this Section 7.2.

            7.2.1. GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE.

            Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally guarantees to the
     Lenders and the Administrative Agent the full and punctual payment when due
     (whether at stated maturity, by required pre-payment, by acceleration or
     otherwise), as well as the performance, of all of the Obligations of the
     Borrower (referred to in this Section 7.2 as the "Borrower's Obligations"),
     including all such which would become due but for the operation of the
     automatic stay pursuant to Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and the
     operation of Sections 502(b) and 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. This
     Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full
     and punctual payment and performance of all of the Borrower's Obligations
     and not of their collectibility only and is in no way conditioned upon any
     requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender first attempt to
     collect any of the Borrower's Obligations from the Borrower or any other
     Guarantor or resort to any collateral security or other means of obtaining
     payment. Should the Borrower default in the payment or performance of any
     of the Borrower's Obligations, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder
     with respect to such Borrower's Obligations in default shall, upon demand
     by the Administrative

<PAGE>

                                      -45-

     Agent, become immediately due and payable to the Administrative Agent, for
     the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, without any other
     demand or notice of any nature, all of which are expressly waived by each
     Guarantor. Payments by each Guarantor hereunder may be required by the
     Administrative Agent on any number of occasions. All payments by each
     Guarantor hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, in the
     manner and at the place of payment specified therefor in this Credit
     Agreement, for the account of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent.

            7.2.2. GUARANTORS' AGREEMENT TO PAY ENFORCEMENT COSTS, ETC. Each
     Guarantor further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as a guarantor
     only, to pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, all costs and expenses
     (including court costs and legal expenses) incurred or expended by the
     Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the enforcement of
     this Guaranty, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this
     Section 7.2.2 from the time when such amounts become due until payment,
     whether before or after judgment, at the rate of interest for overdue
     principal set forth in this Credit Agreement, provided that if such
     interest exceeds the maximum amount permitted to be paid under applicable
     law, then such interest shall be reduced to such maximum permitted amount.

            7.2.3. WAIVERS BY GUARANTORS; LENDER'S FREEDOM TO ACT. Each
     Guarantor agrees that the Obligations will be paid and performed strictly
     in accordance with their respective terms, regardless of any law,
     regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction
     affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or
     any Lender with respect thereto. Each Guarantor waives promptness,
     diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance, notice of
     any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (except as
     specifically required by Section 7.2.2), all defenses which may be
     available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar
     law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of
     assets of the Borrower or any other entity or other person primarily or
     secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all
     suretyship defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the
     foregoing, each Guarantor acknowledges the provisions of this Credit
     Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents and agrees that the
     obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or
     discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure
     of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or
     to enforce any right or remedy against the Borrower or any other entity or
     other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the
     Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or
     renewals of any Obligation; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner
     of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescissions, waivers,
     compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications
     of any of the terms or provisions of this Credit Agreement, the Revolving
     Credit Notes, the Term Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other
     agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any
     of the Obligations, (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any
     entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation;
     (v) the adequacy of any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Lender
     may have against any collateral security or other means of obtaining
     repayment of any of the Obligations;

<PAGE>

                                      -46-

     (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the Obligations,
     including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any rights
     which the Administrative Agent or any Lender might have in such collateral
     security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or
     destruction of any such collateral security; or (vii) any other act or
     omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any
     Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of any Guarantor,
     all of which may be done without notice to any Guarantor. To the fullest
     extent permitted by law, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all
     rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any "one action" or
     "anti-deficiency" law which would otherwise prevent the Administrative
     Agent or any Lender from bringing any action, including any claim for a
     deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of
     set-off), against any Guarantor before or after the Administrative Agent's
     or such Lender's commencement or completion of any foreclosure action,
     whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or (B) any
     other law which in any other way would otherwise require any election of
     remedies by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

          7.2.4. UNENFORCEABILITY OF OBLIGATIONS AGAINST BORROWER. If for any
     reason the Borrower has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation
     to discharge any of the Borrower's Obligations, or if any of the Borrower's
     Obligations have become irrecoverable from the Borrower by reason of the
     Borrower's insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation
     of law or for any other reason, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding
     on each Guarantor to the same extent as if such Guarantor at all times had
     been the principal obligor on all such Obligations. In the event that
     acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Borrower's Obligations
     is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the
     Borrower, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to
     acceleration under the terms of this Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit
     Notes, the Term Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement
     evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any
     Obligation of the Borrower shall be immediately due and payable by each
     Guarantors.

            7.2.5. SUBROGATION; SUBORDINATION.

                   7.2.5.1. SUBROGATION. Until the indefeasible payment and
            performance in full of all of the Borrower's Obligations, no
            Guarantor shall exercise any rights against the Borrower arising as
            a result of payment by such Guarantor hereunder, by way of
            subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise,
            and will not prove any claim in competition with the Administrative
            Agent or any Lender in respect of any payment hereunder in any
            bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization case or proceedings of any
            nature; no Guarantor will claim any setoff, recoupment or
            counterclaim against the Borrower in respect of any liability of
            such Guarantor to the Borrower; and each Guarantor waives any
            benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security
            which may be held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender unless
            the same is released by the Administrative Agent or such Lender.

                   7.2.5.2. SUBORDINATION. The payment of any amounts due with
            respect to any indebtedness of the Borrower for money borrowed or
            credit received now or

<PAGE>

                                      -47-

            hereafter owed to each Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior
            payment in full of all of the Borrower's Obligations. Each Guarantor
            agrees that, during the continuance of any Default or Event of
            Default, no Guarantor will demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to
            collect any such indebtedness of the Borrower to such Guarantor
            until all of the Borrower's Obligations shall have been paid in
            full, provided, however, that ordinary course payments among the
            Borrower and the Guarantors shall be permitted. If, notwithstanding
            the foregoing sentence, any Guarantor shall collect, enforce or
            receive any amounts (other than ordinary course payments) in respect
            of such indebtedness in contravention of the foregoing while the
            Borrower's Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be
            collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for
            the Lenders, and the Administrative Agent and be paid over to the
            Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the
            Administrative Agent, on account of the Borrower's Obligations
            without affecting in any manner the liability of any Guarantor under
            the other provisions of this Guaranty.

                  7.2.5.3. PROVISIONS SUPPLEMENTAL. The provisions of this
            Section 7.2.5 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any
            rights and remedies of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
            under any separate subordination agreement which the Administrative
            Agent may at any time and from time to time enter into with any
            Guarantor for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative
            Agent.

            7.2.6. SETOFF. Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral security
     or other means of obtaining payment of any of the Borrower's Obligations,
     during the continuance of any Event of Default, each of the Administrative
     Agent and the Lenders is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
     time, without notice to any Guarantor (any such notice being expressly
     waived by each Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
     set off and apply any deposits and other sums credited by or due from the
     Administrative Agent or such Lender to any Guarantor or subject to
     withdrawal by such Guarantor against the obligations of any Guarantor under
     this Guaranty, whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall
     have made any demand under this Guaranty and although such obligations may
     be contingent or unmatured.

          7.2.7. NO RELIANCE. Each Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that such
     Guarantor itself has established its own adequate means of obtaining from
     the Borrower on a continuing basis all information desired by such
     Guarantor concerning the financial condition of the Borrower and that each
     Guarantor will look to the Borrower and not to the Administrative Agent or
     any Lender in order for such Guarantor to keep adequately informed of
     changes in the Borrower's financial condition.

          7.2.8. TERMINATION; REINSTATEMENT. This Guaranty shall remain in full
     force and effect until all of the Borrower's Obligations have been paid in
     full in cash and all commitments under this Credit Agreement have been
     terminated. This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,
     if at any time any payment made or value received with respect to any
     Borrower's Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be

<PAGE>

                                      -48-

     returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency,
     bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, or otherwise, all as though
     such payment had not been made or value received. Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, in the event that any Guarantor is sold in accordance with the
     provisions of Section 10.5.2.1 hereof, such Guarantor shall be released
     from its guaranty obligations hereunder and the Administrative Agent shall,
     upon the request of the Borrower,  terminate its security  interests in all
     of such Guarantor's rights, title and interest in and to the Collateral.

            7.2.9. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Guaranty shall be binding upon
     each Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit
     of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and their respective successors,
     transferees and assigns. No Guarantor may assign any of its obligations
     hereunder.

                       8. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

     The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent as follows:

     8.1. CORPORATE AUTHORITY.

            8.1.1. INCORPORATION; GOOD STANDING. Each of the Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries (a) is a corporation, limited liability company or limited
     partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
     laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, (b) has all
     requisite corporate (or the equivalent partnership or company) power to own
     its property and conduct its business as now conducted and as presently
     contemplated, and (c) is in good standing and duly authorized to do
     business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or limited
     partnership in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary
     (except where a failure to be in good standing or to be so qualified would
     not have a Material Adverse Effect).

            8.1.2. AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and performance by the
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of the Loan Documents to which such
     Person is or is to become a party and the transactions contemplated thereby
     (a) are within the corporate (or the equivalent partnership or company)
     authority of such Person, (b) have been duly authorized by all necessary
     corporate (or the equivalent partnership or company) proceedings of such
     Person, (c) do not and will not conflict with or result in any breach or
     contravention of any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation to which
     such Person is subject or any judgment, order, writ, injunction, license or
     permit applicable to such Person and (d) do not conflict with any provision
     of the Governing Documents of, or any agreement or other instrument binding
     upon, such Person (except in the case of clauses (c) and (d), where such
     conflict, breach or contravention would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
     and except as set forth on Schedule 8.1.2 hereof).

            8.1.3. ENFORCEABILITY. The execution and delivery by the Borrower or
     any of its Subsidiaries of the Loan Documents to which such Person is or is
     to become a party will result in valid and legally binding obligations of
     such Person enforceable against it in accordance with the respective terms
     and provisions thereof, except as enforceability is

<PAGE>

                                      -49-

     limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
     laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors'
     rights and (b) equitable principles.

     8.2. GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries of the Loan Documents to which such Person
is or is to become a party and the transactions contemplated thereby do not
require the approval or consent of, or filing with, any governmental agency or
authority other than those already obtained (except where the failure to obtain
such approval or consent or to make such filing would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, except for any necessary filing or recordation of or with
respect to any of the Security Documents, and except as set forth on Schedule
8.1.2 hereto).

     8.3. TITLE TO PROPERTIES; LEASES. Except as indicated on Schedule 8.3
hereto, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries own all of the assets reflected as
owned in the consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as
at the Interim Balance Sheet Date or acquired since that date (except property
and assets sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business
since that date), subject to no Liens or other rights of others, except
Permitted Liens.

     8.4. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS.

            8.4.1. FISCAL YEAR. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has a
     fiscal year which ends on the last Sunday in December of each calendar
     year, with fiscal month and fiscal quarter ends as set forth on Schedule
     8.4.1 through the later of the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date or the
     Term Loan Maturity Date.

            8.4.2. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. There has been furnished to each of the
     Lenders a consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
     as at the Balance Sheet Date and as at the Interim Balance Sheet Date, and
     a consolidated statement of income of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for
     the fiscal period then ended, and in the case of the consolidated balance
     sheet and consolidated statements of income of the Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries as at the Balance Sheet Date, certified by Deloitte & Touche
     LLP. Such balance sheets and statements of income have been prepared in
     accordance with GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects, the
     financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
     basis as at the close of business on the date thereof and the results of
     operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for
     the fiscal periods then ended, provided, that the statements prepared (a)
     as at the Balance Sheet Date and for the fiscal periods then ended were on
     an audited basis, and (b) as at the Interim Balance Sheet Date and for the
     fiscal period then ended were on an unaudited basis, without footnotes and
     are subject to normal year-end adjustments. There are no contingent
     liabilities of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet
     Date involving material amounts, known to the officers of the Borrower,
     which were not disclosed in such balance sheet or the notes related thereto
     and which were required under GAAP to be so disclosed.

            8.4.3. PROJECTIONS. The projections of the annual operating budgets,
     balance sheets and cash flow statements of the Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the 2002 to 2007 fiscal years,
     copies of which have been delivered to each

<PAGE>

                                      -50-

     Lender, disclose all material assumptions made with respect to financial
     and market conditions used in formulating such projections. To the
     knowledge of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, no facts exist as of
     the Closing Date that (individually or in the aggregate) would result in
     any material adverse change in any of such projections. The projections are
     based as of the date of this Credit Agreement upon reasonable estimates and
     assumptions, have been prepared on the basis of the assumptions stated
     therein and reflect as of the date of this Credit Agreement the reasonable
     estimates of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of the results of operations
     and other information projected therein.

     8.5. NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGES, ETC. Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date
there has been no event or occurrence which has had a Material Adverse Effect.
Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has made any Restricted Payment other than Restricted Payments
permitted under Section 10.4 hereof.

     8.6. FRANCHISES, PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, ETC. Except as disclosed on Schedule
8.6 hereto, the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries possesses or has the right
to use all franchises, patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, licenses
and permits, and rights in respect of the foregoing, adequate for the conduct of
its business substantially as now conducted without known conflict with any
rights of others (except where the failure to possess or have the right to use
any such franchises, patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, licenses,
permits or rights, or the existence of any such conflict, is not reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     8.7. LITIGATION. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.7 hereto, there are no
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations of any kind pending or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries before any Governmental Authority, that, (a) are reasonably likely

     8.10. TAX STATUS. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.10 hereto, the Borrower

     8.12. HOLDING COMPANY AND INVESTMENT COMPANY ACTS. Neither the Borrower nor

relating thereto.

     8.14. PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTEREST. All filings, assignments, pledges

substantially all of the Collateral. The Collateral and the Administrative
Agent's rights with respect to the Collateral are not subject to any setoff,
claims, withholdings or other defenses except for Permitted Liens and other
setoffs, claims, withholdings or defenses not to exceed $100,000 in the
aggregate at any one time. The Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower party to
one of the Security Agreements is the owner of the Collateral free from any
Lien, except for Permitted Liens.

     8.15. CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.15 hereto,
and except for arm's length transactions pursuant to which the Borrower or any

<PAGE>

                                      -52-

is presently a party to any transaction with any Affiliate of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Borrower or any Guarantor, and other
than for services as employees, officers and directors), including any contract,
agreement or other arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or
by, providing for rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise
requiring payments to or from any such Affiliate, or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower, with any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in which any
such Affiliate has a substantial ownership interest or is an officer, director,
trustee or partner.

     8.16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

            8.16.1. IN GENERAL. Each Employee Benefit Plan and each Guaranteed
     Pension Plan has been maintained and operated in compliance in all material
     respects with the provisions of ERISA and, to the extent applicable, the
     Code, including but not limited to the provisions thereunder respecting
     prohibited transactions and the bonding of fiduciaries and other persons
     handling plan funds as required by Section 412 of ERISA. The Borrower has
     heretofore delivered to the Administrative Agent the most recently
     completed annual report, Form 5500, with all required attachments, and
     actuarial statement required to be submitted under Section 103(d) of ERISA,
     with respect to each Guaranteed Pension Plan.

            8.16.2. TERMINABILITY OF WELFARE PLANS. No Employee Benefit Plan,
     which is an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section
     3(1) or Section 3(2)(B) of ERISA, provides benefit coverage subsequent to
     termination of employment, except as required by Title I, Part 6 of ERISA
     or the applicable state insurance laws. The Borrower may terminate each
     such Employee Benefit Plan at any time (or at any time subsequent to the
     expiration of any applicable bargaining agreement) in the discretion of the
     Borrower without liability to any Person other than for claims arising
     prior to termination. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any
     employment agreement between the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, on
     the one hand, and an employee, on the other hand, which requires the
     Borrower or such Subsidiary to extend health or welfare benefits through
     termination of employment.

            8.16.3. GUARANTEED PENSION PLANS. Each contribution required to be
     made to a Guaranteed Pension Plan, whether required to be made to avoid the
     incurrence of an accumulated funding deficiency, the notice or lien
     provisions of Section 302(f) of ERISA, or otherwise, has been timely made.
     No waiver of an accumulated funding deficiency or extension of amortization
     periods has been received with respect to any Guaranteed Pension Plan, and
     neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate is obligated to or has posted
     security in connection with an amendment to a Guaranteed Pension Plan
     pursuant to Section 307 of ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. No
     unpaid liability to the PBGC (other than required insurance premiums, all
     of which have been paid) in excess of $100,000 has been incurred by the
     Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate with respect to any Guaranteed Pension Plan
     and there has not been any ERISA Reportable Event (other than an ERISA
     Reportable Event as to which the requirement of thirty (30) days notice has
     been waived), or any other event or condition which presents a material
     risk of termination of any Guaranteed Pension Plan by the PBGC. Based on
     the latest valuation

<PAGE>

                                      -53-

     of each Guaranteed Pension Plan (which in each case occurred within twelve
     months of the date of this representation), and on the actuarial methods
     and assumptions employed for that valuation, the aggregate benefit
     liabilities of all such Guaranteed Pension Plans within the meaning of
     Section 4001 of ERISA did not exceed the aggregate value of the assets of
     all such Guaranteed Pension Plans by more than $100,000, disregarding for
     this purpose the benefit liabilities and assets of any Guaranteed Pension
     Plan with assets in excess of benefit liabilities.

            8.16.4. MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS. Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA
     Affiliate has incurred any unpaid liability (including secondary liability)
     in excess of $100,000 to any Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete
     or partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan under Section 4201 of
     ERISA or as a result of a sale of assets described in Section 4204 of
     ERISA. Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has been notified that
     any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or insolvent under and within
     the meaning of Section 4241 or Section 4245 of ERISA or is at risk of
     entering reorganization or becoming insolvent, or that any Multiemployer
     Plan intends to terminate or has been terminated under Section 4041A of
     ERISA, in each case if the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate could reasonably
     be expected to incur any liability in respect thereof in excess of
     $100,000.

     8.17. USE OF PROCEEDS.

            8.17.1. GENERAL. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used (a) to
     refinance the Indebtedness evidenced by the Existing Credit Agreement, (b)
     for Capital Expenditures, and (c) for working capital and general corporate
     purposes (including Permitted Acquisitions). The Borrower will obtain
     Letters of Credit solely for working capital and general corporate
     purposes.

            8.17.2. REGULATIONS U AND X. No portion of any Loan is to be used,
     and no portion of any Letter of Credit is to be obtained, for the purpose
     of purchasing or carrying any "margin security" or "margin stock" as such
     terms are used in Regulations U and X of the Board of Governors of the
     Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R. Parts 221 and 224.

            8.17.3. INELIGIBLE SECURITIES. No portion of the proceeds of any
     Loans is to be used, and no portion of any Letter of Credit is to be
     obtained, for the purpose of knowingly purchasing, or providing credit
     support for the purchase of, during the underwriting or placement period or
     within thirty (30) days thereafter, any Ineligible Securities underwritten
     or privately placed by a Financial Affiliate.

     8.18. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. The Borrower has taken all commercially
reasonable steps to investigate the past and present condition and usage of the
Real Estate and the operations conducted thereon and, based upon such
investigation, has determined that:

            (a)  except as set forth on Schedule 8.18 attached hereto, none of
     the Borrower, its Subsidiaries or any operator of the Real Estate or any
     operations thereon is in violation of any judgment, decree, order, law,
     license, rule or regulation pertaining to environmental matters, including
     without limitation, those arising under the Resource

     Effect;

            (b)  except as set forth on Schedule 8.18 attached hereto, neither
     the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice from any third

     any one of them has been identified by the United States Environmental

     other chemicals or substances regulated by any Environmental Laws
     ("Hazardous Substances") which any one of them has generated, transported
     or disposed of has been found at any site at which a Governmental Authority
     has conducted or has ordered that the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
     conduct a remedial investigation, removal or other response action pursuant

     party's incurrence of costs, expenses, losses or damages of any kind
     whatsoever in connection with the release of Hazardous Substances, in each
     case unless the matter referred to in such written notice would not have a
     Material Adverse Effect;

            (c)  except as set forth on Schedule 8.18 attached hereto and
     except where any untruth or inaccuracy of the representations and
     warranties set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph would not
     constitute a Material Adverse Effect: (i) no portion of the Real Estate has
     been used for the handling, processing, storage or disposal of Hazardous

charge upon any of its property; provided that any such tax, assessment, charge,
levy or claim need not be paid if the validity or amount thereof shall currently
be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and if the Borrower or
such Subsidiary shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect
thereto; and provided further that the Borrower and each Subsidiary of the
Borrower will pay all such taxes, assessments, charges, levies or claims

or required in order that the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may fulfill
any of its obligations hereunder or any of the other Loan Documents to which the

     substantial portion of the Collateral shall cease to be perfected, or shall
     cease to have the priority contemplated by the Security Documents, in each
     case otherwise than in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof or with
     the express prior written agreement, consent or approval of the Required
     Lenders, or any action at law, suit or in equity or other legal proceeding
     to cancel, revoke or rescind any of the Loan Documents shall be commenced
     by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries party thereto,
     or any court or any other governmental or regulatory authority or agency of
     competent jurisdiction shall make a determination that, or issue a
     judgment, order, decree or ruling to the effect that, any one or more of
     the Loan Documents is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any material
     respect against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with
     the terms thereof (other than as a result of the application of general
     principals of equity);

            (k)  the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate incurs any liability to
     the PBGC or a Guaranteed Pension Plan pursuant to Title IV of ERISA in an
     aggregate amount exceeding $1,000,000, or the Borrower or any ERISA
     Affiliate is assessed withdrawal liability pursuant to Title IV of ERISA by
     a Multiemployer Plan requiring aggregate annual payments exceeding
     $1,000,000, or any of the following occurs with respect to a Guaranteed
     Pension Plan: (i) an ERISA Reportable Event, or a failure to make a
     required installment or other payment (within the meaning of
     Section 302(f)(1) of ERISA), provided that such event (A) is reasonably
     likely to result in liability of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to
     the PBGC or such Guaranteed Pension Plan in an aggregate amount exceeding
     $1,000,000 and (B) is reasonably likely to constitute grounds for the
     termination of such Guaranteed Pension Plan by the PBGC, for the
     appointment by the appropriate United States District Court of a trustee to
     administer such Guaranteed Pension Plan or for the imposition of a lien in
     favor of such Guaranteed Pension Plan; or (ii) the appointment by a United
     States District Court of a trustee to administer such Guaranteed Pension
     Plan; or (iii) the institution by the PBGC of proceedings to terminate such
     Guaranteed Pension Plan;

            (l)  the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be enjoined,
     restrained or in any way prevented by the order of any Governmental
     Authority from conducting any material part of its business and such order
     shall continue in effect for more than fifteen (15) days;

            (m)  there shall occur any material damage to, or loss, theft or
     destruction of, any Collateral, whether or not insured, or any strike,
     lockout, labor dispute, embargo, condemnation, act of God or public enemy,

     (15) consecutive days, the cessation or substantial curtailment of revenue
     producing activities at any facility of the Borrower or any of its
     Subsidiaries if such event or circumstance is not covered by business
     interruption insurance and would have a Material Adverse Effect;

            (n)  there shall occur the loss, suspension or revocation of, or
     failure to renew, any license or permit now held or hereafter acquired by
     the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries if such loss, suspension,
     revocation or failure to renew would have a Material Adverse Effect;

            (o)  a Change of Control shall occur; or

            (p)  Joseph Micatrotto shall cease to be the President and Chief
     Executive Officer of the Borrower, and a successor President and Chief
     Executive Officer approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the
     Borrower shall not have been appointed within 60 days.

then, and in any such event, so long as the same may be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, by
notice in writing to the Borrower declare all amounts owing with respect to this
Credit Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents and all Reimbursement
Obligations to be, and they shall thereupon forthwith become, immediately due
and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; provided that in the
event of any Event of Default specified in Sections 14.1(g) or 14.1(h), all such
amounts shall become immediately due and payable automatically and without any
requirement of notice from the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

     14.2. TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS. If any one or more of the Events of
Default specified in Section 14.1(g) or Section 14.1(h) shall occur, any unused
portion of the credit hereunder shall forthwith terminate and each of the
Lenders shall be relieved of all further obligations to make Loans to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be relieved of all further
obligations to issue, extend or renew Letters of Credit. If any other Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may and,
upon the request of the Required Lenders, shall, by notice to the Borrower,
terminate the unused portion of the credit hereunder, and upon such notice being
given such unused portion of the credit hereunder shall terminate immediately
and each of the Lenders shall be relieved of all further obligations to make
Loans and the Administrative Agent shall be relieved of all further obligations
to issue, extend or renew Letters of Credit. No termination of the credit
hereunder shall relieve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any of the
Obligations.

     14.3. REMEDIES. In case any one or more of the Events of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, and whether or not the Lenders shall have
accelerated the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 14.1, each Lender, if
owed any amount with respect to the Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations, may
, with the consent of the Required Lenders but not otherwise, proceed to protect
and enforce its rights by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate
proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any
instrument pursuant to which the Obligations to such Lender are evidenced,
including as permitted by applicable law the obtaining of the ex parte
appointment of a receiver, and, if such amount shall have become due, by
declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the payment thereof or any other
legal or equitable right of such Lender. No remedy herein conferred upon any
Lender or the Administrative Agent or the holder of any Note or purchaser of any
Letter of Credit Participation is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy
and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
by statute or any other provision of law.

                                      -85-

     14.4. DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS. In the event that following the
occurrence or during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, receives any monies in connection with
the enforcement of any of the Security Documents, or otherwise with respect to
the realization upon any of the Collateral, such monies shall be distributed for
application as follows:

            (a)  First, to the payment of, or (as the case may be) the
     reimbursement of the Administrative Agent for or in respect of all
     reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses, disbursements and losses which
     shall have been incurred or sustained by the Administrative Agent in
     connection with the collection of such monies by the Administrative Agent,
     for the exercise, protection or enforcement by the Administrative Agent of
     all or any of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the
     Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan
     Documents or in respect of the Collateral or in support of any provision of
     adequate indemnity to the Administrative Agent against any taxes or liens
     which by law shall have, or may have, priority over the rights of the
     Administrative Agent to such monies;

            (b)  Second, to all other Obligations in such order or preference
     as the Required Lenders may determine; provided, however, that (i)
     distributions shall be made (A) pari passu among Obligations with respect
     to the Administrative Agent's fee described in the Fee Letter and all other
     Obligations and (B) with respect to each type of Obligation owing to the
     Lenders, such as interest, principal, fees and expenses, among the Lenders
     pro rata, and (ii) the Administrative Agent may in its discretion make
     proper allowance to take into account any Obligations not then due and
     payable;

            (c)  Third, upon payment and satisfaction in full or other
     provisions for payment in full satisfactory to the Lenders and the
     Administrative Agent of all of the Obligations, to the payment of any
     obligations required to be paid pursuant to Section 9-608(a)(1)(C) or
     9-615(a)(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code of the Commonwealth of
     Massachusetts; and

            (d)  Fourth, the excess, if any, shall be returned to the Borrower
     or to such other Persons as are entitled thereto.

                          15. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

     15.1. AUTHORIZATION.

            (a)  The Administrative Agent is authorized to take such action on
     behalf of each of the Lenders and to exercise all such powers as are
     hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents and any related
     documents delegated to the Administrative Agent, together with such powers
     as are reasonably incident thereto, including the authority, without the
     necessity of any notice to or further consent of the Lenders, from time to
     time to take any action with respect to any Collateral or the Security
     Documents which may be necessary to perfect, maintain perfected or insure
     the priority of the security interest in and liens upon the Collateral
     granted pursuant to the Security

<PAGE>

                                      -86-

     Documents, provided that no duties or responsibilities not expressly
     assumed herein or therein shall be implied to have been assumed by the
     Administrative Agent.

            (b)  The relationship between the Administrative Agent and each of
     the Lenders is that of an independent contractor. The use of the term
     "Administrative Agent" is for convenience only and is used to describe, as
     a form of convention, the independent contractual relationship between the
     Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders. Nothing contained in this
     Credit Agreement nor the other Loan Documents shall be construed to create
     an agency, trust or other fiduciary relationship between the Administrative
     Agent and any of the Lenders. The Syndication Agent shall have no duties or
     responsibilities as such under this Credit Agreement.

            (c)  As an independent contractor empowered by the Lenders to
     exercise certain rights and perform certain duties and responsibilities
     hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent is
     nevertheless a "representative" of the Lenders, as that term is defined in
     Article 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for purposes of actions for the
     benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent with respect to all
     collateral security and guaranties contemplated by the Loan Documents. Such
     actions include the designation of the Administrative Agent as "secured
     party", "mortgagee" or the like on all financing statements and other
     documents and instruments, whether recorded or otherwise, relating to the
     attachment, perfection, priority or enforcement of any security interests,
     mortgages or deeds of trust in collateral security intended to secure the
     payment or performance of any of the Obligations, all for the benefit of
     the Lenders and the Administrative Agent.

     15.2. EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS. The Administrative Agent may exercise its
powers and execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be
entitled to take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters
pertaining to its rights and duties under this Credit Agreement and the other
Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent may, in connection with its
administration of this Credit Agreement, utilize the services of such Persons as
the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may reasonably determine, and
all reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any such Persons shall be paid
by the Borrower.

     15.3. NO LIABILITY. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
shareholders, directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting
them in their duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall be liable for any
waiver, consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken,
in good faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents,
or in connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences
of any oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the Administrative
Agent or such other Person, as the case may be, may be liable for losses due to
its willful misconduct or gross negligence or its failure to comply with its
express obligations under this Agreement.

     15.4. NO REPRESENTATIONS.

            15.4.1. GENERAL. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible
     for the execution or validity or enforceability (other than by or in
     respect of the Administrative

<PAGE>

                                      -87-

     Agent) of this Credit Agreement, the Notes, the Letters of Credit, any of
     the other Loan Documents or any instrument at any time constituting, or
     intended to constitute, collateral security for the Notes, or for the value
     of any such collateral security or for the validity, enforceability or
     collectability of any such amounts owing with respect to the Notes, or for
     any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made herein or in
     any of the other Loan Documents (other than by or in respect of the
     Administrative Agent) or in any certificate or instrument hereafter
     furnished to it by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
     or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance
     (other than by or in respect of the Administrative Agent) of any of the
     terms, conditions, covenants or agreements herein or in any instrument at
     any time constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for
     the Notes or to inspect any of the properties, books or records of the
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent shall not be
     bound to ascertain whether any notice, consent, waiver or request delivered
     to it by the Borrower or any other holder of any of the Notes shall have
     been duly authorized or is true, accurate and complete. The Administrative
     Agent has not made nor does it now make any representations or warranties,
     express or implied, nor does it assume any liability to the Lenders, with
     respect to the credit worthiness or financial conditions of the Borrower or
     any of its Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
     independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
     other Lender, and based upon such information and documents as it has
     deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
     this Credit Agreement.

            15.4.2. CLOSING DOCUMENTATION, ETC. For purposes of determining
     compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 12, each Lender that
     has executed this Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to,
     approved or accepted, or to be satisfied with, each document and matter
     either sent, or made available, by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger
     to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or
     required thereunder to be consent to or approved by or acceptable or
     satisfactory to such Lender, unless an officer of the Administrative Agent
     or the Arranger active upon the Borrower's account shall have received
     notice from such Lender prior to the Closing Date specifying such Lender's
     objection thereto and such objection shall not have been withdrawn by
     notice to the Administrative Agent to such effect on or prior to the
     Closing Date.

     15.5. PAYMENTS.

            15.5.1. PAYMENTS TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. A payment by the Borrower
     to the Administrative Agent hereunder or any of the other Loan Documents
     for the account of any Lender shall constitute a payment to such Lender.
     The Administrative Agent agrees promptly to distribute to each Lender such
     Lender's pro rata share of payments received by the Administrative Agent
     for the account of the Lenders except as otherwise expressly provided
     herein or in any of the other Loan Documents.

            15.5.2. DISTRIBUTION BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. If in the opinion of
     the Administrative Agent the distribution of any amount received by it in
     such capacity hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the other Loan
     Documents might involve it

<PAGE>

                                      -88-

     in liability, it may refrain from making distribution until its right to
     make distribution shall have been adjudicated by a court of competent
     jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any
     amount received and distributed by the Administrative Agent is to be
     repaid, each Person to whom any such distribution shall have been made
     shall either repay to the Administrative Agent its proportionate share of
     the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the same in such
     manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.

            15.5.3. DELINQUENT LENDERS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
     contained in this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, any
     Lender that fails (a) to make available to the Administrative Agent its pro
     rata share of any Loan or to purchase any Letter of Credit Participation or
     (b) to comply with the provisions of Section 17.1 with respect to making
     dispositions and arrangements with the other Lenders, where such Lender's
     share of any payment received, whether by setoff or otherwise, is in excess
     of its pro rata share of such payments due and payable to all of the
     Lenders, in each case as, when and to the full extent required by the
     provisions of this Credit Agreement, shall be deemed delinquent (a
     "Delinquent Lender") and shall be deemed a Delinquent Lender until such
     time as such delinquency is satisfied. A Delinquent Lender shall be deemed
     to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the Borrower, whether
     on account of outstanding Loans, Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations,
     interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining nondelinquent Lenders for
     application to, and reduction of, their respective pro rata shares of all
     outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations. The Delinquent
     Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute such
     payments to the nondelinquent Lenders in proportion to their respective pro
     rata shares of all outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations.
     A Delinquent Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied in full a delinquency
     when and if, as a result of application of the assigned payments to all
     outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations of the nondelinquent
     Lenders, the Lenders' respective pro rata shares of all outstanding Loans
     and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations have returned to those in effect
     immediately prior to such delinquency and without giving effect to the
     nonpayment causing such delinquency.

     15.6. HOLDERS OF NOTES. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the
payee of any Note or the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation as the
absolute owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have
been furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent
holder, assignee or transferee.

     15.7. INDEMNITY. The Lenders ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold
harmless the Administrative Agent and its affiliates from and against any and
all claims, actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses,
damages, costs, reasonable expenses (including any expenses for which the
Administrative Agent or such affiliate has not been reimbursed by the Borrower
as required by Section 17.2), and liabilities of every nature and character
arising out of or related to this Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any of the
other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated or evidenced hereby or
thereby, or the Administrative Agent's actions taken hereunder or thereunder,
except to the extent that any of the same shall be directly caused by the
Administrative Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

<PAGE>

                                      -89-

     15.8. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AS LENDER. In its individual capacity, Fleet (or
any successor Administrative Agent) shall have the same obligations and the same
rights, powers and privileges in respect to its Commitment and the Loans made by
it, and as the holder of any of the Notes and as the purchaser of any Letter of
Credit Participations, as it would have were it not also the Administrative
Agent.

     15.9. RESIGNATION. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by
giving sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and the
Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right
to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. Unless a Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such successor Administrative
Agent (and any successor Administrative Agent appointed by the retiring
Administrative Agent as provided below) shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Borrower. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30)
days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation,
then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a financial institution having a
rating of not less than A or its equivalent by S&P. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative
Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent, as such, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations, as such, hereunder (other than those
duties and obligations accrued prior to such acceptance). After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation, the provisions of this Credit Agreement and
the other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
Administrative Agent.

     15.10. NOTIFICATION OF DEFAULTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT. Each Lender hereby
agrees that, upon learning of the existence of a Default or an Event of Default,
it shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof. The Administrative
Agent hereby agrees that upon receipt of any notice under this Section 15.10 it
shall promptly notify the other Lenders of the existence of such Default or
Event of Default.

     15.11. DUTIES IN THE CASE OF ENFORCEMENT. In case one of more Events of
Default have occurred and shall be continuing, and whether or not acceleration
of the Obligations shall have occurred, the Administrative Agent shall, if (a)
so requested by the Required Lenders and (b) the Lenders have provided to the
Administrative Agent such additional indemnities and assurances against expenses
and liabilities as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, proceed to
enforce the provisions of the Security Documents authorizing the sale or other
disposition of all or any part of the Collateral and exercise all or any such
other legal and equitable and other rights or remedies as it may have in respect
of such Collateral. The Required Lenders may direct the Administrative Agent in
writing as to the method and the extent of any such sale or other disposition,
the Lenders hereby agreeing to indemnify and hold the Administrative Agent,
harmless from all liabilities incurred in respect of all actions taken or
omitted in accordance with such directions, provided that the Administrative
Agent need not comply with any such direction to the extent that the
Administrative Agent reasonably believes

<PAGE>

                                      -90-

the Administrative Agent's compliance with such direction to be unlawful or
commercially unreasonable in any applicable jurisdiction.

                          16. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

     16.1. GENERAL CONDITIONS. The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (a) to an Eligible
Assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.2, (b) by way of
participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.4 or (c) by way of
pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of
Section 16.6 (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto
shall be null and void). Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto,
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the
extent provided in Section 16.4 and, to the extent expressly contemplated
hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders)
any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Credit
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

     16.2. ASSIGNMENT AND ACCESSIONS.

            16.2.1. ASSIGNMENTS. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or
     more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations
     under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
     and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (a) except in the
     case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
     Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or, in the case
     of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, the aggregate amount of
     the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding
     thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the
     principal outstanding balance of the Loan of the assigning Lender subject
     to each such assignment (determined as of the date on which the Assignment
     and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
     Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $2,500,000 unless each of the
     Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has
     occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consent (each such
     consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (b) each partial
     assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all
     the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement
     with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned, provided, however,
     that nothing contained herein shall restrict any Lender from making a non
     pro-rata assignment of its Loans; (c) any assignment of a Commitment must
     be approved by the Administrative Agent unless the Person that is the
     proposed assignee is itself a Lender with a Commitment (whether or not the
     proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (d)
     the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
     processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee, if it
     shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
     Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
     by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 16.3, from

<PAGE>

                                      -91-

     and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance,
     the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Credit Agreement
     and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
     Acceptance have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Credit
     Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
     interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
     obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment
     and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
     obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
     party hereto), provided that the assigning Lender shall continue to be
     entitled to the benefits of Sections 6.2.2, 6.6, 6.8, 6.9 and 17.3 with
     respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of
     such assignment and shall continue to be liable for obligations accrued
     prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer
     by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement that does
     not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Credit
     Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
     obligations in accordance with Section 16.4.

            16.2.2. ACCESSION BY LENDERS. Subject to the limitations contained
     herein, any one or more Lenders, or if the Lenders are unwilling to
     increase their Commitments by the amount requested by the Borrower, any
     other lender which would qualify as an Eligible Assignee but for any
     requirement in the definition thereof that such other lender be approved by
     the Administrative Agent (each such lender, an "Acceding Bank") may, at the
     request of the Borrower and with the consent of the Administrative Agent
     (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), become party to this
     Credit Agreement (in connection with an assignment pursuant to
     Section 16.2.1 or otherwise) or increase its Commitment hereunder, by
     entering into an Instrument of Accession in substantially the form of
     Exhibit F hereto (an "Instrument of Accession") with the Borrower and the
     Administrative Agent and assuming thereunder a Commitment, in an amount to
     be agreed upon by the Borrower, such Acceding Bank and the Administrative
     Agent (whose agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld), to make
     Revolving Credit Loans and participate in the risk relating to Letters of
     Credit pursuant to the terms hereof, and the Total Commitment shall
     thereupon be increased by the amount of such Acceding Bank's commitment (or
     increase in Commitment); provided, however, that (a) prior to the accession
     by any Acceding Bank, the Administrative Agent shall have received the
     audited financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the
     fiscal year ended on or nearest to December 31, 2002, (b) no Default or
     Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such
     accession, and (c) in no event shall the Total Commitment be increased
     under any one or more of such Instruments of Accession so as to exceed in
     the aggregate $35,000,000. On the effective date specified in any
     Instrument of Accession, Schedule 1 hereto shall be deemed to be amended to
     reflect (a) the name, address, Commitment and Commitment Percentage of such
     Acceding Bank, (b) the Total Commitment as increased by such Acceding
     Bank's Commitment, and (c) the changes to the other Lenders' respective
     Commitments (in the event a Lender is also the Acceding Bank) and
     Commitment Percentages resulting from such assumption and such increased
     Total Commitment.

     16.3. REGISTER. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as
an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement, notwithstanding
notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

     16.4. PARTICIPATIONS. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations
to any Person (other than a natural person) (each, a "Participant") in all or a
portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it);
provided that (a) such Lender's obligations under this Credit Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (b) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (c) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Credit Agreement and (d) except in the case the amount of
the participation is of the entire remaining amount of such Lender's Commitment
and the Loans at the time owing to it or, in the case the Participant is a
Lender or a Lender Affiliate, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for
this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable
Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loan
of the selling Lender subject to each such participation (determined as of the
date of the agreement or instrument pursuant to which the Lender sells such a
participation) shall not be less than $2,500,000 unless each of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consent (each such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided that
such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that
would reduce the principal of or the interest rate on any Loans, extend the term
or increase the amount of the Commitment of such Lender as it relates to such
Participant, reduce the amount of any Commitment Fee or Letter of Credit Fees to
which such Participant is entitled or extend any regularly scheduled payment
date for principal or interest. Subject to Section 16.5, the Borrower agrees
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 6.2.2, 6.6,
6.7 and 6.9 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to Section 16.2. To the extent permitted by law,
each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 17.1 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 17.1 as though it were a Lender.

     16.5. PAYMENTS TO PARTICIPANTS. A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Sections 6.2.2, 6.6 and 6.7 than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to

<PAGE>

                                      -93-

receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior
written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.2.2 unless the
Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
6.2.2 as though it were a Lender.

     16.6. MISCELLANEOUS ASSIGNMENT PROVISIONS. A Lender may at any time grant a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation (a)
any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to any of the twelve Federal
Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C.
Section 341 and (b) with respect to any Lender that is a Fund, to any lender or
any trustee for, or any other representative of, holders of obligations owed or
securities issued by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities or
any institutional custodian for such Fund or for such lender; provided that no
such grant shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder,
provide any voting rights hereunder to the secured party thereof, substitute any
such secured party for such Lender as a party hereto or affect any rights or
obligations of the Borrower or Administrative Agent hereunder. If the Reference
Lender transfers all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Credit
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall, in consultation with the Borrower and
with the consent of the Borrower and the Required Lenders, appoint another
Lender to act as a Reference Lender hereunder.

     16.7. ASSIGNEE OR PARTICIPANT AFFILIATED WITH THE BORROWER. If any
assignee Lender is an Affiliate of the Borrower, then any such assignee Lender
shall have no right to vote as a Lender hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents for purposes of granting consents or waivers or for purposes of
agreeing to amendments or other modifications to any of the Loan Documents or
for purposes of making requests to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 14.1 or Section 14.2, and the determination of the Required Lenders
shall for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents be
made without regard to such assignee Lender's interest in any of the Loans or
Reimbursement Obligations. If any Lender sells a participating interest in any
of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations to a Participant, and such Participant
is the Borrower or an Affiliate of the Borrower, then such transferor Lender
shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the sale of such
participation. A transferor Lender shall have no right to vote as a Lender
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents for purposes of granting
consents or waivers or for purposes of agreeing to amendments or modifications
to any of the Loan Documents or for purposes of making requests to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 to the extent that
such participation is beneficially owned by the Borrower or any Affiliate of the
Borrower, and the determination of the Required Lenders shall for all purposes
of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents be made without regard to
the interest of such transferor Lender in the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations
to the extent of such participation. The provisions of this Section 16.7 shall
not apply to an assignee Lender or participant which is also a Lender on the
Closing Date or to an assignee Lender or participant which has disclosed to the
other Lenders that it is an Affiliate of the Borrower and which, following such
disclosure, has been excepted from the provisions of this Section 16.7 in a
writing signed by the Required Lenders determined without regard

<PAGE>

                                      -94-

to the interest of such assignee Lender or transferor Lender, to the extent of
such participation, in Loans or Reimbursement Obligations.

     16.8. NEW NOTES. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by the parties to such assignment, together with each Note subject to such
assignment, the Administrative Agent shall (a) record the information contained
therein in the Register, and (b) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and
the Lenders (other than the assigning Lender). Within five (5) Business Days
after receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent, in exchange for each surrendered Note,
a new Note to the order of such assignee Lender in an amount equal to the amount
assumed by such assignee Lender pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and,
if the assigning Lender has retained some portion of its obligations hereunder,
a new Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the amount
retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall provide that they are
replacements for the surrendered Notes, shall be in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the surrendered Notes, shall
be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall
otherwise be in substantially the form of the assigned Notes. The surrendered
Notes shall be cancelled and returned to the Borrower.

                     17. PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICATIONS.

     17.1. SETOFF. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent and
each of the Lenders a continuing lien, security interest and right of setoff as
security for all Obligations, whether now existing or hereafter arising, upon
and against all deposits, credits, collateral and property, now or hereafter in
the possession, custody, safekeeping or control of the Administrative Agent or
such Lender or any Lender Affiliate and their successors and assigns or in
transit to any of them. Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral, if any of
the Obligations are due and payable and have not been paid or any Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any deposits or other sums
credited by or due from any of the Lenders to the Borrower and any securities or
other property of the Borrower in the possession of such Lender may be applied
to or set off by such Lender against the payment of Obligations. ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO REQUIRE ANY LENDER TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO
ANY OTHER COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THE OBLIGATIONS, PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS
RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS OR OTHER PROPERTY OF THE
BORROWER ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVED. Each of the
Lenders agrees with each other Lender that if such Lender shall receive from the
Borrower, whether by voluntary payment, exercise of the right of setoff,
counterclaim, cross action, enforcement of the claim evidenced by the Notes held
by, or constituting Reimbursement Obligations owed to, such Lender by
proceedings against the Borrower at law or in equity or by proof thereof in
bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, receivership or similar proceedings, or
otherwise, and shall retain and apply to the payment of the Note or Notes held
by, or Reimbursement Obligations owed to, such Lender any amount in excess of
its ratable portion of the payments received by all of the Lenders with respect
to the Notes held by, and Reimbursement Obligations owed to, all of the Lenders,
such Lender will make such disposition and arrangements with the other Lenders
with respect to such excess, either by way of distribution, pro tanto assignment
of claims, subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each Lender

<PAGE>

                                      -95-

receiving in respect of the Notes held by it or Reimbursement Obligations owed
it, its proportionate payment as contemplated by this Credit Agreement; provided
that if all or any part of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
Lender, such disposition and arrangements shall be rescinded and the amount
restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

     17.2. EXPENSES. The Borrower agrees to pay (a) the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs of producing and reproducing this Credit Agreement, the
other Loan Documents and the other agreements and instruments mentioned herein,
(b) the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of the Administrative
Agent's Special Counsel and any local counsel to the Administrative Agent
incurred in connection with the preparation, syndication, administration or
interpretation of the Loan Documents and other instruments mentioned herein,
each closing hereunder, any amendments, modifications, approvals, consents or
waivers hereto or hereunder, or the cancellation of any Loan Document upon
payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations or pursuant to any terms of
such Loan Document providing for such cancellation, (c) the other reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements of the Administrative Agent or any of
its affiliates incurred by the Administrative Agent or such affiliate in
connection with the preparation, syndication, administration or interpretation
of the Loan Documents and other instruments mentioned herein, including all
title insurance premiums and surveyor, engineering, appraisal and examination
charges, (d) any customary fees and bank charges, including bank charges for
returned checks, and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent in establishing, maintaining or handling agency accounts,
lock box accounts and other accounts for the collection of any of the
Collateral, (e) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, which attorneys may be
employees of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, and reasonable consulting,
accounting, appraisal, investment banking and similar professional fees and
charges) incurred by any Lender or the Administrative Agent in connection with
(i) the enforcement of or preservation of rights under any of the Loan Documents
against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the administration thereof
after the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default and (ii) subject to the
last sentence of Section 17.3 hereof, any litigation, proceeding or dispute
whether arising hereunder or otherwise in any way related to any Lender's or the
Administrative Agent's relationship with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
and (f) all reasonable expenses and disbursements of the Administrative Agent
incurred in connection with UCC searches, UCC filings, intellectual property
searches, intellectual property filings or mortgage recordings (including any
taxes associated therewith). The covenants contained in this Section 17.2 shall
survive payment or satisfaction in full of all other Obligations.

     17.3. INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Administrative Agent, its affiliates and the Lenders from and against any
and all claims, actions and suits whether groundless or otherwise, and from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, reasonable settlement costs
and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of every nature and character
arising out of this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby including, without limitation, (a) any actual
or proposed use by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of the proceeds of
any of the Loans or Letters of Credit, (b) the reversal or withdrawal of any
provisional credits granted by the Administrative Agent upon the transfer of
funds from lock box, bank agency, concentration

<PAGE>

                                      -96-

or any Subsidiary or in connection with the provisional honoring of funds
transfers, checks or other items, (c) any actual or alleged infringement of any
patent, copyright, trademark, service mark or similar right of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries comprised in the Collateral, (d) the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries entering into or performing this Credit Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents or (e) with respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
and their respective properties and assets, the violation of any Environmental
Law, the presence, disposal, escape, seepage, leakage, spillage, discharge,
emission, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substances or any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation brought or threatened with respect to
any Hazardous Substances (including, but not limited to, claims with respect to
wrongful death, personal injury or damage to property), in each case including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and
allocated costs of internal counsel incurred in connection with any such
investigation, litigation or other proceeding. In litigation, or the preparation
therefor, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and its affiliates shall be
entitled to select their own counsel and, in addition to the foregoing
indemnity, the Borrower agrees to pay promptly the reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel. If, and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrower
under this Section 17.3 are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby
agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment in satisfaction of such
obligations which is permissible under applicable law. The covenants contained
in this Section 17.3 shall survive payment or satisfaction in full of all other
Obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this Section
17.3 or in Section 17.2(e)(ii), the Borrower shall not be liable to the
Administrative Agent, any of its affiliates or any Lender for any claims,
actions, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, settlement costs, fees,
disbursements or expenses to the extent resulting from such Person's gross
negligence or willful misconduct or such Person's failure to comply with its
express obligations under this Agreement.

     17.4. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

            17.4.1. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Lenders and the Administrative
     Agent agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its affiliates, directors,
     officers, employees and representatives, to use reasonable precautions to
     keep confidential, in accordance with their customary procedures for
     handling confidential information of the same nature and in accordance with
     safe and sound banking practices, any non-public information supplied to it
     by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to or in connection
     with this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, provided
     that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any such information (a)
     after such information shall have become public other than through a
     violation of this Section 17.4, or becomes available to any of the Lenders
     or the Administrative Agent on a nonconfidential basis from a source other
     than the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) to the extent required by
     statute, rule, regulation or judicial process, (c) to counsel for any of
     the Lenders or the Administrative Agent, (d) to bank examiners or any other
     regulatory authority having jurisdiction over any Lender or the
     Administrative Agent, or to their auditors or accountants, (e) to the
     Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Financial Affiliate, (f) in
     connection with any litigation to which any one or more of the Lenders, the

<PAGE>

                                      -97-

     a Lender Affiliate or a Subsidiary or affiliate of the Administrative
     Agent, (h) to any actual or prospective assignee or participant or any
     actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or
     derivative transactions referenced to credit or other risks or events
     arising under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as
     such assignee, participant or counterparty, as the case may be, agrees to
     be bound by the provisions of Section 17.4 or (i) with the consent of the
     Borrower. Moreover, each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any
     Financial Affiliate is hereby expressly permitted by the Borrower to refer

     advertising, promotion or marketing undertaken by the Administrative Agent,
     such Lender or such Financial Affiliate and, for such purpose, the
     Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Financial Affiliate may utilize

     the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their businesses.

            17.4.2. PRIOR NOTIFICATION. Unless specifically prohibited by
     applicable law or court order, each of the Lenders and the Administrative
     Agent shall, prior to disclosure thereof, notify the Borrower of any

     in connection with an examination of the financial condition of such Lender
     by such governmental agency) or pursuant to legal process.

            17.4.3. OTHER. In no event shall any Lender or the Administrative
     Agent be obligated or required to return any materials furnished to it or
     any Financial Affiliate by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The
     obligations of each Lender under this Section 17.4 shall supersede and
     replace the obligations of such Lender under any confidentiality letter in
     respect of this financing signed and delivered by such Lender to the
     Borrower prior to the date hereof and shall be binding upon any assignee
     of, or purchaser of any participation in, any interest in any of the Loans
     or Reimbursement Obligations from any Lender.

     17.5. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, ETC. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made herein, in the Notes, in any of the other
Loan Documents or in any documents or other papers delivered by or on behalf of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant hereto shall be deemed to have
been relied upon by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, notwithstanding
any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by any of them, and shall survive
the making by the Lenders of any of the Loans and the issuance, extension or
renewal of any Letters of Credit, as herein contemplated, and shall continue in
full force and effect so long as any Letter of Credit or any amount due under
this Credit Agreement or the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents remains
outstanding or any Lender has any obligation to make any Loans or the
Administrative Agent has any obligation to issue, extend or renew any Letter of
Credit, and for such further time as may be otherwise expressly specified in
this Credit Agreement. All statements contained in any certificate or other

or recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special,
exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in
addition to, actual damages. The Borrower (a) certifies that no representative,
agent or attorney of any Lender or the Administrative Agent has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such Lender

                                     -100-

or the Administrative Agent would not, in the event of litigation, seek to
enforce the foregoing waivers and (b) acknowledges that each of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders has been induced to enter into this Credit
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party by, among other
things, the waivers and certifications contained herein.

     17.12. CONSENTS, AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC. Any consent or approval required
or permitted by this Credit Agreement to be given by the Lenders may be given,
and any term of this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other
instrument related hereto or mentioned herein may be amended, and the
performance or observance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any
terms of this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or such other
instrument or the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Borrower and the
written consent of the Required Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
amendment, modification or waiver shall:

            (a)  without the written consent of the Borrower and each Lender
     directly affected thereby:

                    (i)     reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loans
            or Reimbursement Obligations, or reduce the rate of interest on the
            Notes or the amount of the Commitment Fee or Letter of Credit Fees
            (other than as a result of (A) the waiver of the application of the
            default rate of interest pursuant to Section 6.10 which shall
            require only the approval of the Required Lenders or (B) a change in
            the definition of Leverage Ratio or any of the components thereof or
            the method of calculation thereof);

                    (ii)    increase the amount of such Lender's Commitment or
            extend the expiration date of such Lender's Commitment;

                    (iii)   postpone or extend the Revolving Credit Loan
            Maturity Date or the Term Loan Maturity Date or any other regularly
            scheduled dates for payments of principal of, or interest on, the
            Loans or Reimbursement Obligations or any Fees or other amounts
            payable to such Lender (it being understood that any change to the
            fiscal quarter ends of the Borrower which would have the effect of
            postponing or extending the date for any payment shall require the
            consent of each Lender affected thereby, and it being understood
            further that (A) a waiver of the application of the default rate of
            interest pursuant to Section 6.10, (B) any vote to rescind any
            acceleration made pursuant to Section 14.1 of amounts owing with
            respect to the Loans and other Obligations and (C) any modifications
            of the provisions relating to amounts, timing or application of
            prepayments of Loans and other Obligations, including under
            Sections 4.3.2, 4.3.3 and 4.3.4, shall require only the approval of
            the Required Lenders); and

                    (iv)    other than pursuant to a transaction permitted by
            the terms of this Credit Agreement (including but not limited to
            Sale/Leaseback Transactions and other Asset Sales permitted under
            Section 10.5.2.1) and as otherwise required by the terms of any of
            the Loan Documents, release all or substantially all of the

<PAGE>

                                     -101-

            Collateral or release all or substantially all of the Guarantors
            from their guaranty obligations under the Guaranties (excluding, if
            the Borrower or any Subsidiary of a Borrower becomes a debtor under
            the federal Bankruptcy Code, the release of "cash collateral", as
            defined in Section 363(a) of the federal Bankruptcy Code pursuant to
            a cash collateral stipulation with the debtor approved by the
            Required Lenders);

            (b)  without the written consent of all of the Lenders, amend or
     waive this Section 17.12 or the definition of Required Lenders;

            (c)  without the written consent of the Administrative Agent, amend
     or waive Section 15, the amount or time of payment of the Administrative
     Agent's Fee or any Letter of Credit Fees payable for the Administrative
     Agent's account or any other provision applicable to the Administrative
     Agent, as such.

No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or
impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing or delay or omission
on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right
shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto. No notice
to or demand upon the Borrower shall entitle the Borrower to other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

     17.13. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Credit Agreement are severable
and if any one clause or provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable
in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or
unenforceability shall affect only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in
such jurisdiction, and shall not in any manner affect such clause or provision
in any other jurisdiction, or any other clause or provision of this Credit
Agreement in any jurisdiction.
