SUBSTITUTE LENDER

4.4 (a) If any  Declining  Lender  delivers a Termination  Request,  the Account
        Party may  designate  by the date which falls no later than two Business
        Days before the end of the corresponding  Declining Lender Notice Period
        an  Approved  Credit  Institution  (which may be an  existing  Lender or
        Lenders) (the  SUBSTITUTE  LENDER) which is willing to assume all of the
        rights  and  obligations  of the  Declining  Lender  in  respect  of its
        participation  in the  relevant  Letter  of  Credit  (the OLD  LETTER OF
        CREDIT).

    (b) If the Account  Party has found a  Substitute  Lender it shall  promptly
        notify the Agent and the Declining Lender thereof and shall use its best
        efforts  to procure  the  release by Lloyd's of the Old Letter of Credit
        (an OLD  LETTER OF CREDIT  RELEASE)  from the  Funds at  Lloyd's  of the
        relevant Applicant.

    (c) The  Declining  Lender  shall as soon as  reasonably  practicable  after
        receipt  of notice  from the  Account  Party  transfer  its  rights  and
        obligations  hereunder to the Substitute  Lender in accordance  with the
        provisions of Clause 26.3 (TRANSFERS BY LENDERS).

    (d) The Substitute Lender shall pay to the Declining Lender all amounts then
        due and owing (and all fees  accrued to but  excluding  the date of such
        transfer) to the Declining Lender in respect of its participation in the
        Old Letter of Credit.

REPLACEMENT LETTERS OF CREDIT

4.5 (a) If a Substitute  Lender has become  party hereto  pursuant to Clause 4.4
        (SUBSTITUTE  LENDER),  then  subject  to the  provisions  of Clause  4.6
        (CONTINUATION  CONDITIONS  PRECEDENT) the Lenders who are deemed to have
        agreed to the  continuation  of the Old Letter of Credit (the  EXTENDING
        LENDERS) shall, together with the Substitute Lender, participate in, and
        issue as soon as reasonably practicable (on or immediately after the Old
        Letter of Credit  Release),  a new  Letter of Credit  (the NEW LETTER OF
        CREDIT)  which shall (i) replace the Old Letter of Credit and (ii) be in
        an amount equal to the Old Letter of Credit. If the New Letter of Credit
        has not been issued by the end of the Declining  Lender  Notice  Period,
        Clause 4.5(b) shall apply (on the  assumption,  if not the case,  that a
        Substitute  Lender  has not been found by the time  specified  in Clause
        4.4(a))  and the Agent  shall  promptly  deliver  a Lloyd's  Termination
        Notice (in accordance with Clause 4.3 (DECLINING LENDER MECHANICS)).

    (b) If a  Substitute  Lender  has not been  found by the time  specified  in
        Clause  4.4(a),  then the Account  Party  shall use its best  efforts to
        procure an Old Letter of Credit  Release,  and on or  immediately  after
        such Old  Letter of Credit  Release  (i)  subject to the  provisions  of
        Clause 4.6 (CONTINUATION  CONDITIONS  PRECEDENT),  the Extending Lenders
        shall participate in, and issue as soon as reasonably practicable, a new
        Letter of Credit (the REDUCED  LETTER OF CREDIT) which shall (x) replace
        their  participation in the Old Letter of Credit and (y) be in an amount
        equal to the Old  Letter of  Credit  LESS the  amount  of the  Declining
        Lender's  participation  and (ii) the Declining Lender shall participate
        in a separate  Letter of Credit (a  BILATERAL  LETTER OF  CREDIT)  which
        shall (x) replace its participation in the Old Letter of Credit,  (y) be
        in an amount equal to the Declining  Lender's  participation  in the Old
        Letter  of  Credit  and (z) have a Final  Expiration  Date  which is the
        Lloyd's  Termination  Date designated  pursuant to Clause 4.3 (DECLINING
        LENDER MECHANICS).

4.6 (a) On or prior to close of business on 1  September  of each year (each,  a
        CONTINUATION CP DATE), the Account Party shall promptly notify the Agent
        if (as of such Continuation CP Date):

      (i)   an Event of Default or  Potential  Event of Default  occurs which is
            continuing;

      (ii)  any of the  Representations  cease  to be  correct  in all  material
            respects, or become misleading in any material respect; or

      (iii) any  Letter  of  Credit  ceases  solely  to be used to  support  the
            relevant Applicant's underwriting business at Lloyd's which has been
            provided in accordance with the  requirements of Lloyd's  applicable
            to it.

    (b) If on any  Continuation  CP Date any of the events  specified  in Clause
        4.6(a) (each, a  CONTINUATION  CP EVENT) has occurred and is continuing,
        then at any time  thereafter  (so long as any  Continuation  CP Event is
        continuing):

      (i)   the Agent may,  and at the request of the  Majority  Lenders  shall,
            issue a Lloyd's Termination Notice (containing the earliest possible
            Lloyd's Termination Date); and

      (ii)  any Lender shall be entitled to issue a Lloyd's  Termination  Notice
            (containing the earliest possible Lloyd's Termination Date) and such

        (in the  case of  paragraph  (i)  above)  or (y)  receiving  a copy of a
        Lloyd's  Termination Notice from a Lender (in the case of paragraph (ii)
        above).

CANCELLATION OF BILATERAL LETTERS OF CREDIT

4.7 At any time after the issue of a  Bilateral  Letter of Credit by a Declining
Lender the Account  Party may give the Agent and the  Declining  Lender not less
than fourteen  days' prior  written  notice of its intention to procure that the
liability of the Declining Lender under such Letter of Credit is reduced to zero
(whereupon it shall do so).

REVISED LETTERS OF CREDIT

4.8 In the event that the Funds at Lloyd's  Requirements of an Applicant changes
at or around  the time of any given  Funds  Date in terms of amount  and/or  the
identity  of the  Applicant,  subject to the  approval of Lloyd's and subject to
each  Lender's LC Exposures  under the Letters of Credit  issued  hereunder  not
being  increased,  the Lenders shall co-operate with the Account Party to ensure
to the extent  reasonably  possible  that the Letters of Credit  provide for the
revised Funds at Lloyd's Requirements of the Applicants.

INCREASE TO FACILITY

4.9 If at any time a  Bilateral  Letter of Credit is  outstanding,  the  Account
Party  shall have the right to  increase  the size of the  Facility by up to the
principal amount of the Bilateral

<PAGE>

Letter of Credit(s)  outstanding  by  introducing  a new lender (which may be an
existing Lender) and on terms that one or more outstanding  Bilateral Letters of
Credit having an aggregate  principal  amount at least equal to the increase are
cancelled at the time the increase  takes effect.  Each Lender agrees to execute

consent of that Lender at the time such documentation is executed.

        receipt of such  demand)  (i) notify each of the Lenders and the Account
        Party by  facsimile  of such demand for payment and (ii) deliver to each
        Lender  and the  Account  Party a copy of each  document  purporting  to
        represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit.

    (b) With respect to any drawing properly made under a Letter of Credit, each
        Lender will make an LC  Disbursement in respect of such Letter of Credit
        in accordance  with its  liability  under such Letter of Credit and this
        Agreement,  such LC  Disbursement to be made to the account of the Agent
        most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders
        within two Business  Days of receipt of a demand for payment  under such
        Letter of Credit by the Agent;

    (c) The Agent will and undertakes to each Lender that it will:

      (i)   make  any  such  LC   Disbursement   available  to  Lloyd's  as  the
            beneficiary  of such  Letter  of Credit by  promptly  crediting  the
            amounts so received from the Lenders,  in like funds, to the account
            identified by Lloyd's in connection  with such demand for payment on

        Letter of Credit,  the Agent will  notify the  Account  Party of such LC
        Disbursement  provided  that any failure to give or delay in giving such
        notice  shall not  relieve  the  Account  Party of their  obligation  to
        reimburse the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

RIGHT TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT

5.2 Each Lender  shall be entitled  to make any payment in  accordance  with the

                                                                  Conformed Copy


LIABILITY OF LENDERS

5.3 Neither the Agent,  nor any Lender nor any of their  Related  Parties  shall
have any  liability or  responsibility  by reason of or in  connection  with the
issuance  or  transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make
any payment thereunder  (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in
the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,  interruption, loss or delay in
transmission or delivery of any draft,  notice or other  communication  under or
relating  to any Letter of Credit  (including  any  document  required to make a
drawing  thereunder),  any error in  interpretation  of  technical  terms or any
consequence  arising  from  causes  beyond  their  control;  provided  that  the
foregoing  shall not be construed to excuse the Agent or a Lender from liability
to any Obligor to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to  consequential
damages,  claims in respect of which are hereby  waived by the  Obligors  to the
extent  permitted by applicable  Law) suffered by any Obligor that are caused by
the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent or a Lender.  The parties
hereto expressly agree that:

(a)   the  Agent  may  accept  documents  that  appear  on  their  face to be in
      substantial  compliance  with  the  terms of a Letter  of  Credit  without
      responsibility  for  further  investigation,  regardless  of any notice or
      information  to the contrary,  and may make payment upon  presentation  of
      documents that appear on their face to be in substantial  compliance  with
      the terms of such Letter of Credit;

(b)   the Agent  shall have the  right,  in its sole  discretion,  to decline to
      accept such  documents and to make such payment if such  documents are not
      in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and

(c)   this Clause  shall  establish  the standard of care to be exercised by the
      Agent when determining  whether drafts and other documents presented under
      a Letter of Credit comply with the terms  thereof (and the parties  hereto
      hereby waive,  to the extent  permitted by applicable Law, any standard of
      care inconsistent with the foregoing).

6.    THE ACCOUNT PARTY'S LIABILITIES IN RELATION TO LETTERS OF CREDIT

THE ACCOUNT PARTY'S INDEMNITY TO LENDERS

6.1 The  Account  Party  shall  irrevocably  and  unconditionally  as a  primary
obligation  indemnify  (on demand by the Agent (and any Lender may  require  the
Agent to make such demand)) each Lender against:

(a)   any LC Disbursement  paid or payable by such Lender in accordance with the
      terms of any Letter of Credit requested by the Account Party; and

(b)   all liabilities,  reasonable costs  (including,  without  limitation,  any
      costs  incurred in funding any amount  which falls due from such Lender in
      connection  with such Letter of  Credit),  claims,  losses and  reasonable
      expenses  which such Lender may at any time  properly  incur or sustain in
      connection with any Letter of Credit.

the rights,  powers and remedies conferred on any Lender by this Agreement or by
Law shall be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected by:

(a)   the winding-up,  dissolution,  administration  or  re-organisation  of any
      Lender or any other person or any change in its status, function,  control
      or ownership;

(b)   any of the  obligations  of any Lender or any other  person  hereunder  or
      under any Letter of Credit or under any other security taken in respect of
      the Account Party's obligations  hereunder or otherwise in connection with
      any Letter of Credit being or becoming illegal, invalid,  unenforceable or
      ineffective in any respect;

(c)   time or other  indulgence  being  granted  or agreed to be  granted to any
      Lender or any other  person in respect  of its  obligations  hereunder  or
      under or in  connection  with any Letter of Credit or under any such other
      security;

(d)   any amendment to, or any  variation,  waiver or release of, any obligation
      of any  Lender or any  other  person  under  any  Letter of Credit or this
      Agreement;

(e)   any  other  act,  event or  omission  which,  but for this  Clause 6 might
      operate to discharge, impair or otherwise affect any of the obligations of
      the Account Party set out in this Clause 6 or any of the rights, powers or
      remedies conferred upon any Lender by this Agreement or by Law.

The  obligations  of the  Account  Party  set out in this  Clause  6 shall be in
addition to and  independent of every other security which any Lender may at any
time hold in respect of the Account Party's obligations hereunder.

SETTLEMENT CONDITIONAL

6.3 Any settlement or discharge  between the Account Party and a Lender shall be
conditional  upon no security or payment to such Lender by the Account  Party or
any other  person on behalf of the Account  Party,  being  avoided or reduced by
virtue of any Laws relating to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  liquidation or similar
Laws of general  application  and, if any such security or payment is so avoided
or reduced, such Lender shall be entitled to recover the value or amount of such
security or payment from the Account Party subsequently as if such settlement or
discharge had not occurred.

7.    DEFAULT INTEREST

A Demand  Amount  shall bear  interest  during  each  Default  Period in respect
thereof,  and any other amount unpaid  hereunder shall bear interest for so long
as it remains outstanding at rate of the sum of (i) two per cent. per annum (ii)
the Mandatory Costs in respect thereof at such time, and (iii) LIBOR on each day
whilst such amount  remains  outstanding.  Such interest shall be payable by the
Account Party on the date on which it reimburses the Lenders under Clause 6.1(a)
and (b) (THE ACCOUNT PARTY'S INDEMNITY TO LENDERS).

8.    TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF THE COMMITMENTS

SCHEDULED TERMINATION

8.1 Unless previously terminated,  the unutilised Commitments shall terminate at
the close of business on the Commitment Termination Date.

Account  Party  shall  not  cancel  or reduce  the  Commitments  if the Total LC
Exposures would exceed the Total Commitments.

8.3 The Account Party shall notify the Agent of any election to cancel or reduce
the Total Commitments under Clause 8.2 at least three Business Days prior to the
effective date of such  cancellation or reduction,  specifying such election and

shall advise the Lenders of the contents  thereof.  Each notice delivered by the
Account  Party  pursuant to this Clause shall be  irrevocable;  provided  that a
notice of  cancellation  of the  Commitments  delivered by the Account Party may

ADJUSTMENT OF LETTER OF CREDIT FEE

9.3 (a) Notwithstanding  Clause 9.2(a) above, when the Financial Strength Rating
        (as defined below) corresponds to a rating set out in Column 1 or Column
        2 below of the fee chart  (the FEE  CHART),  the  Letter  of Credit  Fee
        payable in accordance with Clause 9.2 shall be the amount set out in the
        corresponding row in Column 3 of the Fee Chart;  provided however,  that
        whilst AMB Cash  Collateral is posted in compliance  with the provisions
        of Clause  19.8  (RATINGS  DOWNGRADE)  the Letter of Credit Fee shall be
        0.30 per cent. per annum.  Upon any AMB Cash  Collateral  which has been
        posted being fully released, in each case in compliance with Clause 19.8

        the conditions set forth in Clause 19.8(a) or (b) are not satisfied, the
        day on which the provisions of Clause 19.8 (RATINGS DOWNGRADE) have been
        complied with.

    (c) In this Clause 9.3 and in Clause 19.8,  FINANCIAL  STRENGTH RATING means
        the lower of:

      (i)   the financial-strength  rating of the Account Party from A.M. Best &
            Co. (or its successor); and

      (ii)  the lower of the  financial-strength  rating from  Standard & Poor's
            Rating Services (or its successor) of XL Bermuda and XL Re.

        In the event that  either A.M.  Best & Co. or Standard & Poor's  Ratings
        Services  changes  the  designation  of its ratings  (including  without
        limitation  by  increasing  the number of ratings  available  or notches
        within  ratings),  then the Agent and all the Lenders shall negotiate in
        good faith such amendments to this Clause 9.3 as are necessary to ensure
        that (in the opinion of the Lenders, acting reasonably) the Letter

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


        of Credit Fees payable  relative to the strength of the relevant  rating
        are the same as they are on the date hereof.

COMMITMENT FEE

9.4 (a) The Account  Party shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender
        a fee computed at the rate of 33 per cent.  per annum of the  applicable
        Letter  of  Credit  Fee  from  time to time on that  Lender's  Available
        Commitment for the Availability Period.

    (b) The  accrued  commitment  fee is  payable  quarterly  in arrears on each
        Quarterly Date during the  Availability  Period,  on the last day of the
        Availability  Period and, if cancelled in full, on the cancelled  amount
        of the relevant  Lender's  Commitment  at the time the  cancellation  is
        effective.

AGENT FEES

9.5 The  Account  Party  agrees to pay to the Agent,  for its own  account,  the
agency fees payable in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter.

PAYMENT OF FEES

9.6 All fees payable  hereunder  shall be paid on the dates due, in  immediately
available  funds,  to the Agent for  distribution,  in the case of the Letter of
Credit Fees referred to in Clause 9.2 and the  commitment fee referred in Clause
9.4, to the Lenders  entitled  thereto.  Fees paid shall not be refundable under
any  circumstances  absent  manifest error in the calculation or payment of fees
due and payable.

BASIS OF CALCULATION

9.7 The fees payable pursuant to Clauses 9.1, 9.2 and 9.4 shall be calculated on
the basis of actual days elapsed and a 365 day year.

10.   TAXES

TAX GROSS-UP

10.1 All  payments  to be made by an Obligor  to any  Finance  Party  hereunder,
whether in respect of principal, interest, fees or any other item, shall be made
free and clear of and  without  deduction  for or on account of tax unless  such
Obligor  is  required  to  make  such a  payment  subject  to the  deduction  or
withholding of tax, in which case the sum payable by such Obligor (in respect of
which such  deduction or  withholding is required to be made) shall be increased
to the extent  necessary to ensure that such Finance Party receives a sum net of
any deduction or  withholding  equal to the sum which it would have received had
no such deduction or withholding been made or required to be made.

TAX INDEMNITY

10.2 Without  prejudice to Clause 10.1 (TAX  GROSS-UP),  if any Finance Party is
required  to make any  payment of or on account of tax on or in  relation to any
sum received or receivable  hereunder  (including any sum deemed for purposes of
tax to be received or  receivable  by such Finance Party whether or not actually
received or  receivable)  or if any  liability in respect of any such payment is
asserted,  imposed,  levied or assessed  against any Finance Party,  the Account
Party shall,  upon demand of the Agent,  promptly  indemnify  the Finance  Party
which

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


suffers a loss or  liability  as a result  against  such  payment or  liability,
together with any interest, penalties, costs and expenses payable or incurred in
connection therewith, PROVIDED THAT this Clause 10.2 shall not apply to:

(a)   any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net income  actually
      received or receivable by such Finance Party by the  jurisdiction in which
      such Finance Party is incorporated; or

(b)   any tax imposed on and  calculated  by  reference to the net income of the
      Facility  Office of such Finance Party actually  received or receivable by
      such Finance  Party by the  jurisdiction  in which its Facility  Office is
      located; or

(c)   the extent a loss,  liability or cost is  compensated  for by an increased
      payment under Clause 10.1 (TAX GROSS-UP).

CLAIMS BY LENDERS

10.3 A Lender  intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 10.2 (TAX INDEMNITY)
shall promptly notify the Agent of the event giving rise to the claim, whereupon
the Agent shall promptly notify the Account Party thereof.

11.   TAX RECEIPTS

NOTIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT TO DEDUCT TAX

11.1 If, at any time,  an Obligor is  required by Law to make any  deduction  or
withholding  from any sum payable by it hereunder (or if thereafter there is any
change  in the  rates  at which  or the  manner  in  which  such  deductions  or
withholdings are calculated),  such Obligor shall promptly,  upon becoming aware
of the same, notify the Agent.

EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT OF TAX

11.2 If an  Obligor  makes  any  payment  hereunder  in  respect  of which it is
required  to make any  deduction  or  withholding,  it shall pay the full amount
required to be deducted or withheld to the relevant  taxation or other authority
within the time allowed for such payment under  applicable Law and shall deliver
to the Agent for each Lender,  within thirty days after it has made such payment
to the applicable  authority,  an original receipt (or a certified copy thereof)
issued by such authority evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts
so required to be deducted or withheld in respect of that Lender's share of such
payment.

TAX CREDIT PAYMENT

11.3 If an additional  payment is made under Clause 10 (TAXES) by an Obligor for
the benefit of any Finance Party and such Finance Party, in its sole discretion,
determines  that it has obtained  (and has derived full use and benefit  from) a
credit  against,  a relief or remission  for, or repayment of, any tax, then, if
and to the extent that such Finance Party, in its sole opinion, determines that:

(a)   such credit, relief, remission or repayment is in respect of or calculated
      with  reference  to the  additional  payment  made  pursuant  to Clause 10
      (TAXES); and

(b)   its tax affairs for its tax year in respect of which such credit,  relief,
      remission or repayment was obtained have been finally settled,

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


such Finance Party shall,  to the extent that it can do so without  prejudice to
the retention of the amount of such credit, relief,  remission or repayment, pay
to such Obligor such amount as such Finance  Party shall,  in its sole  opinion,
determine  to be the amount  which will leave such  Finance  Party  (after  such
payment)  in no worse  after-tax  position  than it would  have  been in had the
additional payment in question not been required to be made by such Obligor.

TAX CREDIT CLAWBACK

11.4 If any Finance  Party  makes any  payment to an Obligor  pursuant to Clause
11.3 (TAX CREDIT PAYMENT) and such Finance Party subsequently determines, in its
sole  opinion,  that the credit,  relief,  remission  or repayment in respect of
which such payment was made was not  available or has been  withdrawn or that it
was unable to use such credit,  relief,  remission  or  repayment  in full,  the
Obligor  shall  reimburse  such Finance  Party such amount as such Finance Party
determines,  in its sole opinion, is necessary to place it in the same after-tax
position as it would have been in if such credit, relief, remission or repayment
had been obtained and fully used and retained by such Finance Party.

TAX AND OTHER AFFAIRS

11.5 No  provision  of this  Agreement  shall  interfere  with the  right of any
Finance  Party to arrange  its tax or any other  affairs in  whatever  manner it
thinks fit, oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit,  relief,  remission or
repayment in respect of any payment under Clause 10.1 (TAX GROSS-UP) in priority
to any other credit,  relief,  remission or repayment available to it nor oblige
any  Finance  Party to  disclose  any  information  relating to its tax or other
affairs or any computations in respect thereof.

12.   INCREASED COSTS

INCREASED COSTS

12.1 Subject to Clause 12.2  (EXCEPTIONS),  if after the date of this Agreement,
the result of:

(a)   the   introduction   of  or  any  change  in  the   official  or  judicial
      interpretation  or  application  of any Law (having the force of law or if
      not  having  the  force of law,  generally  complied  with by a Lender  in
      relation to any relevant jurisdiction); and/or

(b)   compliance (without adopting materially less prudent policies or standards
      than  those  previously  adopted  by it) by any  Lender or by the  holding
      company of any Lender with any of the matters  mentioned in paragraph  (a)
      above,

including in each case, without limitation, those Laws relating to Taxation, any
change in  currency,  any reserve,  special  deposit,  cash ratio,  liquidity or
capital adequacy  requirement or any other form of banking or monetary controls,
is that:

      (i)   a Lender  or its  holding  company  incurs an  additional  cost as a
            result of that Finance Party having  entered  into,  or  performing,
            maintaining or funding its obligations under this Agreement; or

      (ii)  a Lender or its holding company incurs an additional cost in making,
            funding or  maintaining  any Letters of Credit made or to be made by
            it under this Agreement; or

      (iii) any amount  payable to a Lender or the effective  return to a Lender
            under  this  Agreement  or the  effective  return to a Lender or its
            holding  company on its

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


            capital is reduced as a result of any change in the amount or nature
            of the capital  resources  required to be  allocated in respect of a
            Lender's participation under this Agreement; or

      (iv)  a Lender  makes any payment or foregoes any interest or other return
            on or calculated  by reference to any amount  received or receivable
            by it from the Account Party or the Agent under this Agreement;

            then and in each such case:

            (A)   the Lender shall notify the Account Party through the Agent of
                  the relevant  event  promptly upon becoming aware of the event
                  giving  details of any costs or amount  likely to be  demanded
                  under paragraph (B);

            (B)   promptly following any demand from time to time by that Lender
                  through the Agent,  the  Account  Party shall pay to the Agent
                  for the account of that Finance Party (or, as the case may be,
                  its  holding  company)  such amount as shall  compensate  such
                  Finance Party or its holding company for the additional  cost,
                  reduction, payment or foregone interest or other return.

EXCEPTIONS

12.2 Clause 12.1 shall not apply to or in respect of:

(a)   any circumstances referred to in Clause 10.2 (TAX INDEMNITY);

(b)   any  circumstances  for which a relevant  Lender has been  compensated for
      under Clause 11.3 (TAX CREDIT PAYMENT).

13.   ILLEGALITY

If,  after the date of this  Agreement,  any Change in Law or in the official or
judicial  interpretation  or  application  thereof  shall  make it  unlawful  or
contrary to an official  directive  in any  jurisdiction  for any Lender to make
available  or  fund  or  maintain  or to  give  effect  to  its  obligations  as
contemplated by this Agreement or the Letters of Credit (or, by reason only of a
Change of Law,  the Lender  ceases to be an Approved  Credit  Institution),  the
Lender shall  promptly on becoming  aware of the same give notice thereof to the
Account Party through the Agent, whereupon:

(a)   where such change  makes it unlawful or contrary to an official  directive
      to maintain or give effect to its obligations under this Agreement, if the
      Agent on behalf of such Lender so requires,  the Account Party shall by no
      later than the last day of any  applicable  grace period  specified by the
      applicable  Law ensure that the  liabilities  of such  Lender  under or in
      respect of each  Letter of Credit  are  cancelled  within  the  meaning of
      Clause  1.2(l)(i)(A)  (or  use  its  best  efforts  to  ensure  that  such
      liabilities are cancelled within the meaning of Clause 1.2(l)(i)(C)),  the
      Commitment  of that Lender shall  forthwith  be cancelled  and the Account
      Party shall prepay  forthwith fees,  costs and expenses due to that Lender
      hereunder;

(b)   where such  change  only makes it  unlawful  or  contrary  to an  official
      directive  to  participate  in  further   Letters  of  Credit  under  this
      Agreement,  then upon receipt by the Agent of that notice,  the  Available
      Commitment of that Lender shall be reduced to

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


      zero,  and  upon  the  expiry  of each  Letter  of  Credit  in which it is
      participating at such time, its resulting Available  Commitment shall also
      be  cancelled,  provided  that if the  Lender  subsequently  transfers  or
      assigns its rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement to a new lender
      pursuant to Clause 26.5 (RIGHTS TO SUBSTITUTE A SINGLE BANK),  the Account
      Party  may by  notice to the Agent  increase  the  Commitment  of such new
      lender  by the  amount of the  Available  Commitment  that was  previously
      cancelled.

14.   MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

DESIGNATION OF A DIFFERENT LENDING OFFICE

14.1 If any Lender requests  compensation  under Clause 12 (INCREASED COSTS), or
if the Account Party is required to pay any  additional  amount to any Lender or
any  Governmental  Authority  for  account of any Lender  pursuant  to Clause 10
(TAXES),  then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending  office for  funding or booking its  Letters of Credit  hereunder  or to
transfer  its  rights and  obligations  hereunder  to  another  of its  offices,
branches or  Affiliates,  if, in the  reasonable  judgment of such Lender,  such
designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant
to Clause 12 (INCREASED COSTS) or 10 (TAXES),  as the case may be, in the future
and (b) would not subject  such Lender to any  unreimbursed  cost or expense and
would not otherwise be  disadvantageous to such Lender. The Account Party hereby
agrees  to pay all  reasonable  costs and  expenses  incurred  by any  Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS

14.2 If any Lender requests  compensation  under Clause 12 (INCREASED COSTS), or
if any Account Party is required to pay any  additional  amount to any Lender or
any  Governmental  Authority  for  account of any Lender  pursuant  to Clause 10
(TAXES),  or if any Lender  defaults in its obligation to make LC  Disbursements
hereunder,  or if any Lender ceases to be an Approved Credit  Institution,  then
the  Account  Party may, at its sole  expense  and  effort,  upon notice to such
Lender and the  Agent,  require  such  Lender to assign  and  delegate,  without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Clause
26.5  (RIGHT TO  SUBSTITUTE  SINGLE  LENDER)),  all its  interests,  rights  and
obligations  under this Agreement to an Approved Credit  Institution  that shall
assume such  obligations  (which  assignee  may be another  Lender,  if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that:

(a)   the Account  Party shall have  received the prior  written  consent of the
      Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld;

(b)   such  Lender  shall  have  received  payment  of an  amount  equal  to the
      outstanding  amount of its LC  Disbursements,  accrued  interest  thereon,
      accrued  fees and all other  amounts  payable  to it  hereunder,  from the
      assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest
      and  fees)  or the  relevant  Account  Party  (in the  case  of all  other
      amounts); and

(c)   in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
      under Clause 12 (INCREASED COSTS) or payments required to be made pursuant
      to Clause 10 (TAXES),  such  assignment will result in a reduction in such
      compensation or payments.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such  assignment  and  delegation if,
prior  thereto,  as a result  of a  waiver  by such  Lender  or  otherwise,  the
circumstances  entitling the relevant  Account Party to require such  assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

15.   PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF SET-OFFS.

PAYMENTS BY THE ACCOUNT PARTY

15.1 (a) The Account  Party shall make each payment  required to be made by them
         hereunder  or under any other  Finance  Document  (except to the extent
         otherwise  provided  therein)  in  Sterling  on the date when  due,  in
         immediately  available  cleared funds,  without set-off or counterclaim
         (and in the case of  payments  required  pursuant to Clause 6, by 11.00
         a.m. on the due date). Any amounts received after such time on any date
         may, in the discretion of the Agent, be deemed to have been received on
         the  next  succeeding  Business  Day for the  purposes  of  calculating
         interest  thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Agent at the
         account  most  recently  notified by it,  except  payments  pursuant to
         Clauses 12 (INCREASED  Costs), 10 (TAXES),  24 (COSTS AND EXPENSES) and
         25 (INDEMNITIES),  which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled
         thereto.  The Agent shall  distribute any such payments  received by it
         for account of any other Person to the appropriate  recipient  promptly
         following receipt thereof.

     (b) If any payment  hereunder  shall be due on a day that is not a Business
         Day,  the date for payment  shall be  extended  to the next  succeeding
         Business  Day  and,  in the  case  of any  payment  accruing  interest,
         interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.

CURRENCY

15.2 All amounts payable under this Agreement in respect of any Letter of Credit
shall be payable in Sterling.

APPLICATION OF INSUFFICIENT PAYMENTS

15.3 If at any time  insufficient  funds are  received by and  available  to the
Agent to pay fully all Demand  Amounts,  interest,  fees and  expenses  then due
hereunder, such funds shall be applied:

(a)   FIRST, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid fees, costs, expenses,
      indemnity  payments  and other  amounts due to the Agent and the  Security
      Trustee under the Finance Documents;

(b)   SECONDLY,  in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid costs and expenses
      of the Lenders under the Finance Documents;

(c)   THIRDLY,  in or towards  payment pro rata of any  outstanding  fees (other
      than  Letter of Credit  Fees)  payable to the  Lenders  under the  Finance
      Documents;

(d)   FOURTHLY,  in or towards  payment pro rata of all accrued Letter of Credit

PRO RATA TREATMENT

15.4 Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

(a)   each reimbursement of LC Disbursements shall be made to the Lenders,  each
      payment of fees  under  Clause 9 (FEES)  shall be made for  account of the
      Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the Commitments under Clause
      8 (TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF THE  COMMITMENTS)  shall be applied to the
      respective  Commitments  of the  Lenders,  pro  rata  according  to  their
      respective Commitments; and

(b)   each payment of interest shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata
      in  accordance  with the amounts of  interest  then due and payable to the
      respective Lenders.

SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS

15.5 If any Lender shall,  by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or
otherwise,  obtain  payment  in respect of any LC  Exposures  resulting  in such
Lender receiving payment of a greater  proportion of the aggregate amount of its
LC Exposures and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion  received
by any other Lender,  then the Lender  receiving such greater  proportion  shall
purchase  (for cash at face value)  participations  in the LC Exposures of other
Lenders to the extent  necessary so that the benefit of all such payments  shall
be shared by the Lenders  rateably in accordance with the aggregate amount of LC
Exposures; provided that:

(a)   if any such  participations  are  purchased  and all or any portion of the
      payment  giving rise thereto is recovered,  such  participations  shall be
      rescinded and the purchase  price restored to the extent of such recovery,
      without interest; and

(b)   the  provisions  of this  Clause  shall not be  construed  to apply to any
      payment made by any Obligor pursuant to and in accordance with the express
      terms  of  this  Agreement  or  any  payment   obtained  by  a  Lender  as
      consideration  for the  assignment  of or sale  of a  participation  in LC
      Disbursements  to any assignee or  participant,  other than to the Account
      Party or any  Subsidiary or Affiliate  thereof (as to which the provisions
      of this paragraph shall apply).

Each  Obligor  consents  to the  foregoing  and  agrees,  to the  extent  it may
effectively  do  so  under   applicable   Law,  that  any  Lender   acquiring  a
participation  pursuant to the foregoing  arrangements  may exercise against the
Account  Party  rights  of  set-off  and  counterclaim   with  respect  to  such
participation  as fully as if such Lender were a direct  creditor of the Account
Party in the amount of such participation and the Obligors authorise the Lenders
to exchange Transfer  Certificates and any other documentation to give effect to
those purchases of participations.

PRESUMPTIONS OF PAYMENT

15.6  Unless the Agent  shall have  received  notice from any party prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Agent  hereunder that the payor will not
make such payment,  the Agent may assume that the payor has made such payment on
such date in  accordance  herewith  and may, in reliance  upon such  assumption,
distribute to the relevant payee the amount due. In such event, if the payor has
not in fact made such payment, then each of the

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


payees  severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed to that payee with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is  distributed  to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Agent,  at the Agent's  cost of funds from such  sources as the Agent may
reasonably select.

CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS BY THE AGENT

15.7 If any Lender  shall  fail to make any  payment  required  to be made by it
pursuant to Clause 15.5 (SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS), then the Agent may, in
its  discretion  (notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision  hereof),  apply any
amounts  thereafter  received by the Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy
such  Lender's  obligations  under  such  Clauses  until  all  such  unsatisfied
obligations are fully paid.

16.   GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY

      or  ineffective  as against the Account  Party for any reason  whatsoever,
      whether or not known to any Finance Party or any other person,  the amount
      of such loss being the amount  which the  person or persons  suffering  it
      would otherwise have been entitled to recover from the Account Party.

16.3 The obligations of each Guarantor  herein contained shall constitute and be
continuing obligations notwithstanding any settlement of account or other matter

Party by the  Finance  Documents  or by Law  shall be  discharged,  impaired  or
otherwise affected by:

(g)   any other act, event or omission  which,  but for this Clause 16.4,  might
      operate to discharge, impair or otherwise affect any of the obligations of
      any Guarantor  herein  contained or any of the rights,  powers or remedies
      conferred upon any of the Finance  Parties by the Finance  Documents or by
      Law.

SETTLEMENT CONDITIONAL

16.5 Any  settlement  or  discharge  between  any Obligor and any of the Finance
Parties shall be conditional upon no security or payment to any Finance Party by
the  Account  Party or any other  person on behalf of the  Account  Party  being
avoided or reduced by virtue of any Laws  relating  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,
liquidation or similar Laws of general  application and, if any such security or
payment is so avoided or  reduced,  each  Finance  Party  shall be  entitled  to
recover the value or amount of such  security or payment from the Account  Party
subsequently as if such settlement or discharge had not occurred.

EXERCISE OF RIGHTS

16.6 No Finance  Party  shall be obliged  before  exercising  any of the rights,

Finance Documents or by Law to:

      Finance Documents.

DEFERRAL OF GUARANTOR'S RIGHTS

16.7 Each  Guarantor  agrees that,  so long as any amounts are or may be owed by
the Account Party under the Finance  Documents or the Account Party is under any
actual or  contingent  obligations  under the  Finance  Documents,  it shall not
exercise any rights which it may at any time have by reason of performance by it
of its obligations under the Finance Documents:

(a)   to be indemnified by the Account Party; and/or

(b)   to claim any contribution  from any other Guarantor of the Account Party's
      obligations under the Finance Documents; and/or

(c)   to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation
      or  otherwise)  of any rights of the  Finance  Parties  under the  Finance
      Documents or of any other  security  taken  pursuant to, or in  connection
      with, this Agreement by all or any of the Finance Documents.

RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION

16.8 The  Guarantors  (other than the Account  Party) hereby  agree,  as between
themselves,  that if any such Guarantor shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor
(as defined  below) by reason of the payment by such Guarantor of any Guaranteed
Obligations,  each other  Guarantor  (other than the Account  Party)  shall,  on
demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but subject to the next sentence),  pay
to such Excess Funding  Guarantor an amount equal to such  Guarantor's  Pro Rata
Share (as defined below and determined,  for this purpose,  without reference to
the properties,  debts and liabilities of such Excess Funding  Guarantor) of the
Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations. The
payment  obligation of a Guarantor to any Excess  Funding  Guarantor  under this
Clause shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment
in full of the obligations of such Guarantor under the other  provisions of this
Clause 16 and such Excess  Funding  Guarantor  shall not  exercise  any right or
remedy with respect to such excess until payment and satisfaction in full of all
of such obligations.

For purposes of this Clause,  (i) EXCESS FUNDING  GUARANTOR means, in respect of
any Guaranteed Obligations, a Guarantor that has paid an amount in excess of its
Pro Rata Share of such  Guaranteed  Obligations,  (ii) EXCESS PAYMENT means,  in
respect of any  Guaranteed  Obligations,  the amount  paid by an Excess  Funding
Guarantor  in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such  Guaranteed  Obligations  and
(iii)  PRO RATA  SHARE  means,  for any  Guarantor,  the ratio  (expressed  as a
percentage) of (x) the amount by which the aggregate present fair saleable value
of all properties of such Guarantor  (excluding any shares of stock of any other
Guarantor) exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities of such Guarantor
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but
excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder and any obligations of any
other  Guarantor that have been  Guaranteed by such Guarantor) to (y) the amount
by which the  aggregate  fair  saleable  value of all  properties  of all of the
Guarantors  (other than the Account  Party)  exceeds the amount of all the debts
and liabilities (including contingent,  subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated
liabilities,  but excluding the obligations of the Guarantors  under this Clause
16) of all of the

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


Guarantors  (other than the Account  Party),  determined (A) with respect to any
Guarantor that is a party hereto on the date hereof, as of the date hereof,  and
(B) with respect to any other Guarantor, as of the date such Guarantor becomes a
Guarantor hereunder.

GENERAL LIMITATION ON GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS

16.9 In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate Law, or any state
or  Federal  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganisation  or other Law in any other
jurisdiction affecting the rights of creditors generally,  if the obligations of
any Guarantor  under Clause 16.1  (GUARANTEE  AND  INDEMNITY)  would  otherwise,
taking into account the  provisions  of Clause 16.8, be held or determined to be
void,  invalid  or  unenforceable,  or  subordinated  to the claims of any other
creditors,  on  account  of  the  amount  of its  liability  under  Clause  16.1
(GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY),  then,  notwithstanding any other provision hereof to
the contrary,  the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by
such  Guarantor,  any Lender,  the Agent or any other Person,  be  automatically
limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and  enforceable and not
subordinated  to the claims of other  creditors as  determined in such action or
proceeding.

bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganisation,  moratorium or similar Laws of general
applicability  affecting  the  enforcement  of  creditors'  rights  and  (b) the
application  of  general  principles  of  equity  (regardless  of  whether  such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon such Obligor or any of its
Significant  Subsidiaries  or  assets,  or give  rise to a right  thereunder  to
require  any payment to be made by any such  Person,  and (d) will not result in
the  creation or  imposition  of any Lien on any asset of such Obligor or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries.

FINANCIAL CONDITION; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE

17.5 (a) FINANCIAL CONDITION.  The Account Party has heretofore furnished to the
         Lenders  the  consolidated  balance  sheet and  statements  of  income,
         stockholders'  equity  and cash  flows  of the  Account  Party  and its
         consolidated  Subsidiaries  (A) as of and for  the  fiscal  year  ended
         December  31,  2003,   reported  on  by   PricewaterhouseCoopers   LLP,
         independent  public  accountants  (as  provided in the Account  Party's
         Report  on Form  10-K  filed  with the SEC for the  fiscal  year  ended
         December  31,  2003),  and (B) as of and for the fiscal  quarter  ended
         September 30, 2004, as provided in the Account  Party's  Report on Form
         10-Q filed  with the SEC for the fiscal  quarter  ended  September  30,
         2004.  Such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material
         respects,  the financial  position and results of  operations  and cash
         flows of the Account Party and its respective consolidated Subsidiaries
         as of such dates and for such  periods in  accordance  with GAAP or (in
         the  case of XL  Bermuda  or XL Re)  SAP,  subject  to  year-end  audit
         adjustments  and the absence of footnotes in the case of the statements
         referred to in Clause (B) of the first sentence of this paragraph.

     (b) NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE.  Since December 31, 2003, there has been no
         material adverse change in the assets, business, financial condition or
         operations of such Obligor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

PROPERTIES

17.6 (a) PROPERTY   GENERALLY.   Such  Obligor  and  each  of  its   Significant
         Subsidiaries  has good title to, or valid  leasehold  interests in, all
         its real and personal property  material to its business,  subject only
         to Liens  permitted by Clause 19.3 (LIENS) and except for minor defects

         business,  and the use  thereof  by such  Obligor  and its  Significant
         Subsidiaries  does not  infringe  upon the rights of any other  Person,
         except  for  any  such  infringements  that,  individually  or  in  the
         aggregate,  could not  reasonably  be  expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect.

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

17.7 (a) ACTIONS, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS.  Except as disclosed in Schedule 2 Part
         C or as  disclosed in the Account  Party's  filings with the SEC, or as
         routinely encountered in claims activity,  there are no actions,  suits
         or proceedings by or before any  arbitrator or  Governmental  Authority
         now pending  against or, to the knowledge of such  Obligor,  threatened
         against or affecting such Obligor or any of its  Subsidiaries (x) as to
         which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and
         that could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
         result in a Material  Adverse  Effect or (y) that  involve  the Finance
         Documents or the Transactions.

                                                                  Conformed Copy


(b)   ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2 Part D and except
      with respect to any other matters that,  individually or in the aggregate,
      could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material  Adverse  Effect,
      neither such Obligor nor any of its  Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply
      with any  Environmental  Law or to  obtain,  maintain  or comply  with any
      permit,  license or other  approval  required for its  business  under any
      Environmental  Law, (ii) has incurred any Environmental  Liability,  (iii)
      has  received  notice  of any  claim  with  respect  to any  Environmental
      Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND AGREEMENTS

17.8 Such Obligor and each of its  Subsidiaries  is in compliance with all Laws,
regulations  and orders of any  Governmental  Authority  applicable to it or its
property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or
its  property,  except  where  the  failure  to do  so,  individually  or in the
aggregate,  could not  reasonably  be expected  to result in a Material  Adverse
Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.

INVESTMENT AND HOLDING COMPANY STATUS

17.9 Such Obligor is not (a) an INVESTMENT  COMPANY as defined in, or subject to
regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a HOLDING COMPANY as
defined in, or subject to regulation  under,  the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935.

TAXES

17.10 Such Obligor and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be
filed all Tax returns  and  reports  required to have been filed and has paid or
caused to be paid all Taxes  required to have been paid by it,  except (a) Taxes
that are being contested in good faith by appropriate  proceedings and for which
such  Person has set aside on its books  adequate  reserves or (b) to the extent
that the  failure  to do so could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

ERISA

17.11 No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably  expected to occur that, when
taken  together  with all  other  such  ERISA  Events  for  which  liability  is
reasonably  expected  to occur,  could  reasonably  be  expected  to result in a
Material  Adverse  Effect.   The  present  value  of  all  accumulated   benefit
obligations  under each Plan  (based on the  assumptions  used for  purposes  of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of
the most recent financial  statements  reflecting such amounts,  exceed the fair
market  value of the assets of such Plan by an amount that could  reasonably  be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Except as could not  reasonably  be  expected  to result in a  Material  Adverse
Effect, (i) all contributions required to be made by any Obligor or any of their
Subsidiaries with respect to a Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been timely made, (ii)
each Non-U.S.  Benefit Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and
with the  requirements of any and all applicable  Laws and has been  maintained,
where required, in good standing with the applicable  Governmental Authority and
(iii)  neither  any  Obligor  nor any of their  Subsidiaries  has  incurred  any
obligation in connection  with the  termination or withdrawal  from any Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan.

DISCLOSURE

17.12 The  reports,  financial  statements,  certificates  or other  information
furnished by such Obligor to the Lenders in connection  with the  negotiation of
this Agreement or any other Finance Document or delivered  hereunder (taken as a
whole) do not contain  any  material  misstatement  of fact or omit to state any
material  fact  necessary to make the  statements  therein,  in the light of the
circumstances  under which they were made, not  misleading;  provided that, with
respect to projected  financial  information,  such Obligor represents only that
such information was prepared in good faith based upon  assumptions  believed to
be reasonable at the time.

USE OF CREDIT

17.13 Neither such Obligor nor any of its  Subsidiaries is engaged  principally,
or as one of its important  activities,  in the business of extending credit for
the purpose,  whether immediate,  incidental or ultimate,  of buying or carrying

carrying any Margin Stock.

such  Person  organised  as a  corporation  is  validly  issued,  fully paid and
nonassessable  and (z) except as disclosed in filings of the Account  Party with
the SEC prior to the date hereof,  there are no  outstanding  Equity Rights with
respect to any Obligor.

WITHHOLDING TAXES

17.15 Based upon information with respect to each Lender provided by each Lender

      any prospective new Lender) to comply with "know your customer" or similar
      identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information

      documentation  and other evidence as is reasonably  requested by the Agent
      (for  itself or on behalf of any  Lender) or any Lender (for itself or, in

      prospective  new  Lender) in order for the Agent,  such  Lender or, in the
      case of the event described in paragraph (iii) above,  any prospective new
      Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has  complied  with all  necessary
      "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and

18.4 Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its Significant  Subsidiaries to,
maintain its corporate  existence and its material rights and franchises in full
force and effect in its jurisdiction of  incorporation  except where the failure
to maintain such corporate  existence and material  rights and franchises  would
not reasonably be expected to have, either  individually or in the aggregate,  a
Material  Adverse  Effect;  provided that the  foregoing  shall not prohibit any
merger  or   consolidation   permitted  under  Clause  19.1  (MERGERS)  or  19.2
(DISPOSITIONS).  Each  Obligor  will,  and will  cause  each of its  Significant
Subsidiaries to, qualify and remain  qualified as a foreign  corporation in each
jurisdiction in which failure to receive or retain such qualification would have
a Material Adverse Effect.

INSURANCE

18.5 Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its Significant  Subsidiaries to,

situated.

MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES

18.6 Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its Significant  Subsidiaries to,
maintain or cause to be maintained  in good repair,  working order and condition
the properties now or hereafter owned, leased or otherwise possessed by and used

proper repairs,  renewals,  replacements  and  improvements  thereto so that the
business  carried on in connection  therewith  may be properly  conducted at all
times except if the failure to do so would not have a Material  Adverse  Effect,
provided,  however,  that the foregoing  shall not impose on such Obligor or any
Subsidiary of such Obligor any  obligation in respect of any property  leased by
such Obligor or such Subsidiary in addition to such Obligor's  obligations under
the applicable  document creating such Obligor's or such  Subsidiary's  lease or
tenancy.

PAYMENT OF TAXES AND OTHER  POTENTIAL  CHARGES AND  PRIORITY  CLAIMS  PAYMENT OF
OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

18.7 Each  Obligor  will,  and will  cause each of its  Subsidiaries  to, pay or
discharge:

<PAGE>

(a)   on or prior to the date on which  penalties  attach  thereto,  all  taxes,
      assessments  and other  governmental  charges or levies imposed upon it or
      any of its properties or income;

(b)   on or prior to the date  when  due,  all  lawful  claims  of  materialmen,
      mechanics, carriers, warehousemen, landlords and other like Persons which,
      if unpaid,  might result in the creation of a Lien upon any such property;
      and

(c)   on or prior to the date  when due,  all  other  lawful  claims  which,  if
      unpaid,  might  result in the  creation  of a Lien upon any such  property
      (other  than Liens not  forbidden  by Clause 19.3  (LIENS))  or which,  if
      unpaid,  might give rise to a claim  entitled  to  priority  over  general
      creditors of such Obligor or such  Subsidiary in any proceeding  under the
      Bermuda  Companies  Law  or  Bermuda  Insurance  Law,  or  any  insolvency
      proceeding,  liquidation,  receivership,  rehabilitation,  dissolution  or
      winding-up involving such Obligor or such Subsidiary;

provided that, unless and until  foreclosure,  distraint,  levy, sale or similar
proceedings shall have been commenced,  such Obligor or such Subsidiary need not
pay or discharge any such tax, assessment,  charge, levy or claim so long as (i)
the validity  thereof is contested in good faith and by appropriate  proceedings
diligently  conducted or (ii) such reserves or other  appropriate  provisions as
may be  required  by GAAP or SAP,  as the  case may be,  shall  have  been  made
therefor  and so long as such  failure  to pay or  discharge  would  not  have a
Material Adverse Effect.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

18.8 Such Obligor will, and will cause each of its consolidated Subsidiaries to,
make  and  keep  books,  records  and  accounts  which,  in  reasonable  detail,
accurately and fairly reflect its  transactions  and  dispositions of its assets
and  maintain a system of internal  accounting  controls  sufficient  to provide
reasonable  assurances  that  transactions  are  recorded as necessary to permit
preparation  of  financial  statements  required  under  Clause 18.1  (FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  AND  OTHER   INFORMATION)  in  conformity  with  GAAP  and  SAP,  as
applicable, and to maintain accountability for assets.

COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS

18.9 Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its  Subsidiaries to, comply with
all applicable Laws (including but not limited to the Bermuda  Companies Law and
Bermuda  Insurance  Laws) in all  respects;  provided  that such  Obligor or any
Subsidiary  of such Obligor will not be deemed to be in violation of this Clause
as a result  of any  failure  to comply  with any such Law  which  would not (i)
result  in  fines,  penalties,  injunctive  relief  or other  civil or  criminal
liabilities  which,  in the aggregate,  would have a Material  Adverse Effect or
(ii)  otherwise  impair the ability of such  Obligor to perform its  obligations
under this Agreement.

USE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PROCEEDS

18.10 No Letter of Credit will be used, whether directly or indirectly,  for any
purpose  that  entails  a  violation  of any of the  Regulations  of the  Board,
including  Regulations  U and X. Each  Applicant  will use the Letters of Credit
issued for its  account  hereunder  in the  ordinary  course of business of such
Applicant and its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that
the  Account  Party may apply for a Letter of Credit  hereunder  to support  the
obligations  of any  Affiliate of an  Applicant,  it being  understood  that the
Account  Party shall  nonetheless  remain the Obligor and as such be liable with
respect to such Letter of Credit.

CONTINUATION OF AND CHANGE IN BUSINESSES

18.11 Each Obligor and its Significant  Subsidiaries  will continue to engage in
substantially  the same  business or  businesses  it engaged in (or  proposes to
engage in) on the date of this  Agreement and  businesses  related or incidental
thereto.

VISITATION

18.12 Each  Obligor  will  permit  such  Persons  as any  Lender may  reasonably
designate to visit and inspect any of the properties of such Obligor, to discuss
its affairs with its financial  management,  and provide such other  information
relating to the business and  financial  condition of such Obligor at such times
as such Lender may  reasonably  request.  Each  Obligor  hereby  authorises  its
financial management to discuss with any Lender the affairs of such Obligor.

      a Subsidiary, if such Obligor shall be the surviving corporation;

(b)   the  Account  Party may merge with or into or  consolidate  with any other
      Person  in a  transaction  that  does not  result  in a  reclassification,

      stock of the Account Party (other than the cancellation of any outstanding
      shares of capital  stock of the Account Party held by the Person with whom
      it merges or consolidates); and

(c)   any  Obligor  may enter into a merger or  consolidation  which is effected
      solely to change the  jurisdiction  of  incorporation  of such Obligor and

      shares of capital  stock of such  Obligor  solely  into  shares of capital
      stock of the surviving entity.

(e)   be or be deemed to be a fiduciary for any other party hereto; or

(f)   be  obliged  to carry  out any "know  your  customer"  or other  checks in
      relation to any person on behalf of any Lender and each Lender confirms to
      the Agent and the  Arranger  that it is  solely  responsible  for any such
      checks  it is  required  to  carry  out and  that  it may not  rely on any
      statement in relation to such checks made by the Agent or the Arranger.

INDEMNIFICATION

21.5 Each Lender shall,  pro rata according to its respective  Commitment,  from
time to time on demand by the Agent,  indemnify  the Agent  against  any and all
costs, claims, losses,  expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities together
with any value  added tax  thereon  (or  equivalent)  which the Agent may incur,
otherwise than by reason of its own gross  negligence or wilful  misconduct,  in
acting in its capacity as agent hereunder.

EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES

21.6 Except in the case of gross negligence or wilful default, neither the Agent
nor the Arrangers accept any responsibility:

(a)   for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information supplied
      by the Agent or the  Arrangers,  by an Obligor  or by any other  person in
      connection with the Finance Documents or any other agreement,  arrangement
      or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to
      or in connection with the Finance Documents;

(b)   for the legality, validity,  effectiveness,  adequacy or enforceability of
      the Finance  Documents  or any other  agreement,  arrangement  or document
      entered  into,  made or executed  in  anticipation  of,  pursuant to or in
      connection with the Finance Documents; or

(c)   for the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any judgement, discretion
      or  power  given  to any of  them by or in  connection  with  the  Finance
      Documents or any other  agreement,  arrangement or document  entered into,
      made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with the
      Finance Documents.

Accordingly,  neither the Agent nor the  Arrangers  shall be under any liability
(whether in negligence  or  otherwise)  in respect of such matters,  save in the
case of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

NO ACTIONS

21.7 Each of the Lenders agree that it will not assert or seek to assert against
any  director,  officer or employee of the Agent or the  Arrangers  any claim it
might have  against any of them in respect of the matters  referred to in Clause
21.6 (EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES).

BUSINESS WITH THE GROUP

21.8 The Agent and the Arrangers  may accept  deposits  from,  lend money to and
generally  engage  in any  kind of  banking  or other  business  with any of the
Obligors or their Subsidiaries.

RESIGNATION

21.9 The  Agent  may  resign  its  appointment  hereunder  at any  time  without
assigning any reason  therefor by giving not less than thirty days' prior notice
to that  effect  to each of the  other  parties  hereto,  PROVIDED  THAT no such
resignation  shall be effective  until a successor for the Agent is appointed in
accordance with the succeeding provisions of this Clause 21.

SUCCESSOR AGENT

21.10 If the Agent  gives  notice of its  resignation  pursuant  to Clause  21.9
(RESIGNATION)  then any  reputable  and  experienced  Lender or other  financial
institution may be appointed as a successor to the Agent by the Majority Lenders
(with the  approval of the Account  Party,  not to be  unreasonably  withheld or
delayed,)  during the period of such notice (with the co-operation of the Agent)
but,  if no such  successor  is so  appointed,  the  Agent  may  appoint  such a
successor itself.

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

21.11 If a successor to the Agent is appointed  under the  provisions  of Clause
21.10  (SUCCESSOR  AGENT),  then (a) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from
any further obligation hereunder but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the
provisions of this Clause 21 and (b) its successor and each of the other parties
hereto shall have the same rights and  obligations  amongst  themselves  as they
would have had if such successor had been a party hereto.

OWN RESPONSIBILITY

21.12 It is understood and agreed by each Lender that at all times it has itself
been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent
appraisal of and  investigation  into all risks  arising  under or in connection
with this Agreement including, but not limited to:

(a)   the financial condition, creditworthiness,  condition, affairs, status and
      nature of each member of the Group;

(b)   the legality, validity, effectiveness,  adequacy and enforceability of the
      Finance Documents and any other agreement, arrangement or document entered
      into,  made or executed in  anticipation  of, pursuant to or in connection
      with the Finance Documents;

(c)   whether  such  Lender  has  recourse,  and the  nature  and extent of that
      recourse,  against  an  Obligor  or any other  person or any of its assets
      under or in connection with the Finance Documents, the Transactions or any
      other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
      anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with the Finance  Documents;
      and

(d)   the adequacy,  accuracy and/or completeness of any information provided by
      the  Agent  or the  Arrangers,  an  Obligor  or by  any  other  person  in
      connection  with the  Finance  Documents,  the  Transactions  or any other
      agreement, arrangement or

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


      document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or
      in connection with the Finance Documents.

Accordingly, each Lender acknowledges to the Agent and the Arrangers that it has
not relied on and will not hereafter  rely on the Agent and the Arrangers or any
of them in respect of any of these matters.

AGENCY DIVISION SEPARATE

21.13 In acting as agent hereunder for the Lenders,  the Agent shall be regarded
as acting  through  its  agency  division  which  shall be treated as a separate
entity from any other of its divisions or departments and,  notwithstanding  the
foregoing  provisions of this Clause 21, any information  received by some other
division or department of the Agent may be treated as confidential and shall not
be regarded as having been given to the Agent's agency division.

DECLARATION OF AGENT AS SECURITY TRUSTEE

21.14 The Agent hereby declares that it shall hold:

(a)   all rights, titles and interests that may hereafter be mortgaged, charged,
      assigned or otherwise secured in favour of the Agent by or pursuant to the
      Finance Documents;

(b)   the benefit of all representations, covenants, guarantees, indemnities and
      other contractual  provisions given in favour of the Agent (other than any
      such  benefits  given  to the  Agent  solely  for its own  benefit)  by or
      pursuant to the Finance Documents (other than this Agreement); and

(c)   all proceeds of the security referred to in paragraph (a) above and of the
      enforcement of the benefits referred to in paragraph (b) above,

on trust for itself and the other Finance Parties from time to time.

Such declaration  shall remain valid  notwithstanding  that the Agent may on the
date hereof or at any other time be the sole Finance Party; for the avoidance of
doubt, however, such declaration shall, in such case, be deemed repeated on each
date on which the Agent ceases to be the sole Finance Party.

Each of the parties  hereto  agrees that the  obligations,  rights and  benefits
vested or to be  vested in the Agent as  trustee  as  aforesaid  by the  Finance
Documents or any document entered into pursuant thereto shall (as well before as
after  enforcement) be performed and (as the case may be) exercised by the Agent
in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 21.

POWERS AND DISCRETIONS

21.15 The  Agent  shall  have all the  powers  and  discretions  conferred  upon
trustees by the Trustee Act 1925 (to the extent not  inconsistent  herewith) and
by way of supplement it is expressly declared as follows:

(a)   the Agent  shall be at liberty to place any of the Finance  Documents  and
      any other instruments, documents or deeds delivered to it pursuant thereto
      or in  connection  therewith  for the time being in its  possession in any
      safe deposit, safe or receptacle selected by the Agent or with any Lender,
      any  company  whose  business  includes  undertaking  the safe  custody of
      documents or any firm of lawyers of good repute;

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


(b)   the Agent may,  whenever it thinks  fit,  delegate by power of attorney or
      otherwise to any person or persons or  fluctuating  body of persons all or
      any of the rights, trusts,  powers,  authorities and discretions vested in
      it by any of the Finance  Documents and such  delegation  may be made upon
      such  terms  and  subject  to such  conditions  (including  the  power  to
      sub-delegate)  and subject to such  regulations as the Agent may think fit
      and  the  Agent  shall  not  be  bound  to  supervise,  or be in  any  way
      responsible  for any loss incurred by reason of any  misconduct or default
      on the part of, any such delegate (or sub-delegate);

(c)   notwithstanding anything else herein contained, the Agent may refrain from
      doing  anything which would or might in its opinion be contrary to any Law
      of any  jurisdiction  or any  directive or regulation of any agency of any
      state or which would or might otherwise render it liable to any person and
      may do anything  which is, in its  opinion,  necessary  to comply with any
      such Law, directive or regulation;

(d)   save in the case of gross negligence or wilful  misconduct,  the Agent and
      every  attorney,  agent,  delegate,  sub-delegate  and  any  other  person
      appointed by any of them under any of the Finance  Documents may indemnify
      itself  or  himself  out of the  security  held by the Agent  against  all
      liabilities,  costs, fees, charges, losses and expenses incurred by any of
      them in  relation to or arising out of the taking or holding of any of the
      security  constituted  by, or any of the benefits  provided by, any of the
      Finance  Documents,  in the exercise or purported  exercise of the rights,
      trusts,  powers and discretions vested in any of them or in respect of any
      other  matter or thing done or omitted to be done in any way  relating  to
      any of the Finance Documents or pursuant to any Law or regulation; and

(e)   without prejudice to the provisions of any of the Finance  Documents,  the
      Agent  shall not be under any  obligation  to insure  any  property  or to
      require any other person to maintain any such  insurance  and shall not be
      responsible  for any loss which may be  suffered by any person as a result
      of the lack of or inadequacy or insufficiency of any such insurance.

LIABILITY

21.16 The Agent shall not be liable for any failure:

(a)   to  require  the  deposit  with  it of any  deed or  document  certifying,
      representing or constituting  the title of the Account Party to any of the
      property  mortgaged,  charged,  assigned  or  otherwise  encumbered  by or
      pursuant to any of the Finance Documents;

(b)   to obtain any  licence,  consent  or other  authority  for the  execution,

(c)   to register  or notify any deed or document  mentioned  at  paragraph  (a)
      above in accordance  with the  provisions of any of the documents of title

(d)   to effect or  procure  registration  of or  otherwise  protect  any of the
      security  created by any of the Finance  Documents by registering the same
      under any  applicable  registration  Laws in any territory or otherwise by
      registering any notice,  caution or other entry  prescribed by or pursuant
      to the provisions of relevant Laws;

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


(e)   to take or to require  the  Account  Party to take any steps to render the
      security  created or  purported to be created by or pursuant to any of the
      Finance  Documents  effective or to secure the  creation of any  ancillary
      charge under the Laws of any jurisdiction; or

(f)   to require  any  further  assurances  in  relation  to any of the  Finance
      Documents.

TITLE TO SECURITY ETC.

21.17 The Agent may accept without enquiry,  requisition or objection such right
and  title  as the  Account  Party  may  have  to  the  property  belonging  (or
purportedly  belonging) to it (or any part thereof)  which is the subject matter
of any of  the  Finance  Documents  and  shall  not be  bound  or  concerned  to
investigate  or make any enquiry into the right or title of the Account Party to
such property (or any part thereof) or, without  prejudice to the foregoing,  to
require the Account  Party to remedy any defect in the Account  Party's right or
title as aforesaid.

NEW SECURITY TRUSTEE

21.18 The Agent  may at any time  appoint  any  person  (whether  or not a trust
corporation) to act either as a separate trustee or as a co-trustee jointly with
the Agent:

(a)   if the Agent  considers  such  appointment  to be in the  interests of the
      Lenders; or

(b)   for the purposes of conforming to any legal requirements,  restrictions or
      conditions  which the Agent deems relevant for the purposes of the Finance
      Documents  and the Agent shall give prior notice to the Account  Party and
      the Lenders of any such appointment.

Any  person  so  appointed  shall  (subject  to the  provisions  of the  Finance
Documents)  have such powers,  authorities  and  discretions and such duties and
obligations as shall be conferred or imposed or such person by the instrument of
appointment and shall have the same benefits under this Clause 21 as the Agent.

The Agent shall have power in like manner to remove any person so appointed.

Such  reasonable  remuneration  as the Agent may pay to any person so appointed,
and any costs,  charges and expenses  incurred by such person in performing  its
functions pursuant to such appointment, shall for the purposes hereof be treated
as  costs,  charges  and  expenses  incurred  by the  Agent  under  the  Finance
Documents.

PERPETUITY PERIOD

21.19 The perpetuity period under the rule against perpetuities if applicable to
the trusts  constituted in this Clause 21 and the other Finance  Documents shall

Party under any of the  Finance  Documents  have been fully and  unconditionally
discharged, such trusts shall be wound up.

Agent in connection therewith;  and (b) inform the Agent promptly if at any time

23.   WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS

NO DEEMED WAIVERS

23.1 No failure or delay by any Finance Party in  exercising  any right or power
hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power,  or any  abandonment or  discontinuance  of
steps to enforce such a right or power,  preclude any other or further  exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  No waiver of any provision
of this Agreement or consent to any departure by an Obligor  therefrom  shall in
any event be  effective  unless  the same  shall be  permitted  by  Clause  23.3
(AMENDMENTS),  and then such waiver or consent  shall be  effective  only in the
specific  instance  and for the purpose for which  given.  Without  limiting the
generality  of the  foregoing,  the  issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed  as a waiver of any  Default,  regardless  of whether the Agent or any
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

23.2 The rights and remedies of the Finance Parties hereunder are cumulative and
are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.

modified  except  pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by the Obligors  and the Majority  Lenders or by the Obligors and the Agent with
the consent of the Majority Lenders; PROVIDED that no such agreement shall:

(a)   increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written  consent of such
      Lender,

(b)   reduce the amount of any reimbursement  obligation of the Account Party in
      respect of any LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon,  or
      reduce any fees  payable  hereunder,  without the written  consent of each
      Lender affected thereby,

(c)   postpone the scheduled date for  reimbursement of any LC Disbursement,  or
      any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder,  or reduce the amount
      of, waive or excuse any such payment,  or postpone the  scheduled  date of
      expiration  of any  Commitment  or any  Letter  of Credit  (other  than an
      extension  thereof  pursuant to Clause 4), without the written  consent of
      each Lender affected thereby,

(d)   change  Clause 15.4 (PRO RATA  TREATMENT)  or 15.5 (SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY
      LENDERS) without the consent of each Lender affected thereby,

(e)   release  any of the  Guarantors  from any of their  guarantee  obligations
      under Clause 16 (GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY)  without the written  consent of

      definition  of the term  MAJORITY  LENDERS or any other  provision  hereof
      specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or
      modify any rights hereunder or

      make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written
      consent of each Lender;

and PROVIDED  FURTHER that no such  agreement  shall amend,  modify or otherwise
affect the rights or duties of the Agent  hereunder  without  the prior  written
consent of the Agent.

24.   COSTS AND EXPENSES

24.1 The Account Party shall pay:

(a)   all reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses and charges  incurred by the Agent
      and/or the  Arrangers  (together  with VAT or any  similar tax thereon and
      including the reasonable  fees,  charges and  disbursements of counsel for
      the Agent) in connection  with the  syndication  of the credit  facilities
      provided  for  herein,   the  negotiation,   preparation,   execution  and
      administration  of the  Finance  Documents  (subject  to the  terms of the
      Commitment  Letter)  or any  amendments,  modifications  or waivers of the
      provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions  contemplated hereby or
      thereby shall be consummated);

      Trustee or any Lender,  (together  with VAT or any similar tax thereon and

      rights in  connection  with the Finance  Documents,  including  its rights
      under  this  Clause,  or in  connection  with  Letters  of  Credit  issued
      hereunder,  including in  connection  with any workout,  restructuring  or
      negotiations in respect thereof.

24.2 The  Account  Party shall pay all  transfer,  stamp,  documentary  or other
similar  taxes,  assessments or charges  levied by any  governmental  or revenue
authority in respect of this Agreement or any other document referred to herein.

25.   INDEMNITIES

CURRENCY INDEMNITY

25.1 (a) If:

      (i)   any amount payable by the Account Party under or in connection  with
            this  Agreement is received by any Finance  Party in a currency (the
            PAYMENT  CURRENCY)  other than that  agreed in this  Agreement  (the
            AGREED  CURRENCY)  whether as a result of any  judgement or order or
            the enforcement  thereof, the liquidation of the payer or otherwise;
            and

      (ii)  the amount  produced by converting the Payment  Currency so received
            into the Agreed  Currency  is less than the  relevant  amount of the
            Agreed Currency.

      then the Account Party shall, as an independent obligation, indemnify such
      Finance Party for the deficiency and any loss sustained as a result.  Such
      conversion shall be made at such prevailing rate of exchange, on such date
      and in such market as is

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


      determined  by such  Finance  Party  (acting  reasonably)  as  being  most
      appropriate  for the  conversion.  The Account Party shall in addition pay
      the costs of the conversion.

(b)   The Account Party waives any right it may have in any  jurisdiction to pay
      any amount under this  Agreement in a currency other than that in which it
      is expressed to be payable in this Agreement.

OTHER INDEMNITIES

25.2 The Obligors  shall  indemnify the Agent and each Lender,  and each Related
Party  of any of the  foregoing  Persons  (each  such  Person  being  called  an
INDEMNITEE)  against,  and to hold each  Indemnitee  harmless  from, any and all
losses, claims, damages,  liabilities and related expenses,  including the fees,
charges and  disbursements  of any counsel  for any  Indemnitee,  incurred by or
asserted  against any  Indemnitee  arising out of, in  connection  with, or as a
result of:

(a)   the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
      contemplated  hereby,  the  performance  by the  parties  hereto  of their
      respective  obligations  hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions
      or any other transactions contemplated hereby;

(b)   any Letter of Credit or the use of any thereof  (including  any refusal by
      any Lender to honour a demand for payment  under a Letter of Credit if the
      documents  presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply
      with the terms of such Letter of Credit);

(c)   any actual or prospective claim,  litigation,  investigation or proceeding
      relating to any of the foregoing,  whether based on contract,  tort or any
      other theory and  regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
      provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available
      to the extent that such losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities or related
      expenses  result  from or arise  out of the  gross  negligence  or  wilful
      misconduct of such Indemnitee.

REIMBURSEMENT BY LENDERS

25.3 To the extent that the Obligors fail to pay any amount  required to be paid
by them to the Agent under  Clauses 25 (COSTS AND  EXPENSES)  or 25.1  (CURRENCY
INDEMNITY) and 25.2 (OTHER INDEMNITIES),  each Lender severally agrees to pay to
the Agent such Lender's  Applicable  Percentage  (determined as of the time that
the  applicable  unreimbursed  expense or  indemnity  payment is sought) of such

TRANSFERS BY LENDERS.

26.3 (a) Any  Lender  (the  TRANSFEROR)  may at any  time  transfer  to  another
         Approved Credit  Institution  (the  TRANSFEREE) all or a portion of its
         rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
         of its  Commitment)  and  under  any  Letter of Credit to which it is a
         party; PROVIDED THAT:

      (i)   except in the case of an transfer to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate,
            each of the  Account  Party and the  Agent  must  give  their  prior
            written  consent  to such  assignment  (which  consent  shall not be
            unreasonably withheld or delayed);

      (ii)  except in the case of an transfer to a Lender or a Lender  Affiliate
            or a transfer  of the entire  remaining  amount of the  Transferor's
            Commitment,  the amount of the Commitment of the Transferor  subject
            to each such  transfer  (determined  as of the date of the  Transfer
            Certificate) shall not be less than (pound)3,000,000  unless each of
            the Account Party and the Agent otherwise consent;

      (iii) a transfer of obligations shall only be effective if the Transferee:

            (A)   if it shall not be a Lender,  has delivered  relevant contact,
                  notice and  account  details to the Agent  (with a copy to the
                  Account  Party)  as well as any  information  required  by the
                  Agent to perform "know your customer" or other checks relating
                  to any person  that it is required to carry out in relation to
                  the  Transferee,  the  completion  of which  the  Agent  shall
                  promptly notify to the Transferor and the Transferee; and

            (B)   has  confirmed to the Agent and the Account Party prior to the
                  transfer  taking  effect that it undertakes to be bound by the
                  terms  of this  Agreement  as  Lender  in form  and  substance
                  reasonably  satisfactory  to the Agent and the Account  Party;
                  and on any such transfer  being made the  Transferor  shall be
                  relieved of its obligations to the extent they are transferred
                  to the Transferee.

      PROVIDED FURTHER that any consent of the Account Party otherwise  required
      under this  paragraph  shall not be required if an Event of Default  under
      Clause  20(a),  (e) or (f) has occurred and is  continuing.  Upon transfer
      pursuant  to  Clause  26.4,  from and  after  the last to occur of (i) the
      effective  date  specified  in each  Transfer  Certificate;  and  (ii) the
      cancellation of a Letter of Credit and the issue of a new Letter of Credit
      with the  Transferee  identified as an Issuing  Lender (the ISSUING LENDER
      TRANSFER),  the Transferee  thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
      extent of the lesser of the interest assigned by such Transfer Certificate
      and the  Transferee's  participation  as an Issuing  Lender of a re-issued
      Letter  of  Credit  (the  TRANSFERRED  INTEREST),   have  the  rights  and
      obligations  of  a  Lender  under  this  Agreement,   and  the  Transferor
      thereunder shall, to the extent of the Transferred  Interest,  be released
      from its  obligations  under this Agreement  (and, in the case of Transfer
      Certificate  covering all of the Transferor's rights and obligations under
      this  Agreement,  such Lender  shall cease to be a party  hereto but shall
      continue to be entitled to the benefits of Clauses 12  (INCREASED  COSTS),
      10 (TAXES) 24 (COSTS AND EXPENSES) and 25  (INDEMNITIES)).  Any assignment
      or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that
      does not comply with this paragraph  shall be treated for purposes of this
      Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a  participation  in such rights and
      obligations in accordance with Clause 26.7 (PARTICIPATIONS).

                                                                  Conformed Copy


      Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained herein, any Lender (a
      GRANTING  LENDER) may grant to a special  purpose vehicle (an SPV) of such
      Granting  Lender,  identified  as such in writing from time to time by the
      Granting Lender to the Agent and the Account Party,  the option to provide
      to the  Account  Party  all or any part of any LC  Disbursement  that such
      Granting  Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Account Party
      pursuant to Clause 2.1,  PROVIDED that (i) nothing herein shall constitute
      a commitment by any SPV to make any LC Disbursement, (ii) if an SPV elects
      not to exercise such option or otherwise  fails to provide all or any part
      of such LC  Disbursement,  the Granting  Lender shall be obligated to make
      such LC  Disbursement  pursuant to the terms  hereof and (iii) the Account
      Party may bring any proceeding  against either or both the Granting Lender
      or the SPV in order to enforce any rights of the Account Party  hereunder;
      and   (iv)  the  SPV   shall   agree  to  the   terms   of   Clause   30.2
      (CONFIDENTIALITY).  The making of an LC  Disbursement  by an SPV hereunder
      shall utilise the  Commitment  of the Granting  Lender to the same extent,
      and as if, such LC  Disbursement  were made by the Granting  Lender.  Each
      party  hereto  hereby  agrees  that no SPV shall be liable for any payment
      under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable,  for so
      long as,  and to the  extent,  the  related  Granting  Lender  makes  such
      payment. In furtherance of the foregoing,  each party hereto hereby agrees
      (which  agreement shall survive the  termination of this Agreement)  that,
      prior to the date that is one year and one day after the  payment  in full
      of all outstanding  commercial  paper or other senior  indebtedness of any
      SPV,  it  will  not  institute  against,  or  join  any  other  person  in
      instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement,
      insolvency or  liquidation  proceedings or similar  proceedings  under the
      Laws of the United  States or any State  thereof  arising out of any claim
      against  such SPV  under  this  Agreement.  In  addition,  notwithstanding
      anything to the contrary contained in this Clause, any SPV may with notice
      to, but without  the prior  written  consent of, the Account  Party or the
      Agent and without  paying any  processing  fee  therefor,  assign all or a
      portion of its interests in any Letter of Credit to its Granting Lender or
      to any financial  institutions  (consented to by the Account Party and the
      Agent) providing  liquidity and/or credit support (if any) with respect to
      commercial  paper  issued by such SPV to issue such  Letters of Credit and
      such SPV may disclose, on a confidential basis,  confidential  information
      with  respect  to any  Account  Party and its  Subsidiaries  to any rating
      agency,  commercial  paper  dealer or provider of a surety,  guarantee  or
      credit  liquidity  enhancement  to such  SPV.  This  paragraph  may not be
      amended   without  the  consent  of  any  SPV  at  the  time   holding  LC
      Disbursements under this Agreement.

(b)   On each  occasion a  Transferor  assigns,  transfers or novates any of its
      rights and/or obligations under this Agreement,  the Transferee (unless it
      is  already  a  Lender  or a  Lender  Affiliate  immediately  prior to the
      transfer) shall ensure that the Agent has notice of the same and shall, on
      the date the assignment, transfer and/or novation takes effect, pay to the
      Agent for its own account a fee of (pound)1,000.

(c)   Neither a  Transferor  nor any other  Finance  Party is  responsible  to a
      Transferee for:

      (i)   the execution, genuineness,  validity, enforceability or sufficiency
            of any Finance Documents or any other document;

      (ii)  the collectability of amounts payable under any Finance Documents or
            the financial  condition of or the  performance  of its  obligations
            under the Finance Documents by any Obligor; or

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


      (iii) the accuracy of any  statements or information  (whether  written or
            oral) made in or in connection  with or supplied in connection  with
            any Finance Documents.

(d)   Each  Transferee  confirms to the Transferor and the other Finance Parties
      that it:

      (i)   has made its own  independent  investigation  and  assessment of the
            financial  condition  and  affairs of each  Obligor  and its related
            entities in connection with its  participation in this Agreement and
            has not relied exclusively on any information  provided to it by the
            Transferor or any other Finance Party in connection with any Finance
            Documents; and

      (ii)  will  continue  to  make  its  own  independent   appraisal  of  the
            creditworthiness  of each  Obligor and its related  entities  for so
            long as  there  are  any  Commitments  or LC  Exposures  under  this
            Agreement.

(e)   Nothing in any Finance Document obliges a Transferor to:

      (i)   accept a re-transfer  from an Transferee of any of the rights and/or
            obligations assigned, transferred or novated under this Clause; or

      (ii)  support  any  losses  incurred  by the  Transferee  by reason of the
            non-performance  by any Obligor of its obligations under any Finance
            Document or otherwise.

26.4 TRANSFER PROCEDURE:

(a)   A novation is effected if:

      (i)   the  Transferor  and  the  Transferee  deliver  to the  Agent a duly
            completed  Transfer  Certificate  executed by the Transferor and the
            Transferee; and

      (ii)  the Agent executes it

      PROVIDED  THAT the Agent  shall  only be  obliged  to  execute a  Transfer
      Certificate  delivered to it by the Transferor and the Transferee  once it
      is satisfied it has complied  with all necessary  "know your  customer" or
      similar other checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation
      to the transfer to such Transferee.

(b)   Each Party  (other than the  Transferor  and the  Transferee)  irrevocably
      authorises the Agent to execute any duly completed Transfer Certificate on
      its behalf.

(c)   To the extent that they are expressed to be the subject of the novation in
      the Transfer Certificate:

      (i)   the Transferor and the other Parties (the EXISTING  PARTIES) will be
            released  from their  obligations  to each other  under the  Finance
            Documents (the DISCHARGED OBLIGATIONS);

      (ii)  the  Transferee  and the existing  Parties  will assume  obligations
            towards each other under the Finance Documents which differ from the
            discharged  obligations  only insofar as they are owed to or assumed
            by the Transferee instead of the Transferor;

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


      (iii) the rights of the Transferor  against the existing Parties under the
            Finance  Documents  and vice versa (the  DISCHARGED  RIGHTS) will be
            cancelled; and

      (iv)  the Transferee and the existing  Parties will acquire rights against
            each  other  under  the  Finance  Documents  which  differ  from the
            discharged rights only insofar as they are exercisable by or against
            the Transferee instead of the Transferor,

      all on the date specified in the proviso to Clause 26.3(a).

RIGHT TO SUBSTITUTE SINGLE LENDER

26.5  If:

(a)   any sum payable to any Finance  Party by the Account  Party is required to
      be increased under Clause 10 (TAXES); or

(b)   any Lender claims indemnification from the Account Party under Clause 12.1
      (INCREASED COSTS); or

(c)   a Lender's  Available  Commitment  has been  reduced to zero  pursuant  to
      Clause 13(b) (ILLEGALITY),

the  Account  Party may give the Agent  notice of its  intention  to arrange the
substitution of that Lender with a new bank or financial institution.

On receipt of a notice from the  Account  Party  referred  to above,  the Lender
shall use its best  endeavours to promptly  assign or transfer all of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to an Approved Credit Institution nominated
by the Account Party.  Such transfer will be effected in accordance  with Clause
26.4 (TRANSFER  PROCEDURE) and the  consideration  for such transfer shall be an
amount equal to the sum of all amounts accrued and owing by the Account Party to
the transferring Lender as calculated on the date of transfer.

REFERENCE BANKS

26.6 If a Reference  Bank ceases to be one of the  Lenders,  the Agent shall (in
consultation with the Account Party) appoint another Lender or an affiliate of a
Lender to replace that Reference Bank.

PARTICIPATIONS

26.7 Any Lender may sell participations to one or more Lenders or other entities
(a  PARTICIPANT)  in all or a portion of such  Lender's  rights and  obligations
under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents  (including all or a portion
of its Commitment); PROVIDED that:

(a)   any such  participation  sold to a Participant  which is not a Lender or a
      Lender  Affiliate  shall be made only with the consent (which in each case
      shall not be  unreasonably  withheld) of the Account  Party and the Agent,
      unless an Event of Default under Clause 20(a), (e) or (f) has occurred and
      is continuing, in which case the consent of the Account Party shall not be
      required;

(b)   such  Lender's  obligations  under this  Agreement  and the other  Finance
      Documents shall remain unchanged;

<PAGE>

                                                                  Conformed Copy


(c)   such Lender shall remain solely  responsible  to the other parties  hereto
      for the performance of such obligations;

(d)   the Account Party,  the Agent,  the Security Trustee and the other Lenders
      shall  continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
      with such Lender's  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement and the
      other Finance Documents; and

(e)   the Participant shall agree to the terms of Clause 30.2 (CONFIDENTIALITY).

Any  agreement  or   instrument   pursuant  to  which  a  Lender  sells  such  a
participation  shall  provide  that such Lender  shall  retain the sole right to
enforce  this  Agreement  and the other  Finance  Documents  and to approve  any
amendment,  modification  or waiver of any  provision  of this  Agreement or the
other Finance Documents;  PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide
that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant,  agree to any
amendment,  modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Clause 23.3
(Amendments) that affects such Participant. Subject to Clause 26.8 (NO INCREASED
COSTS),  the  Obligors  agree that each  Participant  shall be  entitled  to the
benefits of Clauses 12 (INCREASED COSTS) and 10 (TAXES) to the same extent as if
it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment  pursuant to Clause
26.3 (TRANSFERS BY LENDERS).

NO INCREASED COSTS

26.8 No  Participant  or  Transferee  shall be  entitled  to receive any greater
payment  under Clause 12  (INCREASED  COSTS) and 10 (TAXES) than the  applicable
Lender would have been  entitled to receive  with  respect to the  participation
sold to such Participant or the Lender interest transferred.

CERTAIN PLEDGES

26.9 Any Lender may at any time  pledge or assign a security  interest in all or
any portion of its rights  under this  Agreement to secure  obligations  of such
Lender,  and this Clause shall not apply to any such pledge or  assignment  of a
security  interest;  PROVIDED  that no such pledge or  assignment  of a security
interest  shall  release  a Lender  from  any of its  obligations  hereunder  or
substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

NO TRANSFERS TO ANY ACCOUNT PARTY OR AFFILIATES

26.10  Anything in this Clause to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  no Lender may
assign or  participate  any interest in any LC Exposure  held by it hereunder to
any Obligor or any of its Affiliates or  Subsidiaries  without the prior consent
of each Lender.

MAINTENANCE OF REGISTER BY THE AGENT

26.11 The Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Account Party, shall
maintain  at one of its  offices in London a copy of each  Transfer  Certificate
delivered to it and a register of the names and  addresses  of the Lenders,  and
the Commitment of, and principal amount of the LC  Disbursements  owing to, each
Lender  pursuant  to the terms  hereof  from time to time  (the  REGISTER).  The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive,  and the Account Party,  the Agent,
the  Security  Trustee  and the  Lenders  may treat  each  Person  whose name is
recorded in the Register  pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this  Agreement,  notwithstanding  notice to the  contrary.  The
Register  shall be available for inspection by any Account Party and any Lender,
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

27.   SET OFF

RIGHT OF SET-OFF

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Finance Party
is hereby  authorised at any time and from time to time,  to the fullest  extent
permitted  by Law,  to set off and apply any and all  deposits  in any  currency
(general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final) at any time held and
other indebtedness in any currency at any time owing by such Finance Party to or
for  the  credit  or the  account  of any  Obligor  against  any of and  all the
obligations of such Obligor now or hereafter  existing under this Agreement held
by such Finance Party,  irrespective  of whether or not such Finance Party shall
have made any demand under this Agreement and although such  obligations  may be
unmatured. The rights of each Finance Party under this Clause are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) which such Finance
Party may have. The relevant  Finance Party may effect any appropriate  currency
exchanges to implement such set-off.

28.   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

CERTIFICATES

concerning any rate or amount under the Finance  Documents shall, in the absence
of manifest error, be conclusive evidence as to that matter.

SURVIVAL

28.2 All  covenants,  agreements,  representations  and  warranties  made by the
Account Party herein and in the certificates or other  instruments  delivered in
connection  with or pursuant to this Agreement  shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other  parties  hereto and shall  survive the  execution  and
delivery of this Agreement and the issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless
of any  investigation  made  by any  such  other  party  or on  its  behalf  and
notwithstanding that the Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default or  incorrect  representation  or warranty at the time any credit is
extended  hereunder,  and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any
fee or any other amount payable under this  Agreement is outstanding  and unpaid

expired or  terminated.  The  provisions  of Clauses 12  (INCREASED  COSTS),  10
(TAXES), 24 (COSTS AND EXPENSES),  25 (INDEMNITIES) and 21 (AGENT) shall survive
and  remain in full  force and  effect  regardless  of the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby, the expiration or termination of the Letters
of Credit  and the  Commitments  or the  termination  of this  Agreement  or any
provision hereof.

COUNTERPARTS

28.3 This Agreement may be executed in  counterparts  (and by different  parties
hereto on separate  counterparts),  each of which shall  constitute an original,
but all of  which  when  taken  together  shall  constitute  one  and  the  same
instrument.

invalid,  illegal  or  unenforceable  in  any  jurisdiction  shall,  as to  such
jurisdiction,  be  ineffective to the extent of such  invalidity,  illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity,  legality and enforceability of
the remaining  provisions hereof. The invalidity of a particular  provision in a
particular  jurisdiction  shall  not  invalidate  such  provision  in any  other

29.4 To the extent that any Obligor has or  hereafter  may acquire any  immunity
from  jurisdiction  of any  court or from any  legal  process  (whether  through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,  attachment in aid of execution
or execution,  on the ground of sovereignty or otherwise) with respect to itself
or its property,  it hereby irrevocably  waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, such immunity in respect of its obligations under the Finance
Documents.

30.   TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY

TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

30.1  Each of the  Obligors  acknowledges  that  from  time  to  time  financial
advisory,  investment  banking and other  services may be offered or provided to
any  Obligor  or one or more of their  Subsidiaries  (in  connection  with  this
Agreement  or  otherwise)  by  any  Lender  or by one or  more  subsidiaries  or
affiliates of such Lender and each of the Obligors hereby authorises each Lender
to share  any  information  delivered  to such  Lender by such  Obligor  and its
Subsidiaries  pursuant to this Agreement,  or in connection with the decision of
such Lender to enter into this  Agreement,  to any such subsidiary or affiliate,
it being  understood  that (a) any such  information  shall be used only for the
purpose of advising  the Obligor or  preparing  presentation  materials  for the
benefit of the Obligor and (b) any such  subsidiary or affiliate  receiving such
information  shall be bound by  Clause  30.2  (CONFIDENTIALITY)  as if it were a
Lender hereunder. Such authorisation shall survive the expiration or termination
of the  Letters  of  Credit  and  the  Commitments  or the  termination  of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

CONFIDENTIALITY

30.2 Each of the Finance Parties agrees to maintain the  confidentiality  of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed:

(a)   to its and its  Affiliates'  directors,  officers,  employees  and agents,
      including  accountants,   legal  counsel  and  other  advisors  (it  being
      understood  that the  Persons  to whom  such  disclosure  is made  will be
      informed of the confidential  nature of such Information and instructed to
      keep such Information confidential);

(b)   to the extent requested by any regulatory  authority  having  jurisdiction
      over the Agent or any Lender;

(c)   to the  extent  required  by  applicable  Laws  or  regulations  or by any
      subpoena or similar legal process;

(d)   to any other Party;

(e)   in  connection  with the exercise of any  remedies  hereunder or any suit,
      action or  proceeding  relating to this  Agreement or the  enforcement  of
      rights hereunder;

(f)   subject to an agreement in writing containing provisions substantially the
      same as those of this paragraph and for the benefit of the Obligor, to (i)
      any  assignee  of or  Participant  in, or any  prospective  assignee of or
      Participant  in, any of its rights or obligations  under this Agreement or
      (ii) any actual or prospective  counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap
      or derivative transaction relating to any Obligor and its obligations;

                                                                  Conformed Copy


(g)   with the consent of the Obligor; or

(h)   to the extent such Information (i) becomes  publicly  available other than
      as a result of a breach of this Clause 30.2 or (ii)  becomes  available to
      the Agent or any Lender on a  non-confidential  basis from a source  other
      than an Obligor.

For the purposes of this Clause, INFORMATION means all information received from
an  Obligor  relating  to an  Obligor  or its  business,  other  than  any  such
information that is available to the Finance Parties on a non-confidential basis
prior to disclosure by such Obligor;  PROVIDED  that, in the case of information
received  from an Obligor  after the date hereof,  such  information  is clearly
identified  at the time of  delivery  as  confidential.  Any Person  required to
maintain the  confidentiality of Information as provided in this Clause shall be
considered  to have  complied  with its  obligation  to do so if such Person has
exercised  the same  degree  of care to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of such
Information  as such Person  would accord to its own  confidential  information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  each of the Finance Parties agree that they will
not  trade  the  securities  of  any  of  the  Obligors  based  upon  non-public
Information that is received by them.

30.3 Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent, the
Lenders  and  the  Account  Party  (and  each  of  their  respective  employees,
representatives  or other  agents) may disclose to any and all persons,  without
limitation  of any kind,  the U.S. tax  treatment  and U.S. tax structure of the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and all  materials  of any  kind
(including  opinions  or other tax  analyses)  that are  provided to such person
relating to such tax treatment or tax structure,  other than any information for
which  nondisclosure is reasonably  necessary in order to comply with applicable
securities  laws, and except that,  with respect to any document or similar item
that in either case contains  information  concerning  the U.S. tax treatment or
U.S.  tax  structure of such  transactions  as well as other  information,  this
paragraph shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that
relate to such tax treatment or tax structure
