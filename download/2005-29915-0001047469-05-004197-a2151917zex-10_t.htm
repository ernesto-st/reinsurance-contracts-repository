<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
designate your beneficiary when you Retire by completing the beneficiary designation section of your enrollment card. If you wish to name more than one beneficiary, you must also
indicate the percentage of your benefit that each beneficiary is to receive. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you do not name a beneficiary, your Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance benefit will be paid to the person you designated under the active employee
Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. If there is no beneficiary designated under that plan, the default beneficiary is your estate. Your failure to designate a beneficiary may delay the
payment of funds. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you wish to change your beneficiary designation, complete a new beneficiary form, available from the Dow Benefits Center. A life event (such as marriage/domestic partnership,
divorce/termination of domestic partnership, etc.) may signal a need to change your beneficiary. Beneficiary changes are not effective until the date received by the Dow Benefits Center. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Section&nbsp;13.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefit Payment</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event of your death, your beneficiary should contact the Retiree Service Center and present a certified copy of your death certificate. See </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claims

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Accelerated Benefit Option, if you have been diagnosed as having a terminal illness, you may receive a portion of your Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance and
Retiree Optional Life Insurance benefits </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>before</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> death. Having access to life proceeds at this important time could help ease financial and emotional
burdens. In order to use ABO, you must be covered for at least $10,000 from your Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or Retiree Optional Life Insurance. You may receive an accelerated
benefit of up to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5,000 and maximum $250,000) of your Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or Retiree Optional Life Insurance if, as a result of an injury or
sickness you are diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and from which there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. A claim form can be obtained from the Dow Benefits Center and
must be completed and returned for evaluation and approval by MetLife. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Section&nbsp;15.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan is funded by an insurance policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("MetLife"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
for Plan Option I, the Participating Employers currently pay the entire cost of the Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. For Plan Option I, the Retiree and the
Participating Employer share the cost. The insurance carrier underwriting the Plans may combine the experience for the policy with other policies held by Dow. This means that the costs of these
coverages may be determined on a combined basis, and the costs accumulated from year to year. Favorable experience under one ore more coverages in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience
on other coverages in the same year or offset unfavorable experience of coverages in prior years. Policy dividends declared by the insurer for the Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan
attributable to Dow's premiums are used to reduce Dow's cost for the coverage in the same and prior years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
designate your beneficiary when you Retire by completing the beneficiary designation section of your enrollment card. If you wish to name more than one beneficiary, you must also
indicate the percentage of your benefit that each beneficiary is to receive. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you do not name a beneficiary, your Retiree Optional Life Insurance benefit will be paid to the beneficiary you designated when you were an active Employee under the
Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan. If you did not designate a beneficiary under the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan, then the Retiree Optional Life Insurance benefit will be
paid to the beneficiary you designated under the Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. If you did not name a beneficiary under the Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan,
your Retiree Optional Life Insurance benefit will be paid to the beneficiary you designated under the active employee Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. If you did not name a beneficiary
under the active employee Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan, the default beneficiary designation is your estate. Your failure to designate a beneficiary may delay the payment of funds. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you wish to change your beneficiary designation, complete a new beneficiary form, available from your Retiree Service Center office. A life event (such as Marriage/Domestic
Partnership, divorce/termination of Domestic Partnership, etc.) may signal a need to change your beneficiary. Beneficiary changes are not effective until the date received by the Retiree Service
Center. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Section 9.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefit Payment</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event of your death, your beneficiary should contact the Retiree Service Center. A certified death certificate must be provided to MetLife to disburse the life insurance proceeds.
See </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claims Procedures Appendix</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of this SPD. Contact the Retiree Service Center at 1-800-344-0661. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Section 10.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accelerated Benefit Option (ABO)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Accelerated Benefit Option, if you have been diagnosed as having a terminal illness, you may receive a portion of your Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance and
Retiree Optional Life Insurance benefits </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>before</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> death. Having access to life proceeds at this important time could help ease financial and emotional
burdens. In order to use ABO, you must be covered for at least $10,000 from your Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or Retiree Optional Life Insurance. You may receive an accelerated
benefit of up to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5,000 and maximum $250,000) of your Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or Retiree Optional Life Insurance if, as a result of an injury or
sickness you are diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and from which there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. A claim form can be obtained from the Retiree Service Center
and must be completed and returned for evaluation and approval by MetLife. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Section 11.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

Plan is funded by an insurance policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("MetLife"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees
pay the entire premium for coverage. The benefits under the Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan and the Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plan are not combined for experience
with the other insurance coverages. Favorable experience under this insurance coverage in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience in prior years. It is not anticipated that there will be
any future dividends declared for the Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan and the Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plan based on the manner in which the insurer has determined the premium rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorinco Reinsurance Company (Dorinco) and MetLife have entered into an arrangement that has been approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in DOL Opinion Letter
97-24A. Under this arrangement, MetLife has or will write the coverage for the Plan, and Dorinco will assume a percentage of the risk. Under the insurance arrangement between MetLife and
Dorinco, MetLife and Dorinco will each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will
transfer its percentage of each death benefit claim to Metropolitan. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will
be obligated to pay the full amount of the claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the
entire amount of the claim. Neither MetLife nor Dorinco will charge the Plan any administrative fees, commissions or other consideration as a result of the participation of Dorinco. This joint
insurance arrangement does not apply to coverage for Retired Hourly Employees who were employed at Michigan Operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever
your coverage decreases under this Plan, you are eligible to convert the amount of coverage you are losing to an individual non-term life insurance policy through
MetLife,&nbsp;Inc. without proof of insurability. You must file&nbsp;a conversion application with MetLife and make the required premium payment to MetLife within 31&nbsp;days of the date your
Dow coverage is lost or decreases. Contact the Dow Retiree Service Center to obtain a form for converting your coverage. Once you have obtained the form, contact the MetLife Conversion Group at
1-800-MET-LIFE or 1-800-638-5433 to file your form, or to obtain further information. </FONT></P>

conversion application must be filed and the required premium payment made to MetLife within 31&nbsp;days of loss of coverage. Your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record or
Dependent child's guardian should contact the Dow Retiree Service Center to obtain a form for converting the coverage. Once the form has been obtained, he or she should contact the MetLife Conversion
Group at 1-800-MET-LIFE or 1-800-638-5433. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cost of this individual coverage will probably be significantly higher than the group plan. Although not required, providing proof of insurability may help reduce the cost. </FONT></P>

will investigate the allegation and respond to you in writing within 120&nbsp;days. If the Plan Administrator determines that your allegation has merit, the Plan Administrator will either correct
the wrong (if it was the Plan which did the wrong), or will make a recommendation to the Plan Sponsor or Participating Employer if any of them have been alleged to be responsible for the wrongdoing.

special circumstances require an extension of time. (The Plan Administrator will give you written notice and reason for the extension.) In no event should the decision take longer than 120&nbsp;days
after receipt of your appeal. If you are not satisfied with the Plan Administrator's response to your appeal, you may file suit in court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must
do so within 120&nbsp;days from the date of the Plan Administrator's written response to your appeal. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
you are a Participant in the Retiree Company-Paid, Retiree Optional or Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plans, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to creating rights for you and all other Plan Participants, ERISA imposes duties on the people who are responsible for operating an employee benefit plan. The people who
operate the Plans, called "fiduciaries" of the Plans, have a duty to act prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
one, including your employer or any other person, may discharge you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan benefit, or from exercising
your rights under ERISA. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the
decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the legal rights described above. For instance, if you request materials from one of the Plans and do not receive them within
30&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the
materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you must
file a written appeal within the time period specified in the Plan's Claims Procedures. Failure to comply with the Plan's claims procedures may significantly jeopardize your rights to benefits. If you
are not satisfied with the final appellate decision, you may file suit in Federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file a lawsuit, you must do so within 120&nbsp;days from the date of the
Claims Administrator's or the Plan Administrator's final written decision (or the deadline the Claims Administrator or Plan Administrator had to notify you of a decision). Failure to file a lawsuit
within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to file a lawsuit.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are
successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse one of the Plan's money, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file a lawsuit, you must do so within
120&nbsp;days from the date of the alleged misuse. Failure to file a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your
waiver of your right to file a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you feel that anyone is discriminating against you for exercising your rights under this benefit plan, or if you feel that someone has interfered with the attainment of any right to
which you feel you are entitled under any of the Plans, you must notify the Plan Administrator listed in the "ERISA Information" section of this SPD in writing within 120&nbsp;days of the date of
the alleged wrongdoing. The Plan Administrator will investigate the allegation and respond to you in writing within 120&nbsp;days. If the Plan Administrator determines that your allegation has
merit, the Plan Administrator will either correct the wrong, if it was the Plan which did the wrong, or will make a recommendation to the Plan Sponsor or Participating Employer if any of them have
been alleged to be responsible for the wrongdoing. If the Plan Administrator determines that your allegation is without merit, you may appeal the Plan Administrator's decision. You must submit written

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you have any questions about the Program, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, you should
contact the nearest Office of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries,
Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>You Must File&nbsp;a Claim in Accordance with These Claims Procedures  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "Claim" is a <U>written</U> request by a claimant for a </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Plan benefit</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> or an </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility
Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. There are two kinds of Claims: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>A </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Claim for Plan Benefits</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a request for benefits covered under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>An
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a kind of Claim. It is a request for a determination as to whether a claimant is eligible to be a Participant or covered
Dependent under the Plan. </FONT></P>

</UL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
must follow the claims procedures for either </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS or CLAIMS FOR AN ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, whichever applies to
your situation. See applicable sections below entitled </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR ELIGIBILITY
DETERMINATIONS.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Who Will Decide Whether to Approve or Deny My Claim?  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dow Chemical Company will approve or deny a Claim for an Eligibility Determination. The initial determination is made by the Dow Benefit Center. If you
appeal, the appellate decision is made by the Director of Global Benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MetLife
will approve or deny a Claim for Plan Benefits. MetLife is the Claims Administrator for both the initial determination and (if there is an appeal), the appellate determination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>An Authorized Representative May Act on Your Behalf  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Authorized Representative may submit a Claim on behalf of a Plan Participant. The Plan will recognize a person as a Plan Participant's "Authorized
Representative" if such person submits a notarized writing signed by the Participant stating that the Authorized Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such Participant. A court order
stating that a person is authorized to submit Claims on behalf of a Participant will also be recognized by the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Authority of the Administrators and Your Rights Under ERISA  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrators have the full, complete, and final discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings of fact in order to carry out their
respective Claims decision-making responsibilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretations
and claims decisions by the Administrators are final and binding on Participants. If you are not satisfied with an Administrator's final appellate decision, you may
file&nbsp;a civil action against the Plan under s. 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in a federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so
within 120&nbsp;days from the date of the Administrator's final written decision. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Information Required In Order to Be a "Claim":  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Claims that are requests for Plan benefits, the claimant must complete a MetLife claims form. Call the Retiree Service Center to obtain a
form&nbsp;1-800/344-0661. In addition, you must attach a certified death certificate (must be certified by the government authority, as exhibited by a "raised seal" on the
certificate). You may request assistance from the Dow Benefits Center (1-989/636-9556) if you need help completing the MetLife claims form. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may submit any additional information to the applicable Administrator when you submit your request for appeal. You may also request that the Administrator provide you copies of
documents, records and other information that is relevant to your Claim, as determined by the applicable Administrator under applicable federal regulations. Your request must be in writing. Such
information will be provided at no cost to you. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the applicable Administrator receives your written request to appeal the initial determination, the Administrator will review your Claim. Deference will not be given to the initial
adverse decision, and the appellate reviewer will look at the Claim anew. The person who will review your appeal will not be the same person as the person who made the initial decision to deny the
Claim. In addition, the person who is reviewing the appeal will not be a subordinate who reports to the person who made the initial decision to deny the Claim. The Administrator will notify you in
writing of its final decision. Such notification will be provided within a reasonable period, not to exceed 60&nbsp;days of the written request for appellate review, except that under special
circumstances, the Administrator may have up to an additional 60&nbsp;days to provide written notification of the final decision. If the Administrator needs such an extension, it will notify you
prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, state the reason why such an extension is needed, and indicate when it will make its determination. If the Administrator determines that it
does not have sufficient information to make a decision on the Claim prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, it will notify you. It will describe any additional material or
information necessary to submit to the Plan, and provide you with the deadline for submitting such information. The initial 60&nbsp;day time period for the Administrator to make a final written
decision, plus the 60&nbsp;day extension period (if applicable) are tolled from the date the notification of insufficiency is sent to you until the date on which it receives your response. ("Tolled"
means the "clock or time is stopped or suspended". In other words, the deadline for the Administrator to make its decision is "put on hold" until it receives the requested information). The tolling
period ends when the Administrator receives your response, regardless of the adequacy of your response. </FONT></P>
