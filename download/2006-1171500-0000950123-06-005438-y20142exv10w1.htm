periods overlap and provided no period commences earlier than the date and time of the happening of
the first recorded individual loss to the Retrocedant in that event.

party shall notify the demanding party of any additional issues to be resolved in the arbitration
and the name of the responding party&#146;s appointed arbitrator. If the responding party refuses or

arbitration demand, then the demanding party may appoint the second arbitrator but only after

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the insolvency of the Retrocedant, this reinsurance shall be payable directly
to the Retrocedant, or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor on the basis
of reported claims allowed against the insolvent Retrocedant by any court in a liquidation
proceeding, without diminution because of the insolvency of the Retrocedant or because the
liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Retrocedant has failed to pay all
or a portion of any claim.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of
the Retrocedant shall give written notice to the Retrocessionaire of the pendency of a claim
against the Retrocedant indicating the Reinsurance Contract reinsured, which claim would involve a
possible liability on the part of the Retrocessionaire within a reasonable time after such claim is
filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during the
pendency of such claim, the Retrocessionaire may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own
expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated any defense or defenses that it
may deem available to the Retrocedant or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory
successor. The expense thus incurred by the Retrocessionaire shall be chargeable, subject to the
approval of the court, against the Retrocedant as part of the expense of conservation or
liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the benefit which may accrue to the Retrocedant
solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Retrocessionaire.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to all reinsurance made, ceded, renewed or otherwise becoming effective under this
Agreement, the reinsurance shall be payable as set forth above by the Retrocessionaire to the
Retrocedant or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor, except (1)&nbsp;where
the Reinsurance Contracts specifically provide another payee in the event of the insolvency of the
Retrocedant, or (2)&nbsp;where the Retrocessionaire with the consent of the insured or reinsureds, has
assumed such Reinsurance Contract obligations of the Retrocedant as direct obligations of the
Retrocessionaire to the payees under such Reinsurance Contracts and in substitution for the
obligations of the Retrocedant to such payees.

competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to the United States District
Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by the laws of the United
States or of any state in the United States. Service of process in such suit may be made upon
