and the Agent and the Lenders have agreed to do so.

      The Revolving Credit Facility made available to the Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement shall be used for residential mortgage loan origination and
acquisition, for mortgage servicing origination and for other general corporate
purposes. In consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable
consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

transactions, consummated on or after the date of this Agreement, by which the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) acquires any going business or all or

otherwise or (ii) directly or indirectly acquires (in one transaction or as the
most recent transaction in a series of transactions) at least a majority (in
number of votes) of the securities of a corporation which have ordinary voting
power for the election of directors (other than securities having such power

shall be deemed to control another Person if the controlling Person possesses,

management or policies of the controlled Person, whether through ownership of
stock, by contract or otherwise.

      "Affiliated Special Ventures" means entities which are Affiliates of the
Borrower engaged in the mortgage business and in which both the Borrower and
another Person have made equity Investments (e.g. a limited liability company
engaged in the mortgage banking business and owned in part by each of the
Borrower and an unrelated third party).

      "Agent" means JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as contractual
representative of the Lenders pursuant to Article X, and not in its individual

      "Aggregate Servicing Value" means, as of any date, an amount equal to (A)
the sum of (1) the then-current Servicing Take-Out Value of all Eligible
Mortgage Servicing Rights set forth in the most recent Servicing Rights
Certificate, plus (2) the then-current amount of Eligible Servicing Sale
Receivables set forth in the most recent Servicing Rights Certificate, minus (B)
the sum of the following, without duplication (1) any applicable reductions from
the total amount of the Take-Out Value of Eligible Mortgage Servicing Rights and
Eligible Sale Receivables set forth in (A) above which result from any payment
made on account of any Eligible Servicing Rights which are sold or the receipt
of any Eligible Servicing Sale Receivable if the applicable sold Eligible
Mortgage Servicing Rights or Servicing Sale Receivables are removed from the
Borrowing Base in accordance with Paragraph 6(c) of the Security Agreement, (2)
any applicable reductions in the amount of Take-Out Value of Eligible Mortgage
Servicing Rights set forth in (A) above which are set forth in a Servicing

forth in (A) above which are set forth in a Reduced Servicing Notice, plus (C)
any applicable increases in the amount of Eligible Sale Receivables described in

if the Agent or the Collateral Agent at any time determines that the amount of
the Servicing Take-Out Value of all Eligible Mortgage Servicing Rights or the
amount of Eligible Servicing Sale Receivables is less than the amount set forth
in (A) above and such discrepancy has not already been accounted for pursuant to
(B) above (e.g. because the Agent or the Collateral Agent has determined that
certain Pledged Servicing or Pledged Servicing Sale Receivables no longer meet
the applicable eligibility criteria, then the Agent or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, shall notify the Borrower of the amount by which the Servicing
Take-Out Value of all Eligible Mortgage Servicing Rights or the amount of

reduced, and the Servicing Take-Out Value of Eligible Mortgage Servicing Rights
or the amount of Eligible Servicing Sale Receivables, as applicable, shall be so
reduced.

                  types of Eligible Collateral may exceed such 50% sublimit so
                  long as the aggregate Borrowing Base value attributable to
                  such three types of Eligible Collateral does not at any time

                  constitute more than fifteen percent (15%) of such Qualifying
                  Negatively Amortizing Loans, based on principal balances and
                  (ii) Low End Qualifying Negatively Amortizing Loans, which
                  shall be included in calculating such 10% sublimit, shall also

the Borrower and any individual Lender (a "Buy-Down Lender") may notify the
Agent in writing that the Borrower and such Buy-Down Lender have entered into a
Buy-Down Agreement with respect to all Loans from time to time outstanding and
held by such Buy-Down Lender, and, that, pursuant to said Buy-Down Agreement,
the interest rate applicable to such Loans during any interest calculation
period shall be the Buy-Down Rate with respect to such Loans and shall be based
on the assumption that the Borrower shall maintain sufficient Available Deposits
with such Buy-Down Lender. The Agent shall (until otherwise notified by the
Borrower and Buy-Down Lender to the contrary) accrue interest on such Loans at
the Buy-Down Rate and the Borrower shall pay such interest in accordance with
Section 2.14. The Agent shall have no obligation to verify the amount of any
Available Deposits supporting the pricing of such Loans held by any Buy-Down
Lender, including without limitation, any deficiency fees or other amounts
payable to such Lender by the Borrower under the applicable Buy-Down Agreement.
The Borrower shall pay all deficiency fees or other amounts payable under its
Buy-Down Agreement with each Buy-Down Lender directly to such Buy-Down Lender
within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a billing statement from such
Buy-Down Lender. Any Buy-Down Lender may elect not to make demand for the
payment of deficiency fees accruing in respect of any shortage of Available
Deposits from time to time and it is expressly agreed and understood that: (1)
any such deficiency fee shall not, by reason of such failure of such Buy-Down
Lender or otherwise, be deemed to have been waived by such Buy-Down Lender
(except as such waiver is expressly acknowledged in writing by such Buy-Down
Lender from time to time), and (2) all deficiency fees accrued and unpaid
hereunder and not so expressly waived, whether or not previously declared due
and owing by any such Buy-Down Lender, shall automatically be due and payable in
full upon the Termination Date.

      2.4 Swingline Advances.

            2.4.1 General. Subject to the terms and conditions herein (including
the Lending Sublimits), the Borrower may request Swingline Advances from the

Borrower shall be funded to the Borrower by the Swingline Lender and in such
amounts as designated in the Borrowing Notice.

            2.4.2 Swingline Advances to Pay Amounts Due to Swingline Lender. If
any amounts are advanced by the Swingline Lender to cover checks or wire
transfers from Borrower accounts maintained with the Swingline Lender when there
are insufficient funds in such accounts to cover the applicable check or wire
transfer and sufficient funds are not deposited in the applicable account before
the close of business on the day on which the applicable check or wire transfer
request is honored, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested, and the
Swingline Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) elect to make, a Swingline
Advance to pay such overdraft amount (even if after giving effect to such a
Swingline Advance the aggregate amount of all outstanding Swingline Advances
would exceed the Swingline Commitment); provided however, that (i) the Swingline
Lender shall not make any such Swingline Advance to the extent such Advance
would cause (x) the aggregate unpaid principal amount outstanding under this
Agreement to exceed the Borrowing Base or (y) the aggregate principal balance of
all outstanding Advances under this Agreement to exceed the Aggregate
Commitment, and

                                       33

<PAGE>

(ii) the reallocations of any such Swingline Advances among the Lenders shall be

            2.4.3 Reallocation of Swingline Advances. The Swingline Lender may
by written notice given to the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such
Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Advances outstanding. Such
notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Advances in which Lenders
will participate. Following receipt of such a notice, the Administrative Agent
will give notice thereof to each Lender by 12:30 p.m., New York City time,
specifying in such notice such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Swingline
Loan. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of
notice as provided above, to pay to the Agent, for the account of the Swingline
Lender, by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, such Lender's Commitment Percentage of
such Swingline Advances. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation
to acquire participations in Swingline Advances pursuant to this paragraph is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction
or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made
without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender
shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.6 with
respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.6 shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Agent shall
promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the
Lenders. The Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any
Swingline Advances acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments
in respect of such Swingline Advances shall be made to the Agent and not to the
Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower
(or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Advances
after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of
participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Agent; any such amounts
received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Agent to
the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and
to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such
payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Agent, as
applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the
Borrower for any reason. If any Lender fails to provide its funds to the Agent
to repay its share of any Swingline Advances when due (including any such
failure caused by a fed funds wire delay), then that Lender shall also be
obligated to pay to the Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender interest
on the unpaid balance of principal so due to the Swingline Lender at the Federal
Funds Effective Rate from such due date until three (3) Business Days after such
due date, and at the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus two percent (2%) from
three (3) Business Days after such due date until the date of payment of such
principal sum. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to
this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment
thereof.

            2.5.1 Facility Fees. A facility fee based on the Aggregate

            Advance, shall be in an amount equal to $5,000,000 or a whole
            multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, or, in the case of a

Business Days written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount
of any such reduction. On or before the effective date of any such reduction,
the Borrower shall, if necessary, repay sufficient Loans to prevent the
remaining outstanding Loans hereunder, after giving effect to such permanent
reduction, from exceeding the Lending Sublimits. Upon any reduction of the
Aggregate Commitment, upon the election of the Swingline

Lender has agreed, in its sole discretion, to provide such an additional
Commitment and provided further that the Borrower shall not be permitted to

the Agent and each Lender increasing its Commitment thereby. Each such amendment
shall amend Schedule 1 to the extent necessary to reflect the changes in the
Commitments hereunder, and the Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of such
amendment to each Lender. On the Business Day that any such increase becomes
effective, all outstanding LIBOR Advances shall be reallocated among the Lenders
in accordance with the Lenders' respective Commitment Percentages.

            2.7.3 Permanent Increases to Aggregate Commitment. The Borrower
shall have the right to permanently increase the Aggregate Commitment to an

agreed, in its sole discretion, to provide such additional Commitment, (B) the
Agent has approved the identity of any such new Lender, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, (C) any such new Lender assumes all of the rights and

excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding LIBOR Advances or (ii) all or any
portion of the outstanding Swingline Advances on any Business Day.

            2.8.2 Required Payments Related to Borrowing Base. On any date that
the aggregate unpaid principal amount outstanding under this Agreement is in
excess of the then-current Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall, prior to the
close of business on such date, either deliver sufficient Eligible Collateral to
eliminate such excess or make a mandatory payment to the Agent for the benefit
of the Lenders in the amount of such excess. Any such payment shall be allocated
in accordance with the Lenders' respective outstanding Loans with such payments
applied to principal.

                                       36

<PAGE>

            2.8.3 Settlement Account Payments. Prior to the occurrence of a
Default, to the extent the amounts in the Settlement Account are not needed to
keep the Borrowing Base equal to or greater than the aggregate unpaid principal
amount outstanding under this Agreement, the Borrower may withdraw or otherwise
direct the application of such amounts. Upon the occurrence of a Default (and
during the continuance thereof), the Agent may declare a portion of the
principal balance of the Loans, equal to any amounts then on deposit in the
Settlement Account and any deposits made in the Settlement Account during the
continuance of such Default, to be due and payable without demand (unless
previously declared due and payable). Such amount shall be withdrawn from the
Settlement Account by the Agent and shall be applied to the Obligations.

            2.8.4 Final Payment on Termination Date. Any outstanding Advances
and all other unpaid Obligations, unless required to be paid earlier pursuant to
the terms hereof, shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the Termination Date.

            2.8.5 Pulte Change in Control. If a Pulte Change in Control shall
occur, all Commitments shall be terminated and all amounts outstanding under
this Agreement shall become due and payable upon the election of the Required
Lenders.

      2.9 Changes in Interest Rate, etc. Each LIBOR Advance shall bear interest
on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the
date such Advance is made but excluding the date it is paid at a rate per annum
equal to the LIBOR Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on each
LIBOR Advance will take effect daily with each change in the LIBOR Rate and
Applicable Margin.

      2.10 Rates Applicable After Default. During the continuance of a Default
the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which
notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any
provision of Section 9.1 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to
reductions in interest rates) declare that each LIBOR Advance shall bear
interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such LIBOR Advance (which rate
includes the Applicable Margin) plus 2% per annum provided that, during the
continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, such increased interest rate
shall be applicable to all LIBOR Advances without any election or action on the
part of the Agent or any Lender.

      2.11 Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be
made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds
to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at
any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in writing by the Agent to
the Borrower, on the date when due by (i) 12:30 p.m. (New York City time) with
respect to all LIBOR Advances and (ii) 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) with
respect to Swingline Advances and all such payments shall be applied in
accordance with Section 2.8. Each payment delivered to the Agent for the account
of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the
same type of funds that the Agent received at its address specified pursuant to
Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by
the Agent from such Lender. The Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account
of the Borrower maintained with JPMC for each payment of principal, interest and
fees as it becomes due hereunder.

      2.12 Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.

            (i) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
      an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
      Lender resulting from each Loan

                                       37

<PAGE>

      made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal
      and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

            (ii) Subject to Section 2.3, the Agent shall also maintain accounts
      in which it will record (a) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (b)
      the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due
      and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (c) the amount
      of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each
      Lender's share thereof.

            (iii) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
      paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of the
      existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided,
      however, that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such
      accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
      obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with
      their terms.

            (iv) Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a Note.
      In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such
      Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans
      evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including
      after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or
      more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein or any assignee
      pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent that any such Lender or
      assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests
      that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (i) and
      (ii) above.

      2.13 Telephonic Notices. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and
the Agent to extend Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices
made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to
be acting on behalf of the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing
authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices to be given
telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written
confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of
each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written
confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Agent
and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent
manifest error.

      2.14 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Subject to Section
2.3, interest accrued on each Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof and at
maturity. Interest and Fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the
basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is
made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is
received at the place of payment prior to the time required for payment as set
forth in Section 2.11. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance
shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal
payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in
connection with such payment.

      2.15 Notification by the Agent. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent
will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction
notice, Borrowing Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.

      2.16 Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending
Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation
from time to time. All terms of this

                                       38

<PAGE>

Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any
Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of
such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and
the Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or
additional Lending Installation through which Loans will be made by it and for
whose account Loan payments are to be made.

      2.17 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Borrower or a Lender,
as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or an Advance or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment
of principal (including but not limited to situations in which the Borrower
informs the Agent that the Agent will be receiving proceeds of Collateral on a
specific date and that the Borrower intends to use such proceeds to make a
payment of principal), interest or Fees to the Agent for the account of the
Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that
such payment has been made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make
the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon
such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in
fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on
demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together
with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the
date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent
recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment due
from a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three
days and, thereafter, either the interest rate provided for in Section 2.3 if
the payment relates to a Swingline Advance or, in all other cases, the interest
rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment due from the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

                                  ARTICLE III
                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

      3.1 Yield Protection. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:

            (i) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to
      any Taxes or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than with
      respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its LIBOR Loans, or

            (ii) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
      assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
      against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
      by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation, or

            (iii) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
      the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making,
      funding or maintaining its LIBOR Loans or reduces any amount receivable by
      any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with its
      LIBOR Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
      to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of its LIBOR
      Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by
      such Lender,

                                       39

<PAGE>

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its LIBOR Loans or
Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending
Installation in connection with such LIBOR Loans or Commitment, then, within 15
days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduction in an amount received.

      3.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand by such
Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate
for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital
which such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its
Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's
policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the date
of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of
or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force
of law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation
or any corporation controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means
(i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date
of this Agreement, including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding
capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United
States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking
Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence of
Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any
amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

      3.3 Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines that
maintenance of its LIBOR Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate
any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the
force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits of a type
and maturity appropriate to match fund LIBOR Advances are not available or (ii)
the interest rate applicable to a Type of Advance does not accurately reflect
the cost of making or maintaining such Advance, then the Agent shall suspend the
availability of the affected Type of Advance and require any Advances of the
affected Type to be repaid.

      3.4 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of
the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then
(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) the Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)
the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the
full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.

      (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

      (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender, within 10 days
after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes paid by the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with
respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation

                                       40

<PAGE>

of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate prepared in good faith and setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis and amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a
Lender, or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

      (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to
the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such
Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting
such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the
Agent.

      (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction
of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is
located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to
payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly
completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate.

      (f) If the Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it
has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.4, it shall pay over such refund
to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.4 with respect to
the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket
expenses of the Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Agent or such
Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any
penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to the Agent or such Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall
not be construed to require the Agent or any Lender to make available its tax
returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

            3.5 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any
Lender requests compensation under Section 3.1 or Section 3.2, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.4,
then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in
the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate
or reduce amounts payable pursuant to such Sections in the future and (ii) would
not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any
such designation or assignment.

      (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.1 or Section 3.2,
or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.4, or
if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder,

                                       41

<PAGE>

then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such
Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 12.3), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Agent, which consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in
Swingline Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts
payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all
other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a
claim for compensation under Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 or payments required to
be made pursuant to Section 3.4, such assignment will result in a reduction in
such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT; WITHHOLDING TAX EXEMPTION

      4.1 Effectiveness. This Agreement shall not be effective and no Lender
shall be required to make the initial Advance hereunder until a date (the
"Effective Date") upon which the Borrower has furnished or caused to be
furnished to the Agent:

            (i) Copies of the articles or certificate of organization of the
      Borrower, together with all amendments, certified by the appropriate
      governmental officer in its jurisdiction of organization.

            (ii) Copies, certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of
      the Borrower, of its operating or other management agreement and of
      resolutions of its members and of any other body authorizing the execution
      of the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party.

            (iii) An incumbency certificate, executed by the Secretary or
      Assistant Secretary of the Borrower, which shall identify by name and
      title and bear the signatures of the Authorized Officers and any other
      officers of the Borrower authorized to sign the Loan Documents to which
      the Borrower is a party, upon which certificate the Agent and the Lenders
      shall be entitled to rely until informed of any change in writing by the
      Borrower.

            (iv) A good standing certificate for the Borrower from the Secretary
      of State of its state of organization.

            (vi) A written opinion of the Borrower's counsel, addressed to the
      Lenders in a form acceptable to Agent.

      executed UCC-1 financing statements as the Agent may reasonably request.

            (ix) Copies of the existing Acknowledgment Agreements with respect

      regarding the Borrower's hedges as the Agent may have reasonably
      requested.

            (xii) Such other documents as any Lender or its counsel may have
      reasonably requested.

      4.2 Each Advance. The Lenders shall not be required to make any Advance
(other than an Advance that, after giving effect thereto and to the application
of the proceeds thereof, does not increase the aggregate amount of outstanding
Advances), unless on the applicable Borrowing Date:

            (i) There exists no Default or Unmatured Default.

            (ii) The representations and warranties contained in Article V are
      true and correct in all material respects as of such Borrowing Date except

      shall have been true and correct in all material respects on and as of
      such earlier date.

            (iii) All legal matters incident to the making of such Advance shall
      be reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders and their counsel.

      Each Borrowing Notice with respect to each such Advance shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower that each Pledged Item included in
the Borrowing Base constitutes Eligible Collateral, and that after giving effect
to the amount of the Advance being requested, (a) the conditions contained in
Sections 4.2(i) and (ii) have been satisfied, (b) the Borrower has provided the
Collateral Agent with the true and correct information including the GAAP
Carrying Values (correctly calculated in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement) necessary to calculate the Collateral Value for all Eligible
Collateral, (c) the then current Borrowing Base is equal to or greater than the
aggregate unpaid principal amount outstanding under this Agreement and (d) no
Lending Sublimit or Borrowing Base Sublimit has been exceeded.

                                   ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

      5.1 Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or limited liability
company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly
existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization
and,

                                       43

<PAGE>

except for the State of Rhode Island, has all requisite authority to conduct its
business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted. The failure of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries to be authorized to conduct business in Rhode
Island could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      5.2 Authorization and Validity. The Borrower has the power and authority
to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to perform its obligations
thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents and
the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by
proper limited liability company proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which
the Borrower is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except
as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

      5.3 No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and delivery by
the Borrower of the Loan Documents nor the consummation of the transactions
therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate
(i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or
award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries if any such violation
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business
or financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or
(ii) the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate of
incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or
certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating or other management
agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture,
instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with
or constitute a default thereunder if any such violation, conflict or default
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business
or financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or
result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the
Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such
indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval,
license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration
with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public
body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under this Agreement, the payment
and performance by the Borrower of the Obligations or the legality, validity,
binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents (other than
filings to perfect the Liens granted pursuant to the Security Agreement).

      5.4 Financial Statements. The December 31, 2005 consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to the
Lenders were prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect on the date such
statements were prepared and fairly present the consolidated financial condition
and operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries at such date and the
consolidated results of their operations for the period then ended.

      5.5 Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 2005, there has been no
change in the business, Property, financial condition or results of operations
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

      5.6 Taxes. The Borrower and, to its knowledge, its Subsidiaries have filed
all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are
required to be filed and have paid all taxes due

                                       44

<PAGE>

pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which adequate reserves have
been provided in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles and as to which
no Lien exists. No material tax liens have been filed and no material claims are
being asserted with respect to any such taxes. The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries in respect of any
taxes or other governmental charges are adequate. Each of the Borrower and each
of its Subsidiaries that is a limited liability company qualifies for
disregarded entity tax treatment under United States federal tax law.

      5.7 Litigation and Contingent Obligations. Except as set forth on Schedule
"3" hereto and as otherwise disclosed in the Borrower's annual financial
statements referred to in Section 5.4, there is no litigation, arbitration,
governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to the knowledge
of any of their executive officers, threatened against or affecting the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries which (i) in the Borrower's reasonable judgment have
a reasonable possibility of being determined adversely to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary, and (ii) if so determined adversely to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary, as the case may be, would be reasonably likely to, singly or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, or on the
respective properties or operations, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Security
Agreement and the Notes. Other than any liability incident to any litigation,
arbitration or proceeding which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower has no material contingent obligations not
provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section
5.4.

      5.8 Subsidiaries. Schedule "4" hereto contains an accurate list of all
Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth
their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their
respective capital stock or other ownership interests owned by the Borrower or
other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the extent such
concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership interests) duly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

      5.9 ERISA. The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans do not in
the aggregate exceed $500,000. Neither the Borrower nor any other member of the
Controlled Group has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur, any
withdrawal liability to Multi-employer Plans in excess of $500,000 in the
aggregate. Each Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of law and regulations, no Reportable Event has occurred with
respect to any Plan, neither the Borrower nor any other members of the
Controlled Group has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated steps to do so, and no
steps have been taken to reorganize or terminate any Plan.

      5.10 Accuracy of Information. No information, exhibit or report furnished
by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or to any Lender in
connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan Documents
contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a material fact
or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading.

      5.11 Regulation U. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) constitutes
less than 25% of the value of those assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other restriction
hereunder.

      5.12 Material Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which could reasonably

                                       45

<PAGE>

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of
the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in (i) any agreement to which
it is a party, which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing
Indebtedness or any Rate Management Transaction.

      5.13 Compliance With Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have complied
with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any
domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or agency thereof, having
jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership of
their respective Property except for any failure to comply with any of the
foregoing which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

      5.14 Ownership of Properties. Except as set forth on Schedule "5" hereto,
on the date of this Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will have good
title, free of all Liens other than those permitted by Section 6.15, to all of
the Property and assets reflected in the financial statements provided to the
Agent as owned by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

      5.15 Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions. The Borrower is not an entity
deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101
of an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) which is
subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of Section 4975 of
the Code), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the making of Loans
hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

      5.16 Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is an
"investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

      5.17 Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended.

      5.18 GNMA, FHA, VA, FNMA, and FHLMC Eligibility. The Borrower is: (i) an
FHA-Approved Mortgagee in good standing, a VA-Approved Lender, a FHLMC-Approved
Lender and a FNMA-Approved Lender and meets all eligible requirements of law and
governmental regulation so as to be eligible to originate, purchase, hold and
service Mortgage Loans insured by FHA or supporting any Security; (ii) an
approved seller and servicer in good standing of Mortgage Loans to each Federal
Agency; and (iii) an approved issuer and servicer in good standing of Securities
for FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA and meets all FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA requirements,
requirements of law and governmental regulations so as to be able to issue
Securities and to originate and service the Mortgage Loans that secure such
Securities.

      5.19 Approved Investor Commitments. The forms of Approved Investor
Commitment with respect to Mortgage Loans, other than Conforming Mortgage Loans,
which were delivered to the Agent on the Effective Date are still valid and
currently in use and, except to the extent new forms or changes to the existing
forms of Approved Investor Commitment have been delivered to the Agent,
represent the only forms of Approved Investor Commitment used by the Borrower
for such purposes.

                                       46

      5.20 Accuracy of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Borrower contained in each other document delivered in
connection with this Agreement are, or when such document is delivered will be,
true and correct in all material respects when made.

      5.21 No Defaults. No Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is
continuing.

      5.22 USA Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for
itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that
pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56
(signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain,
verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information
includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will
allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the
Borrower in accordance with the Act.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                    COVENANTS

      During the term of this Agreement, unless the Required Lenders shall
otherwise consent in writing:

      6.1 Financial Reporting. The Borrower will maintain, for itself and each
Subsidiary, a system of accounting established and administered in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and furnish to the Lenders:

            (i) Within 120 days after the close of each of its fiscal years, an
      unqualified audit report certified by independent certified public
      accountants, reasonably acceptable to the Lenders, prepared in accordance
      with Agreement Accounting Principles on a consolidated basis for itself
      and the Subsidiaries, including balance sheets as of the end of such
      period, related profit and loss and changes in shareholders' equity
      statements, and a statement of cash flows, accompanied by any management
      letter prepared by said accountants.

            (ii) Within 15 days after the close of each month of each of its
      fiscal years, for itself and its Subsidiaries, consolidated unaudited
      balance sheets as at the close of each such period and consolidated profit
      and loss statements (showing a breakout of servicing sales gains
      attributed to servicing originated in prior periods), a change in
      shareholders equity statement for the period from the beginning of such
      fiscal year to the end of such month, all certified (subject to normal
      year-end adjustments) by an Authorized Officer.

            (iii) Together with the financial statements required under Sections
      6.1(i) and (ii), a compliance certificate in substantially the form of
      Exhibit "F" hereto signed by an Authorized Officer showing the
      calculations necessary to determine compliance with this Agreement as
      currently in effect (regardless of whether this Agreement was in effect at
      the date for which such financial statements were prepared) and that no
      Default or Unmatured Defaults exists, or if any Default or Unmatured
      Default exists, stating the nature and status thereof.

            (iv) As soon as available but in any event within fifteen (15) days
      after the end of each calendar month, a servicing report and analysis
      which shall show the status of all mortgages serviced by the Borrower
      including those which are delinquent, all in such form and detail and
      including such additional information as the Agent may reasonably request.
      Such

                                       47

<PAGE>

      servicing report shall show separately information concerning any
      mortgages or securities with respect to which there is recourse to the
      Borrower.

            (v) As soon as available but in any event within fifteen (15) days
      after the end of each month, a secondary marketing report for such month
      reasonably satisfactory to the Agent (each such report, a "Positions
      Report"), which shall include a schedule setting forth (A) the components
      of the Borrower's Hedging Program as of the end of such month, (B) the
      Approved Investor Commitments as of the end of such month, (C) the amount
      of Non-Agency Mortgage Loans in each group having a similar rate type and
      duration as of the end of such month and (D) the Qualifying Rate Hedges
      applicable to the various groups of Non-Agency Mortgage Loans as of the
      end of such month. The Positions Report shall be presented on a consistent
      basis and shall be included with the monthly statements delivered pursuant
      to Subsection 6.1(ii) above. If the Borrower at any time determines that
      the Qualifying Rate Hedges with respect to any group of Non-Agency
      Mortgage Loans, taken together with the Approved Investor Commitments
      applicable to such group of Non-Agency Mortgage Loans, does not fully
      cover such group of Non-Agency Mortgage Loans, then the Borrower shall
      immediately notify the Agent of such fact.

            (vi) Within five (5) Business Days after request of Agent, copies of
      all documents submitted in connection with any audits by any of FNMA,
      FHLMC or GNMA; within ten (10) Business Days after request of Agent,
      copies of all compliance and audit reports received from any of FNMA,
      FHLMC or GNMA; and promptly upon receipt, a copy of any notice from (i)
      any Federal Agency to the effect that it is or is contemplating
      withdrawing its approval of the Borrower as a FHA-Approved Mortgagee,
      FHLMC-Approved Lender, FNMA-Approved Lender or VA-Approved Lender or as an
      approved seller and servicer for FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA or (ii) any private
      mortgage insurer which insures any of the Collateral to the effect that it
      is contemplating withdrawing its approval of the Borrower as an approved
      originator of insured Mortgage Loans.

            (vii) Within 270 days after the close of each fiscal year, a
      statement of the Unfunded Liabilities of each Single Employer Plan,
      certified as correct by an actuary enrolled under ERISA.

            (viii) As soon as possible and in any event within 10 days after the
      Borrower knows that any Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any
      Plan, a statement, signed by an Authorized Officer, describing said
      Reportable Event and the action which the Borrower proposes to take with
      respect thereto.

            (ix) As soon as possible and in any event within 10 days after
      receipt by the Borrower, a copy of (a) any notice or claim to the effect
      that the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be liable to any
      Person as a result of the release by the Borrower, any of its
      Subsidiaries, or any other Person of any toxic or hazardous waste or
      substance into the environment, and (b) any notice alleging any violation
      of any federal, state or local environmental, health or safety law or
      regulation by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, which, in either
      case, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (x) Promptly upon the furnishing thereof to the shareholders of the
      Borrower, copies of all financial statements, reports and proxy statements
      so furnished.

                                       48

<PAGE>

            (xi) Promptly upon the filing thereof, copies of all registration
      statements and annual, quarterly, monthly or other regular reports which
      the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries files with the Securities and
      Exchange Commission.

            (xii) Such other information (including non-financial information)
      as the Agent or any Lender may from time to time reasonably request.

            (xiii) Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month, the
      Borrower shall deliver to the Agent and the Collateral Agent a report
      (each such report, a "Servicing Rights Certificate") setting forth (A) the
      Servicing Take-Out Value of the Eligible Mortgage Servicing Rights as of
      the end of such month, which amount shall be computed in accordance with
      the values contemplated for such servicing under the terms of a valid
      Approved Servicing Sale Agreement and in accordance with FAS 140 with
      appropriate deductions, if any, necessary to account for any capitalized
      servicing rights which may be shown on the Borrower's balance sheet but
      which do not constitute Eligible Mortgage Servicing Rights (whether due to
      failure to satisfy all of the eligibility requirements of the effect of
      borrowing base sublimits, or otherwise), and (B) the amount of the
      Eligible Servicing Sale Receivables as of the end of such month; which
      report shall be presented on a consistent basis and in accordance with
      GAAP. If title to any servicing rights constituting Eligible Mortgage
      Servicing Rights is to be transferred by the Borrower and the sum of the
      resulting initial purchase price payment to be made directly to the Cash
      and Collateral Account (if any) and Eligible Servicing Sale Receivable (if
      any) will be less than the Servicing Take-Out Value of the Eligible
      Mortgage Servicing Rights so sold, the Borrower shall deliver a report (a
      "Servicing Transfer Report") to the Agent and the Collateral Agent on or
      prior to the date of transfer of title to the Eligible Mortgage Servicing
      Rights indicating (i) the amount of the resulting reduction in the
      Servicing Take-Out Value, (ii) the amount of the initial purchase price
      payment to be made if such payment is to be made to the Cash and
      Collateral Account, and (iii) the amount of the resulting Eligible
      Servicing Sale Receivable, if any (which report shall be certified as to
      fairness of presentation, Agreement Accounting Principles and consistency
      by an Authorized Officer). If the Borrower at any time determines that the
      amount of the Take-Out Value of Eligible Mortgage Servicing Rights or the
      amount of Eligible Servicing Sale Receivables is less than the amounts of
      such Collateral that are then included in the calculation of Aggregate
      Servicing Value (e.g. because the Borrower has determined that certain
      Pledged Servicing or Servicing Sale Receivables no longer meet the
      applicable eligibility criteria), then the Borrower shall immediately
      notify the Agent and the Collateral Agent of the applicable change (a
      "Reduced Servicing Notice").

            (xiv) Upon request from time to time from the Agent, copies of the
      forms of Approved Investor Commitments that the Borrower is then utilizing
      for its Approved Investors.

      6.2 Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
only use the proceeds of the Advances for the purposes described in the recitals
hereto, to pay interest, Fees, expenses and other Obligations, to pay
Indebtedness of the Borrower existing on the date hereof and to repay
outstanding Advances. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary
to, use any of the proceeds of the Advances to purchase or carry any "margin
stock" (as defined in Regulation U) or to make any Acquisition (other than those
permitted by Section 6.14) or to make any Acquisition for which the board of
directors of the Person being acquired has not consented to such Acquisition.

      6.3 Notice of Default. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary
to, give prompt notice in writing to the Lenders of the occurrence of any
Default or Unmatured Default and of any other

                                       49

<PAGE>

development, financial or otherwise, which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

      6.4 Conduct of Business. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary
to, carry on and conduct its business in substantially the same manner and in
substantially the same fields of enterprise as it is presently conducted. The
Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary which is a material part of the
Borrower's overall business operations to, do all things necessary to remain
duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and (to the extent such concept
applies to such entity) in good standing as a domestic corporation, partnership
or limited liability company in its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, and maintain all requisite authority to
conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
The Borrower will use best efforts to adhere in all material respects to
customary practices and standards in the industry insofar as adherence to such
practices and standards would require the Borrower to cause obligors whose
indebtedness is secured by Pledged Mortgages to comply with their obligations
under such Pledged Mortgages with respect to the real estate securing such
indebtedness, including without limitation, the payment of all taxes and
insurance premiums related thereto and maintenance of such real estate in
compliance with all laws.

      6.5 Taxes. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to, timely
file complete and correct United States federal and applicable foreign, state
and local tax returns required by law and pay when due all taxes, assessments
and governmental charges and levies upon it or its income, profits or Property,
except those which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and with respect to which adequate reserves have been set aside in accordance
with Agreement Accounting Principles. At any time that the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries is organized as a limited liability company, each such limited
liability company will qualify for disregarded entity tax treatment under United
States federal tax law.

      6.6 Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance on
all their Property in such amounts and covering such risks as is consistent with
sound business practice, and the Borrower will furnish to any Lender upon
request full information as to the insurance carried. The Borrower will at all
times, upon request of the Agent, furnish to the Agent copies of its, and each
of its Subsidiaries', current Mortgage Bankers Blanket Bond and of its, and each
of its Subsidiaries', insurance policy containing errors and omissions coverage
or mortgage impairment coverage, and such Bonds and policies, to the extent
possible, shall each provide that it is not cancelable without thirty (30) days
prior written notice to the Agent.

      6.7 Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs,
judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject, including,
without limitation, all Environmental Laws, non-compliance with which could,
singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business or financial condition of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, unless the same shall be contested by the
Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings and such contest shall operate to stay the material
adverse effect of any such non-compliance.

      6.8 Maintenance of Properties. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, do all things necessary to maintain, preserve, protect and keep
its Property in good repair, working order and

                                       50

<PAGE>

condition, and make all necessary and proper repairs, renewals and replacements
so that its business carried on in connection therewith may be properly
conducted at all times.

      6.9 Inspection. Upon reasonable prior notice, the Borrower will, and will
cause each Subsidiary to, permit the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the
Lenders, by their respective representatives and agents, to inspect any of the
Property, books and financial records of the Borrower and each Subsidiary, to
examine and make copies of the books of accounts and other financial records of
the Borrower and each Subsidiary, and to discuss the affairs, finances and
accounts of the Borrower and each Subsidiary with, and to be advised as to the
same by, their respective officers at such reasonable times and intervals as the
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may designate; provided that the
Secured Parties shall exercise the foregoing rights in a manner which is not
unreasonably disruptive to the business or operations of the Borrower.

      6.10 Dividends. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary
to, declare or pay any dividends or make any distributions on its capital stock
(other than dividends payable in its own capital stock or cash distributions
from any Subsidiary to the Borrower) or redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire
or retire any of its capital stock at any time outstanding, (collectively,
"Restricted Payments") if any Default continues or if after giving effect to the
making of any such Restricted Payment a Default or an Unmatured Default would
exist.

      6.11 Intentionally Omitted.

      6.12 Merge. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to,
merge or consolidate with or into any other Person, except that a Subsidiary may
merge into the Borrower or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary. The Borrower may, after
prior written notice to the Agent and Lenders, take such action with respect to
any Subsidiary which is not a material part of the Borrower's overall business
operations.

      6.13 Sale of Assets. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any
Subsidiary to, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of its Property, to any other
Person, except:

            (i) Sales of Mortgage Loans, Securities and Servicing Rights in the
      ordinary course of business.

            (ii) Leases, sales or other dispositions of its Property that,
      together with all other Property of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
      previously leased, sold or disposed of (other than Mortgage Loans and
      Securities in the ordinary course of business) as permitted by this
      Section during the twelve-month period ending with the month in which any
      such lease, sale or other disposition occurs, do not constitute a
      Substantial Portion of the Property of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

            (iii) Transfers of a Subsidiary's assets to another Subsidiary or to
      the Borrower.

      6.14 Investments and Acquisitions. The Borrower will not, nor will it
permit any Subsidiary to, make or suffer to exist any Investments (including
without limitation, loans and advances to, and other Investments in,
Subsidiaries), or commitments therefor, or to create any Subsidiary or to become
or remain a partner in any partnership or joint venture, or to make any
Acquisition of any Person, except:

                                       51

<PAGE>

            (i) Cash Equivalent Investments.

            (ii) Existing Investments in Subsidiaries and other Investments in
      existence on the date hereof and described in Schedule "4" hereto.

            (iii) Investments in the ordinary course of the Borrower's mortgage
      banking business to purchase: (a) Mortgage Loans, collateralized mortgage
      obligations and Securities (and in connection with commitments to purchase
      the same); (b) servicing rights and mortgage servicing contracts of
      another Person engaged in mortgage-related businesses; and (c) real estate
      acquired by foreclosure.

            (iv) Investments in the ordinary course of the Borrower's mortgage
      banking business in the form of Rate Management Transactions to the extent
      permitted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

            (v) Investments in Affiliated Special Ventures.

            (vi) Investments in Joliet Mortgage Reinsurance Company.

            (vii) Investments in the aggregate in Pulte Funding, Inc., a
      wholly-owned subsidiary of the Borrower.

            (viii) Investments other than those described in the preceding
      clauses (i)-(vii), so long as the aggregate amount of all such other
      Investments does not exceed $1,000,000.

      6.15 Liens. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to,
create, incur, or suffer to exist any Lien in, of or on the Property of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except:

            (i) Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges or levies
      on its Property if the same shall not at the time be delinquent or
      thereafter can be paid without penalty, or are being contested in good
      faith and by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves in
      accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles shall have been set aside
      on its books.

            (ii) Liens imposed by law, such as carriers', warehousemen's and
      mechanics' liens and other similar liens arising in the ordinary course of
      business which secure payment of obligations not more than 60 days past

      8.4 Cash and Collateral Account; Settlement Account; Reconciliation
Process.

            (i) The Borrower has established in its name a "cash and collateral"
      account with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Account #1928368 (the "Cash and
      Collateral Account") into which shall be deposited all cash proceeds from
      the sale of any Pledged Item and of certain collateral under the "CP
      Facility", all as described in the Collection and Paying Agreement. Only
      JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. shall have access to the Cash and Collateral
      Account.

            (ii) There may hereafter be established with the Agent, for the
      benefit of the Secured Parties, a separate "cash collateral" account of
      the Borrower ("Settlement Account") into which shall, in certain
      circumstances, be deposited certain cash proceeds from the Cash and
      Collateral Account as described herein and in the Collection and Paying
      Agreement. The Settlement Account shall be included in the Collateral and
      the Borrower hereby pledges and assigns to the Agent for the benefit of
      the Secured Parties and grants to the Agent for the benefit of the Secured
      Parties, a first priority security interest in the Settlement Account to

            (iii) No later than 4:30 p.m. (New York City time) each Business Day
      the Borrower shall notify the Agent and the Collateral Agent of the amount
      of Reconciled Non-Security Proceeds deposited into the Cash and Collateral
      Account since the report of Reconciled Non-Security Proceeds on the prior
      Business Day, and (so long as no Default is continuing and the Borrowing
      Base is equal to or greater than the total outstanding Loans) the Agent
      shall transfer such newly deposited Reconciled Non-Security Proceeds into
      the Borrower's operating account or apply them as otherwise directed by
      the Borrower. Any Excess Pool Proceeds shall (so long as no Default is
      continuing and the Borrowing Base is equal to or greater than the total
      outstanding Loans) also be transferred into the Borrower's operating
      account or applied as otherwise directed by the Borrower. If the Borrowing
      Base is not equal to or greater than the total outstanding Loans, then the
      Agent shall apply the necessary amount of the Reconciled Non-Security
      Proceeds and/or Excess Pool Proceeds against the outstanding Loans so that
      the Borrowing Base equals the total outstanding Loans. Such application
      shall be made first to repay any outstanding Overadvances (as defined in
      Paragraph 6(d) of the Security Agreement) and then to repay then
      outstanding Loans in the order and in the amounts directed by the Borrower
      or, in the absence of such direction, in the following order: (i) first,
      to Swingline Loans until paid in full, (ii) second, to LIBOR Loans

      been repaid before being applied to principal of other LIBOR Loans .

            (iv) Upon the occurrence of a Default (and during the continuance
      thereof) all amounts then on deposit in the Cash and Collateral Account or
      the Settlement Account which constitute Collateral or the proceeds
      thereof, and any deposits made in the Cash and Collateral Account or the
      Settlement Account which constitute Collateral or the proceeds thereof
      during the continuance of such Default, shall be immediately withdrawn by
      the Agent from the Cash and Collateral Account and the Settlement Account
      and applied to outstanding Loans in proportion to the Lenders' respective
      outstanding Loans and (with respect to the Lenders) in

                                       59
<PAGE>

      conjunction with the procedures described in Section 2.6, with such
      payments applied first to accrued interest and fees and thereafter to
      principal.

      8.5 Termination. If all Commitments under this Agreement shall have
expired or been terminated pursuant to the express terms hereof and no
Obligations shall be outstanding, the Agent shall promptly deliver or cause to
be delivered all cash standing to the credit of the Cash and Collateral Account
and the Settlement Account and all Pledged Items to the Borrower. The receipt by
the Borrower of any cash in the Cash and Collateral Account and the Settlement
Account and of all Pledged Items returned or delivered to the Borrower pursuant
to any provision of this Agreement, together with UCC-3 termination statements
executed by the Agent, shall be a complete and full acquittance for the Pledged
Items so delivered.

      8.6 Acceleration. If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs
with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately
become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the Agent
or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or the Agent
with the consent of the Required Lenders) may (i) terminate or suspend the
obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and they shall, upon notice
to the Borrower, terminate or be suspended, and/or (ii) declare the Obligations
to be due and payable, whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due
and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of
which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

      8.7 Other Remedies.

            (i) Unless a Default shall have occurred and then be continuing, the
      Borrower shall be entitled to receive and collect directly all sums
      payable to the Borrower in respect of the Collateral except proceeds from
      the sale thereof.

            (ii) Upon the occurrence of a Default, the Agent and the Collateral
      Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, shall be entitled to all the rights and
      remedies hereunder and in the Security Agreement, subject to the
      limitations and requirements of Paragraph 16 thereof, and all other rights
      or remedies at law or in equity existing or conferred upon the Lenders by
      other jurisdictions or other applicable law.

            (iii) Following the occurrence and during the continuance of a
      Default, no Lender shall be obligated to fund any Loan hereunder.

            (iv) Following the occurrence a Default, the Borrower agrees that
      the Borrower and the Agent shall, if the Agent shall request implement
      certain procedures with respect to the Borrower's funding of AP Mortgages,
      all at the Borrower's sole expense. Such procedures may include, but are
      not limited to: (i) reducing the advance rate against any Eligible
      Collateral for purposes of determining the Collateral Value component of
      the Borrowing Base, (ii) requiring that if AP Mortgages are funded with
      wire transfers, such wire transfers originate from a controlled account
      maintained by the Agent and may only be released upon the secondary
      authorization of the Agent, (iii) requiring the closing agents for such AP
      Mortgages to enter into escrow or other agreements regarding the monies
      used to fund such AP Mortgages, and (iv) requiring the Borrower to provide
      the Agent and the Lenders with such information regarding the funding of
      such AP Mortgages as the Agent may reasonably request. The Borrower, at
      its expense, shall from time to time execute and deliver to the Agent or
      the Collateral Agent all

                                       60
<PAGE>

      such assignments, certificates, supplemental documents, and financing
      statements, and shall do all other acts or things, as the Agent may
      reasonably request in order to more fully implement such procedures.

            (v) The Borrower waives, to the extent permitted by law, any right
      to require the Agent or any Lender to (i) proceed against any Person, (ii)
      proceed against or exhaust any of the Collateral or pursue its rights and
      remedies as against the Collateral in any particular order or (iii) pursue
      any other remedy in its power.

            (vi) The Agent on behalf of the Lenders may, but shall not be
      obligated to, advance any sums or do any act or thing necessary to uphold
      and enforce the lien and priority of, or the security intended to be
      afforded by, any Pledged Item, including, without limitation, payment of
      delinquent taxes or assessments and insurance premiums. The Borrower shall
      provide any and all information required by the Agent to administer this
      Agreement or collect on the Collateral. All advances, charges, costs and
      expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred or paid by the
      Agent in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this
      Agreement, or in the enforcement hereof (or by any Lender acting on
      instruction of the Required Lenders in the enforcement hereof), together
      with interest thereon at the rate per annum of 2% plus the LIBOR Rate from
      the time of payment until repaid, shall become a part of the Obligations.

            (vii) Following the occurrence of a Default and the acceleration of
      the Obligations the Agent shall be entitled to receive and collect all
      sums payable to the Borrower in respect of the Collateral and (a) the
      Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, may in its own name or in
      the name of the Borrower or otherwise, demand, sue for, collect or receive
      any money or property at any time payable or receivable on account of or
      in exchange for any of the Collateral, (b) the Borrower shall receive and
      hold in trust for the Lenders any amounts thereafter received by the
      Borrower upon or in respect of any of the Collateral, advising the Agent
      as to the source of such funds and, if the Agent so requests at the
      direction of the Required Lenders, forthwith paying such amounts to the
      Agent, and (c) any and all amounts so received and collected by the Agent
      either directly or from the Borrower shall be deposited in the Cash and
      Collateral Account or the Settlement Account.

      8.8 Application of Proceeds. After a Default and acceleration of the
Obligations, the proceeds of any sale or enforcement of all or any part of the
Collateral pursuant to the Security Agreement and the balance of any moneys in
the Cash and Collateral Account or the Settlement Account shall be applied by
the Agent:

            FIRST, to the extent that any such proceeds arise from a sale of any
      Pledged Servicing, to the payment of any amounts due by the Borrower to
      the other party to the Servicing Agreements governing such Pledged
      Servicing, as a condition to the transfer of the Borrower's interest in
      any such Pledged Servicing, pursuant to the terms of such Servicing
      Agreements, including without limitation all amounts described in the
      Acknowledgement Agreements;

            SECOND, to the extent not already repaid from the proceeds of the
      Collateral by the Collateral Agent, to the payment of all costs and
      expenses of such sale or enforcement, including reasonable compensation to
      the Agent's agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances
      made or incurred by the Agent or any Lender acting on instructions of the
      Required Lenders in connection therewith;

                                       61
<PAGE>

            THIRD, to the extent not already repaid from the proceeds of the
      Collateral by the Collateral Agent, to the payment of all costs and
      expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement;

            FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of, and
      all accrued and unpaid interest on and Fees attributable to, all Loans
      under this Agreement, ratably according to the amount so due to each
      Lender until such amounts are paid in full;

            FIFTH, to the extent proceeds remain after application under the
      preceding subparagraphs, to the payment of all remaining Obligations,
      until such amounts are paid in full;

            SIXTH, to the extent that any such proceeds arise from a sale of any
      Pledged Servicing and remain after satisfying the prior amounts in full,
      to the payment of all sums due to any party to the Servicing Agreement
      governing such Pledged Servicing which, by the terms of the applicable
      Acknowledgment Agreement, are subordinated in priority of payment to the
      amounts payable to the Agent and the Lenders, as described above; and

            SEVENTH, to the payment to the Borrower, or to its successors or
      assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any
      surplus then remaining from such proceeds.

      The Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of
any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. If the
proceeds of any such sale are insufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
such sale, as aforesaid, and the payment in full of the Obligations, the
Borrower shall remain liable for any deficiency.

      8.9 Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or
be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of
the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 9.1, and then only
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in
the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be
available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in
full.

      8.10 Actions Under Acknowledgement Agreements. If the Borrower elects to
include Pledged Servicing in Collateral, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
appointed the Agent as the Borrower's attorney-in-fact, effective as of the date
of any Default (and during the continuance thereof) for the purpose of taking
all actions on behalf of the Borrower contemplated or required under the terms
of the Acknowledgement Agreements with respect to such Pledged Servicing and
executing any instruments which the Agent may deem necessary or advisable to
accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment as attorney-in-fact is
irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Agent shall have the right and power to receive, endorse and
collect all checks made payable to the order of the Borrower representing any
payment on account of the principal of or interest on any of the Mortgage Loans
covered by such Pledged Servicing or on account of the terms of the Servicing
Agreements governing such Pledged Servicing and to give full discharge for the
same.

<PAGE>

      8.11 Transition from Prior Facility. The Pledge Date and all other
relevant delivery dates and time periods with respect to the determination of
Eligible Collateral shall be calculated to include any delivery dates or holding
periods prior to the Effective Date during which Collateral was being held by
the Collateral Agent (or was the subject of an Agreement to Pledge), had been
delivered to an Approved Investor or had been redelivered to the Borrower under
the Prior Facility.

to Section 2.10 (which may be accomplished solely by the Borrower, the Agent and
the subject Lender) and (b) temporary waivers of Collateral eligibility

consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into
agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any
provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the
Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any Default hereunder; provided,
however, that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each
Lender directly or indirectly affected thereby:

           (vii)  Permit the Borrower to assign its rights under this Agreement
                  or amend or waive any restriction on the Borrower's ability to

                  Documents.

           (viii) Amend or waive any Lending Sublimits or Borrowing Base

the Collateral Agent, as the case may be. In addition, the consent of the
Collateral Agent shall be required for the effectiveness of any amendment
referred to in Section 9.1 (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) and/or (ix) above. The Agent

Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive the making of the Loans
herein contemplated.

      9.3 Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the
Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

      9.4 Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for convenience
of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the
provisions of the Loan Documents.

      9.5 Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and
understanding among the Borrower, the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the
Lenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof,
other than the fee letter described in Section 2.5.3 and any other agreement
entered into in connection with the fees described in Section 2.5.

      9.6 Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of
its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any
right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that the parties
hereto expressly, agree that (i) the Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the
provisions of Sections 9.7, 9.8 and 10.11 to the extent specifically set forth
therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf
and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement
and (ii) the Collateral Agent shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of
Sections 9.1, 9.7 and 9.8 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall
have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf and in its own name
to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement.

the Arranger and the Collateral Agent for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the
Agent, the Arranger and the Collateral Agent) paid or incurred by the Agent, the
Arranger or the Collateral Agent in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery, syndication, review, amendment, modification,
and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower also agrees to reimburse
the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders for any
out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys
for the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders) paid or
incurred by the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in
connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents. Expenses
being reimbursed by the Borrower under this Section include, without limitation,
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the reports described
in the

                                       64
<PAGE>

following two sentences. The Borrower acknowledges that the Agent may prepare
and distribute to the Lenders annual audit reports (and shall distribute copies
to each Lender that requests a copy in writing of any such report actually
prepared by the Agent) pertaining to the Borrower's assets for internal use by
the Agent from information furnished to it by or on behalf of the Borrower,
after the Agent has exercised its rights of inspection pursuant to this
Agreement. The Borrower acknowledges that the Agent may, in certain
extraordinary circumstances, prepare and distribute other audit reports to the
Lenders (and shall distribute copies to each Lender that requests a copy in
writing of any report actually prepared by the Agent) pertaining to the
Borrower's assets for internal use by the Agent from information furnished to it
by or on behalf of the Borrower, after the Agent has exercised its rights of
inspection pursuant to this Agreement. The Borrower acknowledges that the
foregoing two sentences shall not limit the Agent's right to prepare additional
audit reports at its own expense from time to time.

            (ii) The Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify the Agent, the
Arranger, the Collateral Agent and each Lender, their respective affiliates, and
each of their directors, officers and employees against all losses, claims,
damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not
the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent, any Lender or any affiliate is a
party thereto) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby
or the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of
any Loan hereunder except to the extent that they have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification. The
obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.7 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

      9.8 Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower on the
one hand and the Lenders, the Agent and the Collateral Agent on the other hand
shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Agent, the Arranger,
the Collateral Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to
the Borrower. Neither the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent nor any
Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the
Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's business
or operations. The Borrower agrees that neither the Agent, the Arranger, the
Collateral Agent nor any Lender shall have liability to the Borrower (whether
sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Borrower in
connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions
contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act,
omission or event occurring in connection therewith, unless such losses resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which recovery
is sought. Neither the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent nor any Lender
shall have any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives,
releases and agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect or consequential
damages suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any
way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

      9.9 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that is
held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as
to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without
affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation,
enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to
this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.

      9.10 Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing documents, and
requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with sufficient counterparts
so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the Lenders.

                                       65
<PAGE>

      9.11 Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting
terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations
hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles,
except that any calculation or determination which is to be made on a
consolidated basis shall be made for the Borrower and all its Subsidiaries,
including those Subsidiaries, if any, which are unconsolidated on the Borrower's
audited financial statements.

      9.12 Confidentiality. The Agent and each of the Lenders agrees to maintain
the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that
Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors
(it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep
such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement,
(e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit,
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights
hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the
same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its
advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its
obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Agent or any Lender on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes
of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower
relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that
is available to the Agent or any Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received
from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified
at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

      EACH LENDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT INFORMATION AS DEFINED IN SECTION 9.12
FURNISHED TO IT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY INCLUDE MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC
INFORMATION CONCERNING THE BORROWER AND ITS RELATED PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE
SECURITIES, AND CONFIRMS THAT IT HAS DEVELOPED COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES REGARDING
THE USE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THAT IT WILL HANDLE SUCH MATERIAL
NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW,
INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

      ALL INFORMATION, INCLUDING REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS, FURNISHED
BY THE BORROWER OR THE AGENT PURSUANT TO, OR IN THE COURSE OF ADMINISTERING,
THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE SYNDICATE-LEVEL INFORMATION, WHICH MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL
NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE BORROWER AND ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE SECURITIES. ACCORDINGLY, EACH LENDER REPRESENTS TO THE BORROWER AND
THE AGENT THAT IT HAS IDENTIFIED IN ITS ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONNAIRE A CREDIT
CONTACT WHO MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION THAT MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC
INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW.

      9.13 Nonreliance. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying on
or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System) for the repayment of the Loans provided
for herein.

                                       66

      9.14 Disclosure. The Borrower and each Lender hereby (i) acknowledge and
agree that Bank One and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold investments
in, make other loans to or have other relationships with the Borrower and its
Affiliates, and (ii) waive any liability of Bank One or such Affiliate to the
Borrower or any Lender, respectively, arising out of or resulting from such
investments, loans or relationships other than liabilities arising out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Bank One or its Affiliates.

                       THE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

      10.1 Appointment; Nature of Relationship. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is
hereby appointed by each of the Lenders as its contractual representative
(herein referred to as the "Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan
Document, and each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the
contractual representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly
set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Agent is hereby authorized
to enter into the Security Agreement thereby appointing the Collateral Agent to
act on behalf of the Lenders and all obligations of the Lenders under the
Security Agreement shall be binding upon each Lender as if such Lender had
executed the Security Agreement. The Agent agrees to act as such contractual
representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article X.
Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent" throughout the Agreement, it
is expressly understood and agreed that the Agent shall have not have any
fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the representative of
the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders' contractual
representative, the Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any
of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within the meaning of
the term "secured party" as defined in the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code as
in effect from time to time and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor,
the rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to
assert no claim against the Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of
liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby
waives.

      10.2 Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the
Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each
thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by
the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

      10.3 General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or
any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder
or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, whether
sounding in tort, contract or otherwise except to the extent such action or
inaction arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

      10.4 No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent nor any
of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have
any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing
hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except

                                       67
<PAGE>

receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Agent; (iv) the
existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (v) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan
Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith;
(vi) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any
collateral security; or (vii) the financial condition of the Borrower or any
guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrower's or any such
guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose to
the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to
the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the
Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).

      10.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any
other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary
action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and
all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

      10.6 Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of its
duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders
and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

      10.7 Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

      10.8 Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by
the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in
connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute
between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the
enforcement

                                       68
<PAGE>

of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other documents,
provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent
any of the foregoing is found in, a final non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Agent. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8
shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

      10.9 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder unless
the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to
this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such
a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

      10.10 Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The Agent, in its
individual capacity, is not obligated to be or remain a Lender.

      10.11 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      10.12 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective
upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent has been
appointed, ninety days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its intention to
resign. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to
appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent; provided,
however, that such appointment, unless made during the continuance of a Default
or an Unmatured Default, shall be subject to the consent of the Borrower, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If no successor Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning
Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may
appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent; provided,
however, that such appointment, unless made during the continuance of a Default
or an Unmatured Default, shall be subject to the consent of the Borrower, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, the Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower or any
Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor
Agent hereunder. If the Agent has resigned and no successor Agent has been
appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the
Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable
Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. No
successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor
Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such successor

                                       69
<PAGE>

Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at
least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by
a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning
Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent, the resigning
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under
the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation of an Agent, the
provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

      10.13 Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrower and the Lenders agree that
the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be
entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.

      10.14 Collateral Releases. The Lenders hereby empower and authorize the
Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower on their behalf any agreements,
documents or instruments as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect any
releases of Collateral which shall be permitted by the terms hereof or of any
other Loan Document or which shall otherwise have been approved by the Required
Lenders (or, if required by the terms of Section 9.1, all of the Lenders) in
writing.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

      11.1 Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the
Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available), any amounts owed under Rate Management Transactions, and any other
Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or any Affiliate of any
Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and applied
toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the
Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due.

      11.2 Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has
payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any
other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of
the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will
hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender, whether in connection with
setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives
collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be
subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action
necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably
in proportion to their Loans. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal
process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made.

      11.3 Custodial Accounts. The Borrower agrees that funds received and held
by the Borrower as custodian for FNMA, GNMA or other mortgage pools which are
deposited into accounts with any Lender shall be clearly identified as custodial
accounts, and each Lender agrees that each provision of the foregoing
subsections of this Article XI shall not apply to such custodial accounts. The
Borrower shall not deposit any of its general funds in any custodial accounts or
otherwise commingle funds in any custodial accounts.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS; COMMITMENT INCREASES

      12.1 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents and (ii) and assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of
this Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit
assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, any
pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that
no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the
transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties
hereto have complied with the provisions of Section 12.3. The Agent may treat
the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for
all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3,
provided, however, that the Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be
required to) follow instructions from the Person which made any Loan or which
holds any Note to direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to another
Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loans or any Note agrees by acceptance
of such transfer or assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of
the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the
time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of
the Rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence
thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, or assignee
of the rights to such Loan.

      12.2 Participations.

            12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any
Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan
Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests
to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall
remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain
the owner of its Loans and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence
thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the
Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold
such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.

            12.2.2 Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment,
modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such
Participant has an interest which forgives principal, interest or fees or
reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan or
Commitment, extends the Termination Date, postpones any date fixed for any
regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees on, any such
Loan or Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or releases all or
substantially all of the Collateral (other than as expressly permitted pursuant
to the Loan Documents).

            12.2.3 Benefit of Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect
of its participating interest in amounts owing

                                       71
<PAGE>

under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan
Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided
in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to
each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each
Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees
to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its
right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if
each Participant were a Lender.

      12.3 Assignments.

            12.3.1 Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course
of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one
or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and
obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be substantially in
the form of Exhibit J hereto or in such other form as may be agreed to by the
parties thereto. The consent of the Borrower and the Agent shall be required
prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is
not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof, provided, however, that if a Default has
occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower shall not be required.
Such consents of the Agent and the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Each such assignment shall (unless it is to a Lender or an Affiliate
thereof or each of the Borrower and the Agent otherwise consents) be in an
amount not less than the lesser of (i) $10,000,000 or (ii) the remaining amount
of the assigning Lender's Commitment (calculated as at the date of such
assignment).

            12.3.2 Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of a
notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as Annex "I" to Exhibit
J hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consents required by
Section 12.3.1, and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing
such assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the effective date
specified in such Notice of Assignment. The Notice of Assignment shall contain a
representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration
used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable
assignment agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the
rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not
be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such
assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this
Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders
and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no
further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent shall be
required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the
Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser. Upon the consummation
of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor
Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall, if the transferor Lender or the
Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate
arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate replacement Notes are issued
to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes,
are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their
respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment. In addition,
within a reasonable time after the effective date of any assignment, the Agent
shall, and is hereby authorized and directed to, revise Schedule "1' reflecting
the revised commitments and percentages of each of the Lenders and shall
distribute such revised Schedule "1' to each of the Lenders and the Borrower,
whereupon such revised Schedule shall replace the old Schedule and become part
of this Agreement.

      12.4 Intentionally Omitted.

                                       72
<PAGE>

      12.5 Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to
disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation any information contained in any reports regarding the
Borrower; provided that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be
bound by Section 9.12 of this Agreement.

      12.6 Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to
any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with
the provisions of Section 3.4(e).

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                                     NOTICES

      13.1 Notices. Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.13 with respect
to borrowing notices, all notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, facsimile transmission
or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (x) in the case of the
Borrower, the Agent or any Lender, at its address or facsimile number set forth
on the signature pages hereof, (y) in the case of the Collateral Agent, at its
address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages of the Security
Agreement or (z) in the case of any party, at such other address or facsimile
number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the
Agent and the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.1.
Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given
by facsimile transmission., when transmitted to the facsimile number specified
in this Section and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail,
72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class
postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means,
when delivered at the address specified in this Section; provided that notices
to the Agent under Article 11 shall not be effective until received.

      13.2 Change of Address. The Borrower, the Agent, the Collateral Agent and
any Lender may each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice
in writing to the other parties hereto.

                                  ARTICLE XIV
                                  COUNTERPARTS

      This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which
taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may
execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This Agreement shall be
effective when it has been executed by the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
and each party has notified the Agent by facsimile transmission or telephone,
that it has taken such action.

                                   ARTICLE XV
          CHOICE OF LAW, CONSENT TO JURISDICTION, WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

      15.1 CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A
CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, BUT
GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

                                       73

      15.2 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO
THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR NEW YORK STATE
COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT
ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A
COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT
THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER
IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE BORROWER
AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER
INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED
TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN NEW
YORK, NEW YORK.

      15.3 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY
WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY
WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

                                     FORM OF
                          AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT

      This _____ Amendment to Credit Agreement ("Amendment") is made as of
____,______ by and among PULTE MORTGAGE LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the "Borrower"), ______ (the "Increasing Lender"), and JPMORGAN CHASE
BANK, N.A. ("Agent") as administrative agent.

                                    RECITALS

      A. The Borrower, the Agent and certain other lenders are parties to that
certain Sixth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of May
__, 2006 (as amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"). All capitalized
terms used in this Amendment and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Credit Agreement.

      B. The Borrower desires to amend the Credit Agreement to temporarily
increase the Aggregate Commitment and the Increasing Lender is willing to
provide the full amount of such temporary increase on the terms stated herein.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   AGREEMENTS

      1. Temporary Increase. As of the "Effective Date" (as defined below), the
Aggregate Commitment shall be increased from $_____ to $____ by an increase in
the Increasing Lender's Commitment from $____ to $____. Upon the Effective Date,
after giving effect to such increase, the Lenders' respective Commitment
Percentages shall be shown on revised Schedule "1" attached to this Amendment.
Such increase shall end on ____ (the "Reduction Date"). Upon the Reduction Date,
the Increasing Lender's Commitment shall be reduced by $____ to the amount in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Date. After giving effect to such
reduction and subject to any intervening changes in the Aggregate Commitment and
the Lenders' respective Commitment Percentages shall be returned to the
percentages in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date.

      2. Reduction Date Adjustment. On the Reduction Date the Borrower shall
repay the amount, if any, by which the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Loans exceeds the reduced Aggregate Commitment. The Agent shall
allocate such principal repayment among the Lenders so that each Lender's share
of all Loans as of the end of the business on the Reduction Date is equal to
such Lender's new Commitment Percentage after giving effect to such reduction in
the Aggregate Commitment.

      3. Effective Date. The "Effective Date" shall be deemed to have occurred
on the date that all of the following conditions have been fulfilled:

<PAGE>

      (i) this Amendment has been fully executed and delivered;

      (ii) if requested by the Increasing Lender, the Borrower has executed and
delivered to the Increasing Lender an amended and restated Note in the amount of
its increased Commitment; and

      (iii) the Borrower has paid any upfront fee due to the Increasing Lender
with respect to such increase in its Commitment.

      4. Miscellaneous.

      (i) The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that (i) after
giving effect to this Amendment, no Default or Unmatured Default exists, (ii)
the Credit Agreement is in full force and effect, and (iii) the Borrower has no
defenses or offsets to, or claims or counterclaims, relating to, its obligations
under the Credit Agreement.

      (ii) All of the obligations of the parties to the Credit Agreement, as
amended hereby, are hereby ratified and confirmed. All references in the Loan
Documents to the "Credit Agreement" henceforth shall be deemed to refer to the
Credit Agreement as amended by this Amendment.

      (iii) Nothing contained in this Amendment shall be construed to disturb,
discharge, cancel, impair or extinguish the indebtedness evidenced by the
existing Notes and secured by the Loan Documents or waive, release, impair, or
affect the liens arising under the Loan Documents or the validity or priority
thereof.

      (iv) In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of
the Loan Documents and the provisions of this Amendment, the provisions of this
Amendment shall govern. The provisions of this Amendment, the Credit Agreement,
the Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents are in full force and effect
except as amended herein and the Loan Documents as so amended are ratified and
confirmed hereby by the Borrower.

      (v) The Borrower agrees to reimburse the Agent and the Increasing Lender
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation and consummation of
this Amendment.

      (vi) This Amendment shall be effective as of the date that the Agent has
received executed counterparts of this Amendment from the Borrower and the
Increasing Lender.

      (vii) This Amendment may be executed in counterparts which, taken
together, shall constitute a single document.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed by their duly authorized officers, all as of the day and year
