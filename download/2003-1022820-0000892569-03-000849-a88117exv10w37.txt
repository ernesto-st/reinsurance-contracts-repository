               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONCERNING THE LOAN

      Borrower and, where appropriate, Guarantor hereby unconditionally
represent and warrant, as of the Closing Date to Lender as follows (which
representations and warranties have been and will be relied upon by Lender in
advancing Loan proceeds to Borrower):

      3.1 Formation and Existence. Each entity comprising the Borrower is duly
organized and validly existing in good standing under the applicable laws of the
state of their respective creation, and is qualified to do business in and is in
good standing in each state in which each Property is located, with full power,
right, authority and legal capacity to enter into this Agreement, the Mortgages,
the Loan and the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has the
authority to operate each Property as contemplated hereunder.

      3.2 Authority and Execution. The execution, delivery and performance of
the Loan Documents executed or delivered by each entity comprising the Borrower
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby: (i) have been
duly authorized by all requisite actions;

                                       11
<PAGE>

(ii) have been approved or consented to by all of their respective constituent
entities whose approval or consent is required to be obtained; (iii) do not
require the approval or consent of any governmental authority having
jurisdiction over any entity comprising the Borrower or any of the Properties;
(iv) do not and will not constitute a violation of, or default under, the
governing instruments of Borrower or any applicable requirement of a
governmental authority; and (v) will not be in contravention of any court or
administrative order or ruling applicable to Borrower or any of the Properties,
or any mortgage, indenture, agreement, commitment or instrument to which
Borrower is a party or by which it or its assets are bound, nor create or cause
to be created any mortgage, lien, encumbrance, or charge against the assets of
Borrower other than those permitted by the Loan Documents. Borrower further
represents and warrants that: (a) it has full power, authority and right to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations pursuant to the Mortgages, give,
grant, bargain, sell, alien, enfeoff, convey, confirm, warrant, pledge,
hypothecate and assign the Properties pursuant to the terms thereof and to keep
and observe all of the terms of the Mortgages on Borrower's part to be
performed; and (b) Borrower is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of
Section 1445(f)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the
related Treasury Department regulations, including temporary regulations.

      3.3 Fraudulent Transfer. Each Borrower (i) has not entered into the Loan
or any Loan Document with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any
creditor, and (ii) has received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its
obligations under the Loan Documents. Giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents, the fair saleable value of its assets
(including its rights to contribution pursuant to Section 4.12) exceeds and
will, immediately following the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents,
exceed its total liabilities, including subordinated, unliquidated, disputed or
contingent liabilities. The fair saleable value of its assets (including its
rights to contribution pursuant to Section 4.12) is and will, immediately
following the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, be greater than its
probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities
or its debts as such debts become absolute and matured. Its assets (including
its rights to contribution pursuant to Section 4.12) do not and, immediately
following the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, will not constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed
to be conducted. It does not intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur
debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments)
beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account the
timing and amounts to be payable on or in respect of its obligations).

      3.4 Pending Litigation and Proceedings. There are no actions, suits or
proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of Borrower threatened, nor any
pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower, threatened labor disputes, against or
affecting Borrower or the Properties, or any other collateral covered by the
Loan Documents, or involving the validity or enforceability of the Loan
Documents or the priority of the liens created or to be created thereby, at law
or in equity, or before or by any governmental authority, which, if adversely
determined, would, in the determination of Lender, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse affect on (i) the operation of the Properties
as contemplated hereunder, (ii) the ability of Borrower to pay

                                       12
<PAGE>

all of its liabilities or to perform all of its obligations in the manner and
within the time periods required under the Loan Documents, (iii) the validity,
enforceability or consummation of the Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby, or (iv) the title to the Properties, the permitted uses of
the Properties or the value of the security provided by the Loan Documents.

      3.5 Enforceable Obligations. This Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages and
the other Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party are the legal, valid and
binding obligations of Borrower subject, however, to applicable bankruptcy,
fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws or equitable principles now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting
the rights and remedies of secured creditors or other obligees in general, and
such obligations are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, nor would the operation
of any of the terms of this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages, and the other
Loan Documents, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render this Agreement
or the Mortgages unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject to any right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury.

      3.6 Permits. All certificates, permits, licenses (including all food,
liquor and other beverage licenses) and other authorizations of Governmental
Authorities which are necessary for the continued use and operation of the
Hotels in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Management Agreement
and the Loan Documents have been duly obtained by Portfolio, Jersey Owner or
Jersey Operator, as applicable, and shall remain in full force and effect, and
copies of the same have been or shall be furnished promptly to Lender when
obtained.

      3.7 Notice of Default. Borrower shall immediately notify Lender in writing
of (a) any condition that would constitute a Default Condition or an Event of
Default, (b) any litigation or proceeding that is brought against any entity
comprising the Borrower or the Property, and (c) any material adverse change in
the business, properties, or conditions (financial or otherwise) of any entity
comprising the Borrower or of Guarantor.

      3.8 Reappraisals. After the date hereof, Borrower shall permit Lender (and
Borrower hereby authorizes Lender) to commission, at Borrower's sole cost and
expense, one (1) new appraisal of each Property, prepared in accordance with
Lender's then current appraisal requirements. Borrower shall cooperate with any
additional appraisals commissioned by Lender at Lender's expense.

      3.9 Consent to Assignment. Upon Lender's request, Borrower shall obtain a
consent to assignment from each party to each material contract assigned to
Lender under the Mortgage and other Loan Documents, in form and substance
acceptable to Lender, evidencing such party's consent to the assignment of the
contract and agreeing that Lender shall have the right to enforce all rights of
Borrower under such contract.

unfavorable commitments which in each case are known to Borrower and which, in
Borrower's opinion, are reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect

reflected or provided for in the financial statements heretofore furnished to
Lender or as otherwise disclosed to Lender herein. Since the last date of such
financial statements, there has been no material adverse change in the financial

effect and there is no default, breach or violation existing thereunder by any

            (b) Notwithstanding any provisions set forth herein or in any other
document regarding Lender's approval of alterations of any of the Properties,
Borrower shall not alter any Property in any manner which would increase
Borrower's responsibilities for compliance with the applicable Access Laws

this Section against loss or damage by fire and against loss or damage by all
other risks and hazards covered by a standard extended coverage insurance policy

civil commotion, vandalism, malicious mischief, burglary and theft. The
insurance policy shall contain option perils and income loss endorsements and if

cost basis); (B) the then full replacement cost of the Hotels and the Personal
Property (as defined in the Mortgages), without deduction for physical

Lender a co-insurer under such policies. The deductible in respect of such
insurance shall not exceed the lesser of: (1) Ten Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($10,000.00); and (2) one percent (1%) of the face value of such policy, unless
a higher deductible is required by law. The premiums for the insurance carried

policy shall contain the "Replacement Cost Endorsement" with a waiver of
depreciation. In addition, there shall be no exclusion for terrorism or
terrorist acts in the insurance policies required by this Section.

            (b) Borrower shall also obtain and maintain during the entire term
of this Agreement and the Loan, at its sole cost and expense, for the mutual
benefit of Borrower and Lender, the following policies of insurance with respect
to each Property:

      currently or at any time in the future located in an area identified by
      the Federal Emergency Management Agency as an area having special flood
      hazards and in which flood insurance has been made available under the
      National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (and any amendment or successor act
      thereto) in an amount at least equal to the lesser of: (A) the outstanding
      principal amount of the Note; or (B) the maximum limit of coverage
      available with respect to the Hotels and the Personal Property under such
      act;

                  (ii) Comprehensive public liability insurance, including broad
      form property damage, blanket contractual and personal injuries (including
      death resulting therefrom) coverages and "Dram shop" or other liquor
      liability coverage if alcoholic beverages are sold from or may be consumed
      at any of the Properties, and containing minimum limits per occurrence of
      One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and Two Million and No/100
      Dollars ($2,000,000.00) general aggregate for the Land and the Hotels, or
      such greater amount as may be required under the Management Agreement or
      the Franchise Agreement; in addition, at least $5,000,000.00 excess and/or
      umbrella liability insurance shall be obtained and maintained for any and
      all claims, including all

                                       20
<PAGE>

      legal liability imposed upon Borrower and all court costs and attorneys'
      fee incurred in connection with the ownership, operation and maintenance
      of the Properties;

                  (iii) During the course of any construction of or repairs to
      any of the Hotels, builder's completed value risk insurance against "all
      risks of physical loss," (A) including collapse, water damage and transit
      coverage, in a nonreporting form, covering the total value of work
      performed or contracted for and equipment, supplies and materials
      furnished or contracted for, plus interest, costs and other "soft"
      construction costs as Lender reasonably deems appropriate and for which
      amount Lender shall notify Borrower in writing, and (B) including a full
      installation floater to insure all materials stored on the Land but not
      yet part of the permanent installation;

                  (iv) Business income insurance: (A) with loss payable to
      Lender, its successors and/or assigns, as their respective interests may
      appear; (B) covering all risks required to be covered by the insurance
      provided for in Section 4(a) in amounts not less than those specified on
      Schedule 1 attached hereto with respect to each Property; and (C)
      containing an extended period of indemnity endorsement which provides that
      after the physical loss to any Hotel and all personal property has been
      repaired, the continued loss of income will be insured until the Property
      is restored (or if such income is not as of the date of restoration at the
      same level it was at prior to the loss, then until six (6) months
      following the restoration date), or the expiration of twelve (12) months
      from the date of the loss, whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding
      that the policy may expire prior to the end of such period. The amount of
      such business income insurance shall be determined prior to the date
      hereof and at least once each year thereafter based on the provisions of
      this subsection. All insurance proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to this
      section shall be held by Lender and shall be applied to the obligations
      secured hereunder from time to time due and payable hereunder and under
      the Note; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed
      to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the obligations secured by
      the Mortgages on the respective dates of payment provided for in the Note
      except to the extent such amounts are actually and timely paid out of the
      proceeds of such business income insurance;

                  (v) Insurance, in an amount equal to the lesser of Two Million
      and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) per occurrence or the insurable value
      of the Hotels and the Personal Property, against loss or damage from
      leakage of sprinkler systems;

                  (vi) Worker's compensation insurance with respect to any
      employees of Borrower, as required by any governmental authority or legal
      requirement;

                  (vii) Motor vehicle liability coverage for all owned and
      non-owned vehicles, including rented and leased vehicles, containing
      minimum limits per occurrence of One Million and No/100 Dollars
      ($1,000,000.00) with minimum limits of Four Million

                                       21
<PAGE>

      and No/100 Dollars ($4,000,000.00) liability umbrella coverage or such
      greater amount as may be required under the Management Agreement or the
      Franchise Agreement;

                  (viii) Blanket crime and fidelity bond insurance coverage
      insuring against losses resulting from dishonest or fraudulent acts
      committed by Borrower's or Manager's personnel;

                  (ix) Earthquake insurance (including subsidence), if any of
      the Properties are located in an earthquake prone region, insuring the
      replacement cost with a maximum deductible of no greater than Twenty-Five
      Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($25,000.00) or ten percent (10%) of the face
      amount of such policy;

                  (x) If required by Lender, ordinance or law coverage to
      compensate for the cost of demolition and the increased cost of
      construction; and

                  (xi) Such other insurance as may from time to time be required
      by Lender or as may be reasonably required by the Management Agreement or
      the Franchise Agreement.

            The insurance coverage required under this section may be offered
under a blanket policy or policies covering all of the Properties and other
properties and assets not constituting a part of the security hereunder;
provided that any such blanket policy shall specify, except in the case of
public liability insurance, the portion of the total coverage of such policy
that is allocated to the Property.

            (c) Borrower shall increase the amount of insurance required to be
provided hereunder at the time that each such policy is renewed (but, in any
event not less frequently than once during each twelve (12) month period) by
using the Marshall and Swift Index to determine whether there has been an
increase in the replacement cost of the improvement since the most recent
adjustment of any such policy and, if there has been any such increase, the
amount of insurance required to be provided hereunder shall be adjusted
accordingly.

            (d) All policies of insurance required pursuant to this Section
(collectively, the "Policies"): (i) shall be issued by an insurer fully licensed
in the state where the Property is located with an investment grade rating for
claims paying ability of "AA" or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and
Standard & Poor's Rating Group, or such other rating in Lender's reasonable
discretion (or, if not rated investment grade by any of the foregoing, a cut
through endorsement from an acceptably rated company will be required); (ii)
shall contain a standard "noncontributory mortgagee" clause or endorsement and a
"lender's loss payable endorsement" or their equivalents and shall name Lender,
its successors and/or assigns, as their respective interests may appear, as an
additional insured and loss payee and as the person to which all payments made
by such insurance company shall be paid; (iii) shall contain a waiver of
subrogation against Lender; (iv) shall be maintained throughout the term of the
Mortgages without cost to Lender; (v) shall be assigned and delivered (either
originals or certified copies) to

                                       22
<PAGE>

Lender; (vi) shall contain such provisions as Lender deems reasonably necessary
or appropriate to protect its interest including, without limitation,
endorsements providing that neither Borrower, Lender nor any other party shall
be a co-insurer thereunder, that Lender shall have no liability for insurance
premiums thereunder and that Lender shall receive at least thirty (30) days
prior written notice of any modification, reduction or cancellation, including
any cancellation for non-payment of any premium; and (vii) be reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Lender, and be approved by Lender in its
reasonable discretion as to amounts, form, risk coverage, deductible, loss
payees and insureds. Borrower shall pay or cause Manager to pay the premiums for
the Policies (the "Insurance Premiums") as they become due and payable. Not
later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of each of the
Policies, Borrower will deliver to Lender satisfactory evidence of the renewal
of each Policy. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event
that the Management Agreement requires (1) greater amounts of coverage for any
insurance required hereunder, or (2) additional types of insurance coverage,
then the Management Agreement insurance requirements shall prevail. In the event
Borrower fails to provide, maintain, keep in force, or deliver and furnish to
Lender the Policies, Lender may procure such insurance or single-interest
insurance for such risks covering Lender's interest, and Borrower will reimburse
Lender for all premiums paid by Lender, together with interest thereon from the
date paid at the Default Rate, promptly upon demand by Lender. Until such
payment is made by Borrower, the amount of all such premiums, together with
interest thereon, shall be secured by the Mortgages.

            (e) After the occurrence of any casualty or damage in excess of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) to any Property, or any part thereof,
Borrower shall give prompt written notice thereof to Lender. All proceeds of
insurance from such casualty or damage to such Property in excess of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000) shall be payable to Lender to the extent of all Debt
then secured hereby, and Borrower hereby authorizes and directs any affected
insurance company to make payment of such proceeds in excess of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000) directly to Lender. Borrower shall have the right to
settle and adjust any claims, in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000) or less for loss, damage, or destruction under any Policy or Policies
of insurance, given final approval by Lender, not to be unreasonably withheld.
Lender is hereby authorized and empowered by Borrower to participate with
Borrower in the settlement, adjustment, or compromise of claims in excess of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), provided, however, that following the
occurrence and during a continuation of an Event of Default hereunder, Lender is
authorized and empowered to settle, adjust or compromise such claims without the
consent of, and on behalf of, Borrower. Lender shall have the option, in its
sole discretion, of applying all or part of the insurance proceeds resulting
from casualty or property damage (i) to the Debt secured hereby in such order as
Lender may determine, or (ii) to the repair and restoration of the Property upon
such terms and conditions as Lender may reasonably determine ("Restoration").
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to excuse Borrower from repairing or
maintaining the Property or from completing the Restoration of the Property,
regardless of whether or not the insurance proceeds are made available for such
purpose or whether or not any such proceeds are sufficient

                                       23
<PAGE>

for such purpose. The application by Lender of any insurance proceeds to the
Debt secured hereby shall not cure or waive any Event of Default under the
Mortgages.

            (f) Notwithstanding subparagraph (e) above, Lender agrees to make
available to Borrower any insurance proceeds it may receive on account of any
damage or destruction to any Property, provided Lender reasonably determines
that it is economically feasible to repair and restore the Property to its
previous condition prior to the maturity date of the Note and, provided further,
that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

                  (i) Borrower is not in default under any of the Loan Documents
      or the Management Agreement;

                  (ii) The total cost of repairing and restoring the Property to
      its condition immediately prior to such damage or destruction, as
      estimated by an architect approved by Lender, which approval shall not be
      unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall not be greater than
      the amount of such insurance proceeds together with any sums of cash that
      Borrower deposits with Lender in advance for the purpose of paying for the
      costs of such repairs and restoration; and

                  (iii) Borrower shall have provided Lender with evidence or
      additional security satisfactory to Lender, in Lender's sole discretion,
      demonstrating Borrower's ability to repay the Note.

            If Lender shall make said proceeds available to Borrower, such
proceeds shall be made available in the manner and under the conditions that
Lender may reasonably require, including, without limitation, (A) approval by
Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, of the plans and specifications for such work before such work is
commenced; (B) the making of progress payments to Borrower as the work
progresses; (C) the furnishing by Borrower of suitable completion or performance
bonds and builder's all risk insurance; and (D) written confirmation from the
Manager that the Management Agreement shall not be terminated as a result of
such casualty or during the course of such Restoration; further, no insurer
shall claim any rights of participation and/or assignment of rights with respect
to the indebtedness secured hereby. The Property and Improvements thereon shall
be repaired and restored so as to be of at least equal value and substantially
the same character as prior to such damage or destruction. If such proceeds are
made available by Lender to Borrower, any surplus which may remain out of said
insurance proceeds after payment of all costs and expenses of such repairs and
restoration shall, at the option of Lender, be applied on account of the Debt
secured hereby in such order as Lender may determine.

            (g) Borrower shall not carry separate insurance, concurrent in kind
or form or contributing in the event of loss, with any insurance required under
this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower may carry insurance not
required under the Mortgages, provided any

                                       24
<PAGE>

such insurance affecting the Property shall be for the mutual benefit of
Borrower and Lender, as their respective interests may appear, and shall be
subject to all other provisions of this Section.

            (h) In the event the Mortgages are foreclosed, or title to the
Property is transferred in extinguishment, in whole or in part, of the Debt
secured hereby, all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to all Policies
shall inure to the benefit of and pass to the successor in interest of Borrower
or the purchaser or grantee of the Property.

      4.4 Payment of Taxes. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments
(including, without limitation, all assessments imposed under any declaration of
covenants, owner's associations or special improvement districts affecting the
Property), water rates and sewer rents, now or hereafter levied, assessed or
imposed against the Property or any part thereof (collectively, the "Taxes") and
all ground rents, maintenance charges, other governmental impositions, and other
charges including, without limitation, vault charges and license fees for the
use of vaults, chutes and similar areas adjoining the Land, now or hereafter
levied, assessed or imposed against the Property or any part thereof
(collectively, the "Other Charges") as they become due and payable. Borrower
will deliver to Lender, at Lender's request, evidence satisfactory to Lender
that the Taxes and Other Charges have been so paid, or are not then delinquent,
no later than thirty (30) days following the date on which the Taxes and/or
Other Charges would otherwise be delinquent if not paid. Subject to the terms of
Section 4.19 below, Borrower shall not suffer, and shall promptly cause to be
paid and discharged, any lien or charge whatsoever which may be or become a lien
or charge against the Property, and shall promptly pay for all utility services
provided to the Property. Borrower shall be entitled to contest by appropriate
legal proceeding, promptly initiated and conducted in good faith and with due
diligence, the amount of any Taxes or Other Charges. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, during the pendency of any such contest Borrower shall pay
or cause to be paid all Taxes and Other Charges as and when due and payable, or
otherwise in accordance with Article 4.19 hereof.

      4.5 Escrow Fund. On the date hereof, Borrower shall make, or cause to be
made, an initial deposit to the Escrow Fund (hereinafter defined) in an amount
which, when added to the monthly amounts to be deposited as specified below,
will be sufficient in Lender's estimation, to satisfy the next due Taxes and
Other Charges and the next due Insurance Premiums. Borrower shall thereafter pay
to Lender on the first (1st) day of each calendar month for deposit into escrow,
sufficient funds (as estimated from time to time by Lender) to permit Lender to
pay the Taxes and Other Charges and the Insurance Premiums payable at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof (the foregoing amounts being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Fund and
the monthly installments of principal and interest payable under the Note shall
be added together and shall be paid as an aggregate sum by Borrower to Lender.
The Escrow Fund shall be held in an account in Lender's name, and Borrower
hereby pledges and grants to Lender a security interest in any and all monies
now or hereafter deposited in the Escrow Fund as additional security for the
payment of the Debt. Lender will apply the Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and
Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Sections 4.3 and
4.4 hereof. If the amount of the Escrow Fund

                                       25
<PAGE>

shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance Premiums and Other Charges
pursuant to Sections 4.3 and 4.4 hereof, Lender shall, in its discretion, return
any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to be made
to the Escrow Fund. If the Escrow Fund is not sufficient to pay the Taxes and
Other Charges and the Insurance Premiums when the same are due and payable,
Borrower shall promptly pay to Lender, within fifteen (15) days following
demand, an amount which Lender shall reasonably estimate as sufficient to make
up the deficiency. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may apply
any sums then comprising the Escrow Fund to the payment of the Debt in any order
in its sole discretion. Until expended or applied as above provided, any amounts
in the Escrow Fund shall constitute additional security for the Debt. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Escrow Fund shall not constitute a trust
fund and may be commingled with other monies held by Lender. No earnings or
interest on the Escrow Fund shall be payable to Borrower.

      4.6 Lockbox Agreement. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of that
certain Lockbox Agreement, all gross income derived from the operation of the
Properties shall be deposited directly into the Deposit Account. Absent the
existence and continuation of an Event of Default or the occurrence and
continuance of a Default Condition, the funds in such Deposit Account (i) shall
be made available to Borrower and its agents to pay approved operating expenses
for the Properties, debt service for the Loan, reserves and escrows, approved
capital expenditures for the Properties, and expenses incurred by Lender on
Borrower's behalf or in enforcement of Lender's rights under this Agreement or
the Loan Documents in accordance with the Budget approved by Lender, and (ii)
excess funds in the Deposit Account shall be promptly remitted to Borrower.
During the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender may apply sums on deposit
under the Lockbox Agreement against the Debt in such order as Lender deems
appropriate.

      4.7 Compliance with Laws. (a) Borrower shall promptly comply with all
existing and future federal, state and local laws, orders, ordinances,
governmental rules and regulations or court orders affecting the Property, or
the use thereof, including State laws, municipal ordinances, agreements with
governmental authorities and regulations affecting the Property's tax-exempt
status (if applicable), whether now or hereafter applicable to the Property
("Applicable Laws").

            (b) Borrower shall from time to time, upon Lender's reasonable
request, provide Lender with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the
Property complies with any Applicable Laws identified by Lender or is exempt
from compliance with such Applicable Laws.

            (c) Notwithstanding any provisions set forth herein or in any
document regarding Lender's approval of alterations of the Property, Borrower
shall not alter the Property in any manner which would materially increase
Borrower's responsibilities for compliance with Applicable Laws without the
prior written approval of Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Lender's approval of the plans,
specifications, or

                                       26
<PAGE>

working drawings for alterations of the Property shall create no responsibility
or liability on behalf of Lender for their completeness, design, sufficiency or
their compliance with Applicable Laws. The foregoing shall apply to tenant
improvements constructed by Borrower or by any of its tenants. Lender may
condition any such approval upon receipt of a certificate of compliance with
Applicable Laws from an independent architect, engineer, or other person
acceptable to Lender.

            (d) Borrower shall give prompt notice to Lender of the receipt by
Borrower of any written notice from any governmental agency, department or
instrumentality having jurisdiction over the applicable Property or Properties
related to a violation of any Applicable Laws and of the commencement of any
proceedings or investigations which relate to compliance with such Applicable
Laws.

            (e) After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own
expense, may contest by appropriate legal proceeding, promptly initiated and
conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the Applicable Laws affecting
the Property, provided that (i) no Event of Default which is not related to such
Applicable Laws has occurred and is continuing under the Note, the Mortgages or
any of the other Loan Documents; (ii) such proceeding shall be permitted under
and be conducted in accordance with the provisions of any other instrument to
which Borrower is subject and shall not constitute a default thereunder; (iii)
neither the Property nor any part thereof or interest therein nor any of the
tenants or occupants thereof shall be affected in any material adverse way as a
result of such proceeding; and (iv) Borrower shall have furnished to Lender all
other items reasonably requested by Lender.

      4.8 Condemnation. (a) Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice
of the actual or threatened commencement of any condemnation, governmental
taking or eminent domain proceeding of which Borrower has knowledge or receives
notice with respect thereto (a "Condemnation") and shall deliver to Lender
copies of any and all papers served in connection with such proceedings. Lender
is hereby irrevocably appointed as Borrower's attorney-in-fact, coupled with an
interest, with exclusive power to collect, receive and retain any award or
payment for such Condemnation and to make any compromise or settlement in
connection with such proceeding, subject to the provisions of this Agreement;
provided, however, that so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing hereunder or under the Loan Documents, Lender shall not be entitled
to exercise said appointment. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through eminent domain or otherwise (including, without
limitation, any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for in the Note, this Agreement, and the other Loan Documents,
and the Debt shall not be reduced until any award or payment therefor shall have
been actually received after expenses of collection and applied by Lender to the
discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the
award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the
award interest at the rate or rates provided in the Note.


                                       27
<PAGE>


            (b) All proceeds received by Lender in respect of any Condemnation
of all or part of the Property, or in respect of damage to all or any part of
the Property from governmental action not resulting in a taking of the Property,
shall be applied first to reimburse Lender for all costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with the collection of such
proceeds. The balance of such proceeds may be applied, at the option of Lender,
to the Debt secured hereby in such manner and order as Lender may determine, or
toward the Restoration of the Property, upon such conditions as Lender may
reasonably determine.

            (c) Notwithstanding subparagraph (b) above, Lender agrees to make
available to Borrower any Condemnation proceeds for the repair and restoration
of the Property, including without limitation, the purchase of such additional
adjoining property as may be necessary in order to comply with all Applicable
Laws, provided Lender reasonably determines, in its sole discretion, that it is
economically feasible to make such repair and restoration of the Property and,
provided further, that all the following conditions are satisfied:

                  (i) Borrower is not in default under any of the Loan Documents
      or the Management Agreement;

                  (ii) The total cost of repairing and restoring the Property to
      its condition immediately prior to such Condemnation, as estimated by an
      architect approved by Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably
      withheld, delayed or conditioned, shall not be greater than the amount of
      such condemnation proceeds together with any sums of cash that Borrower
      deposits with Lender in advance for the purpose of paying for the costs of
      such repairs and restoration; and

                  (iii) Borrower shall have provided Lender with evidence or
      additional security satisfactory to Lender, in Lender's sole discretion,
      demonstrating Borrower's ability to repay the Note.

            If Lender shall make said proceeds available to Borrower, such
proceeds shall be made available in the manner and under the conditions that
Lender may reasonably require, including, without limitation, (A) approval by
Lender of the plans and specifications for such work before such work is
commenced, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; (B) the making of progress payments to Borrower as the work
progresses; (C) the furnishing by Borrower of suitable completion or performance
bonds and builder's all risk insurance; and (D) written confirmation from the
Manager and the Franchisor that the Management Agreement and the Franchise
Agreement, respectively, shall not be terminated as a result of such
Condemnation or during the course of such restoration; further, no insurer shall
claim any rights of participation and/or assignment of rights with respect to
the indebtedness secured hereby. The Property and Improvements thereon shall be
repaired and restored so as to be of at least equal value and substantially the
same character as prior to such Condemnation. If such proceeds are made
available by Lender to Borrower, any surplus which

                                       28
<PAGE>

may remain out of said insurance proceeds after payment of all costs and
expenses of such repairs and restoration shall, at the option of Lender, be
applied on account of the Debt secured hereby in such order as Lender may
determine.

      4.9 Maintenance of the Properties. With respect to each Property: (a)
Borrower shall cause the Property to be maintained in a good and safe condition
and repair. The Improvements and the Personal Property shall not be removed,
demolished or materially altered (except for normal replacement of the Personal
Property) without the prior written consent of Lender. Borrower shall promptly
comply with all laws, orders and ordinances affecting the Property, or the use
thereof, subject to Borrower's right to contest the same as provided in this
Agreement. Borrower shall promptly repair, replace or rebuild any part of the
Property which may be destroyed by any casualty, or become damaged, worn or
dilapidated, or which may be affected by any proceeding of the character
referred to in Sections 4.3 and 4.8 hereof, and shall complete and pay for any
structure at any time in the process of construction or repair on the Land.
Except as expressly permitted in writing by Lender, Borrower shall not initiate,
join in, acquiesce in, or consent to any change in any private restrictive
covenant, zoning law or other public or private restriction limiting or defining
the uses which may be made of the Property or any part thereof. If under
applicable zoning provisions the use of all or any portion of the Property is or
shall become a nonconforming use, Borrower will not cause or permit such
nonconforming use to be discontinued or abandoned without the prior written
consent of Lender. Borrower shall not: (i) change the use of the Land as
currently configured and utilized; (ii) permit or suffer to occur any waste on
or to the Property or to any portion thereof; or (iii) take any steps whatsoever
to convert the Property, or any portion thereof, to a condominium or cooperative
form of ownership. Borrower shall not enter into any license, easement, covenant
or other agreement affecting the Property without the prior written consent of
Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

            (b) Borrower shall not commit or suffer any waste on or to the
Property or to any portion thereof or make any change in the use of the Property
which will in any way materially increase the risk of fire or other hazard
arising out of the operation of the Property, or take any steps to convert the
Property or any portion thereof to a condominium or cooperative form of
ownership, or take any action that might invalidate or give cause for
cancellation of any Policy, or do or permit to be done thereon anything that may
in any way impair the value of the Property or the security of the applicable
Mortgage. Borrower will not, without the prior written consent of Lender, permit
any drilling or exploration for or extraction, removal, or production of any
minerals from the surface or the subsurface of the Land, regardless of the depth
thereof or the method of mining or extraction thereof.

            (c) Borrower will promptly pay when due all bills and costs for
labor, materials, and specifically fabricated materials incurred in connection
with the Property and never permit to exist beyond the due date thereof in
respect of the Property or any part thereof any lien or security interest, even
though inferior to the liens and the security interests hereof, and in any event
never permit to be created or exist in respect of the Property or any part
thereof

                                       29
<PAGE>

any other or additional lien or security interest other than the liens or
security interests hereof, except as otherwise expressly permitted by Lender.

      4.10 Transfer or Encumbrance of the Properties; Breakage; Prepayment. With
respect to each Property: (a) Borrower acknowledges that Lender has examined and
relied on the creditworthiness and experience of Borrower and its managing
members and principals in owning and operating properties such as the Property
in agreeing to make the Loan, and that Lender will continue to rely on
Borrower's ownership of the Property as a means of maintaining the value of the
Property as security for repayment of the Debt. Borrower acknowledges that
Lender has a valid interest in maintaining the value of the Property so as to
ensure that, should Borrower default in the repayment of the Debt, Lender can
recover the Debt by a sale of the Property. Borrower shall not, without the
prior written consent of Lender, directly or indirectly, sell, convey, alienate,
mortgage, encumber, pledge or otherwise transfer the Property or any part
thereof, or permit the Property or any part thereof to be sold, conveyed,
alienated, mortgaged, encumbered, pledged or otherwise transferred
(collectively, a "Transfer").

            (b) A Transfer within the meaning of this Section and Agreement
shall be deemed to include: (i) an installment sales agreement wherein Borrower
agrees to sell any Property or any part thereof for a price to be paid in
installments; (ii) an agreement by Borrower leasing all or a substantial part of
any Property for other than actual occupancy by a transient hotel guest or space
tenant thereunder or a sale, assignment or other transfer of, or the grant of a
security interest in, Borrower's right, title and interest in and to any Leases
or any Profits; (iii) if Borrower, Guarantor, or any managing member of Borrower
is a corporation, without the prior written consent of Lender which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that the acquiring
Person has financial strength, assets and management which are not less than
that of Guarantor in Lender's sole discretion, the merger, consolidation or
voluntary or involuntary sale, exchange, conveyance or Transfer of such
corporation's stock (or the stock of any corporation directly or indirectly (at
any tier) controlling such corporation by operation of law or otherwise) or the
creation or issuance of new stock, in one or a series of transactions, in any
such case the result of which is that an aggregate of more than forty-nine
percent (49%) of such corporation's stock (or such controlling corporation's
stock) shall be vested, legally or beneficially, in a party or parties who are
not now stockholders, but which shall not include a sale, assignment or other
transfer of, or the grant of a security interest in, the Preferred Stock by
those Persons who are currently shareholders of such securities; (iv) if
Borrower, Guarantor or any general partner or managing member (or if no managing
member, any member) of Borrower is a limited or general partnership or joint
venture, (A) any merger or consolidation of such entity or of any entity
directly or indirectly (at any tier) controlling such entity, (B) the change,
removal or resignation of a general partner, managing partner or joint venturer,
the admission of a new general partner, managing partner or joint venturer, or
the direct or indirect (at any tier) transfer or pledge of the legal or
beneficial rights to the partnership interests of any general partner, managing
partner or joint venturer or any profits or proceeds related thereto, or (C) the
voluntary or involuntary merger, consolidation, sale, exchange, conveyance or
direct or indirect (at any tier) transfer of legal or beneficial rights to the
profits or other partnership interests in such

                                       30
<PAGE>

partnership or joint venture, or the creation or issuance of new partnership
interests, in one or a series of transactions, in any such case the result of
which is that an aggregate of more than forty-nine percent (49%) of such
entity's partnership or venturer interests shall be vested, legally or
beneficially, in a party or parties who are not now partners or venturers; and
(v) if Borrower, Guarantor or any general partner or member of Borrower or
Guarantor is a limited liability company, (A) any merger or consolidation of
such entity or of any entity directly or indirectly (at any tier) controlling
such entity (other than Guarantor); (B) the change, removal or resignation of a
managing member or of a non-member manager (or if no managing member or
non-member manager, any member), or the direct or indirect (at any tier)
transfer of the legal or beneficial ownership of membership interests or "units"
of a managing member or of a non-member manager (or if no managing member or
non-member manager, any member) or any profits or proceeds relating to such
membership interests or "units", or (C) the voluntary or involuntary sale,
exchange, conveyance or direct or indirect (at any tier) transfer of membership
interests or "units" in such limited liability company, or the creation or
issuance of new membership interests or "units" in one or a series of
transactions, in any such case the result of which is that an aggregate of more
than forty-nine percent (49%) of such company's membership interests or "units"
shall be vested, legally or beneficially, in a party or parties who are not now
members.

            (c) No Transfer of the Property, or of any interest therein, shall
be permitted during the term of the Loan without Lender's prior written approval
(except for leases in the ordinary course of business entered into in accordance
with the terms of the Mortgage). Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any
actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of default hereunder in
order to declare the Debt immediately due and payable upon Borrower's sale,
conveyance, alienation, mortgage, encumbrance, pledge or transfer of the
Property without Lender's consent. This provision shall apply to every sale,
conveyance, alienation, mortgage, encumbrance, pledge or transfer of the
Property regardless of whether voluntary or not, or whether or not Lender has
consented to any previous sale, conveyance, alienation, mortgage, encumbrance,
pledge or transfer of the Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else to the contrary in any Loan Document, Borrower may not sell, convey,
alienate, pledge or transfer any portion of any Property or prepay any portion
of the Loan prior to the expiration of the Lockout Period.

            (d) Borrower agrees to bear and shall pay or reimburse Lender on
demand for all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, Lender's
reasonable out-of-pocket attorney's fees and disbursements, title search costs
and title insurance endorsement premiums) incurred by Lender in connection with
the review, approval or disapproval, and documentation of any such Transfer.

            (e) The Loan may not be assumed, in whole or in part, by any entity
or individual, including any Affiliate of Borrower, during the Lockout Period,
after the Lockout Period or at any other time during the term of the Loan.
Lender's prior written consent, in its sole discretion, to a Transfer shall not
be deemed to be a waiver of Lender's right to require such

                                       31
<PAGE>

consent in the future. Any Transfer made in contravention of this Section shall
be null and void and of no force or effect.

            (f) (i) The Loan may not be prepaid, in whole or in part, prior to
      the expiration of the Lockout Period. Borrower explicitly acknowledges and
      agrees that, in consideration of Lender receiving the economic return it
      has bargained for and expects in connection with its reservation of funds
      hereunder, the Loan may not be prepaid in whole or in part until the
      expiration of the Lockout Period. If all or any part of the principal
      amount of the Note is prepaid upon acceleration of the Loan following the
      occurrence of an Event of Default during the Lockout Period or during the
      Prepayment Period (as hereinafter defined), then in addition to the
      payments otherwise required under the Note, Borrower shall be required to
      pay to Lender an amount (the "Breakage Fee") equal to (1) the present
      value of the Discount Amount (as hereinafter defined) as determined by
      Lender, discounted at a rate per annum equal to the most current Index (as
      defined in the Note) rate from the end of the Lockout Period to the date
      of such prepayment, plus (2) any and all losses, costs, fees and expenses
      of Lender, each to the extent that such losses, costs, fees and expenses
      are incurred or sustained directly or indirectly as a result of such
      prepayment of the Loan, including without limitation, any costs or
      expenses of Lender in cancelling or breaking any LIBOR contract or
      interest rate hedging agreement which Lender may have entered into in
      connection with this Loan. As used herein, "Discount Amount" shall mean an
      amount equal to the product of (x) the principal amount of such
      prepayment, (y) the Margin, and (z) a fraction, the numerator of which
      shall equal the actual number of days from and including the date of such
      prepayment to but excluding the final date of the Lockout Period, and the
      denominator of which is 360. The Breakage Fee to be paid in connection
      with any prepayment under this subsection (f) shall be determined in good
      faith by Lender and shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower (absent
      manifest error). For purposes of this Section 4.10, the amount of the Note
      (or the portion of the principal of the Note to be prepaid upon
      acceleration) on the date of prepayment shall be determined after giving
      effect to any payment of scheduled amortization made on such date.
      Notwithstanding anything in the Note or in any other Loan Document to the
      contrary, Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any Breakage Fee in the
      event of a prepayment during the Lockout Period or the Prepayment Period
      as a result of the application to the Debt of any insurance proceeds or
      condemnation proceeds pursuant to the terms of Sections 4.3 or 4.8 of this
      Agreement.

                  (ii) From and after the date which is the first (1st) day of
      the sixteenth (16th) month after the Closing Date, or August 1, 2003, up
      to and including that date which is twenty-one (21) months after the
      Closing Date, or January 31, 2004 (the "Prepayment Period"), Borrower may
      prepay the Loan in increments of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars
      ($100,000.00) (the "Prepayment"), subject to the satisfaction, in Lender's
      sole discretion, of all of the following conditions precedent:


                                       32
<PAGE>


                        (1) Borrower shall provide not less than forty-five (45)
            days prior written notice (the "Prepayment Notice") to Lender of its
            intention to prepay a portion of the Loan, the amount of the
            intended Prepayment and the date upon which such Prepayment shall be
            made (the "Prepayment Date").

                        (2) No Event of Default or Default Condition shall exist
            on the Prepayment Date or the date the Prepayment Notice is given.

                        (3) Borrower shall pay to Lender an amount equal to one
            percent (1%) of the Prepayment made to Lender simultaneously with
            the Prepayment.

                  (iii) From and after the date which is the first (1st) day
      after the end of the Prepayment Period, or February 1, 2004, the Loan may
      be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, together with accrued interest
      to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid, without
      penalty or premium, provided that if a prepayment is made otherwise than
      on a Monthly Payment Date and is not received by the Lender prior to 2:00
      p.m. EST, Maker shall pay interest on the amount prepaid through the next
      Business Day following the date of such prepayment. Any such prepayment
      shall be subject, in each case, to the satisfaction of the condition
      precedent that Maker shall provide not less than forty-five (45) days'
      prior written notice to Lender specifying the Monthly Payment Date (or, if
      applicable, any other date) on which such prepayment is to occur and
      indicating the principal amount of this Note to be so prepaid.

      4.11 Release of Property From the Lien of the Applicable Mortgage. (a)
During the Lockout Period, a release of one or more Property from the lien of
the applicable Mortgage and the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents,
whether in whole or in part, shall not be permitted. From and after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, any Property other than the Jersey Property,
may be released from the lien of the applicable Mortgage and the terms and
conditions of the Loan Documents (the "Partial Release"), subject to the
satisfaction, in Lender's sole discretion, of all of the following conditions
precedent:

                  (i) Borrower shall provide not less than thirty (30) days
      prior written notice to Lender of the Monthly Payment Date upon which
      Borrower intends to effect a Release hereunder (the "Partial Release
      Date") identifying the subject Property.

                  (ii) No Event of Default or Default Condition under any of the
      Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party shall exist on the Partial
      Release Date.

                  (iii) Borrower shall deposit with Lender for application to
      the Debt then outstanding a sum equal to one hundred and twenty-five
      percent (125%) of the Allocated Loan Amount with respect to such Property
      as reflected on SCHEDULE 1 hereto, plus accrued interest on the Allocated
      Loan Amount for such Property through the date of payment to the Lender
      (the "Release Price").


                                       33
<PAGE>


                  (iv) Borrower shall deliver a release of the applicable
      Property from the lien of the applicable Mortgage, Financing Statements
      and other applicable Loan Documents evidencing the lien against such
      Property (for execution by Lender), in forms appropriate for the
      jurisdiction in which such Property is located and acceptable to Lender
      and Lender's counsel.

                  (v) The Debt Service Coverage Ratio, as determined by Lender,
      for all Properties then remaining in the collateral pool securing the Loan
      shall be not less than 1.40 to 1.0, provided, however, if the Jersey
      Property would be the sole remaining Property securing the Loan subsequent
      to the proposed Partial Release, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the
      Jersey Property shall be not less than 1.60 to 1.0, as determined by
      Lender. Borrower shall be permitted, without payment of any prepayment
      fee, to prepay to Lender sums in excess of that which would otherwise be
      required hereunder, in order to achieve the required Debt Service Coverage
      Ratio required hereunder, in Lender's sole determination. As used herein,
      "Debt Service Coverage Ratio" means the ratio of (x) Net Operating Income
      to (y) Total Annual Debt Service. As used herein, "Net Operating Income"
      means as of any date of determination, the difference between the
      aggregate amount of all gross revenues derived and collected from the
      Properties for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date
      of such determination and the aggregate amount of all project operating
      expenses incurred or chargeable in connection with the Properties or
      allocable thereto during such twelve (12) month period, together with such
      adjustments thereto as Lender shall reasonably deem necessary in
      accordance with its then-current underwriting standards to reflect the
      actual net operating income of the Properties. As used herein, "Total
      Annual Debt Service" for the Loan means, as of any date of determination,
      the greater of (A) the then outstanding principal amount of the Loan
      Amount times a loan constant of ten and nine-tenths percent (10.9%), which
      is a numerical factor defined by the Interest Rate and the applicable
      amortization schedule (based on the current month's Interest Rate
      multiplied by twelve (12)) and (B) the actual Loan debt service paid
      during the twelve (12) consecutive months prior to the date of such
      determination.

                  (vi) Borrower shall have paid to Lender all accrued and unpaid
      principal, interest, the deferred financing fee on the portion of the Loan
      being prepaid and all other sums due under the Note, this Agreement and
      the other Loan Documents up to the Partial Release Date. In addition,
      Borrower shall pay on demand all costs and expenses (including reasonable
      attorneys' fees) incurred by Lender directly or indirectly in connection
      with the Partial Release, whether or not the Partial Release actually
      occurs. Without limitation of the foregoing, Borrower shall pay on demand
      any revenue, documentary stamp or intangible taxes or any other tax or
      charge due in connection with Partial Release.

            Upon compliance with all of the requirements and conditions
pertaining to the Partial Release set forth above, Lender shall release or cause
the release of the applicable

                                       34
<PAGE>

Property from the lien of the applicable Mortgage and the other Loan documents
in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.

      4.12 Security for the Loan; Cross-Collateralized Mortgages; Contribution
Rights. (a) Each entity comprising Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that
the Loan is secured by, among other things, Lender's mortgage lien on,
assignment of leases and rents from, and security interest in all of the
Properties. Such mortgage lien, assignment and security interest is evidenced
by, among other instruments, the Mortgages encumbering the Properties listed on
SCHEDULE 1 hereof. The Mortgages are cross-defaulted; they are also
cross-collateralized in that the Property described in each such mortgage serves
as collateral for the full amount of the Loan. In order to reduce Borrower's
expenditure for mortgage and recording taxes and for title insurance premiums,
and in order to establish certain partial release prices, Lender has agreed to
allocate the Loan among the various Properties, such amount being the Allocated
Loan Amount as to each Property as more specifically set forth in SCHEDULE 1
hereof. Notwithstanding such allocation made by Lender at Borrower's request,
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that each Property secures the full amount of
the Loan, and that, except for any releases of Properties made pursuant to
Section 4.11 above, no such Property shall be released from the lien of the
applicable Mortgage and other Loan Documents until satisfaction in full of all
amounts outstanding under the Loan, including fees and expenses due Lender.
Borrower shall not claim or assert that any Property is entitled to be released
from the lien of the mortgage or deed of trust applicable to such Property
regardless of whether the outstanding principal balance of the Loan has been
reduced by an amount that equals or exceeds the Allocated Loan Amount allocated
to such Property. Borrower acknowledges that following the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender may pursue its rights and
remedies, at Lender's option, against one Property, or against several
Properties or against all Properties without in any way exhausting or
restricting Lender's ability to subsequently, in one or more proceedings, pursue
other available remedies. Lender shall not be required to marshal assets.

            (b) Contribution. To provide for just and equitable contribution
among Borrowers, if any payment is made by a Borrower (a "Funding Borrower")
hereunder or under the Note or any other Loan Document in respect of the
Obligations, such Funding Borrower shall be entitled to a contribution from
other Borrowers for all payments, damages and expenses incurred by such Funding
Borrower under or in connection with such Obligations, such contributions to be
made in the manner and to the extent set forth below. Any amount payable as a
contribution under this Agreement shall be determined as of the date on which
the related payment is made by a Funding Borrower.

            (c) Calculation of Contributions. Each Borrower shall be liable for
contributions to each Funding Borrower in respect of all payments, damages and
expenses incurred by such Funding Borrower hereunder or under the Note or any
other Loan Document in an aggregate amount, subject to Section 4.12(d) hereof,
equal to (i) the ratio of (x) the fair market value, as of the Closing Date, of
the Property or Properties owned by such Borrower to (y) the fair market value,
as of the Closing Date, of the Properties owned by all Borrowers, multiplied

                                       35
<PAGE>

by (ii) the aggregate amount of such payments, damages and expenses incurred by
such Funding Borrower under or in connection with the Obligations.

            (d) Rights to Contribution Subordinated. Each Borrower agrees that
all of its rights to receive contribution under this Section 4.12 (whether for
payments, damages, expenses or otherwise) and all of its rights, if any, to be
subrogated to any of the rights of Lender shall be subordinated in right of
payment (in liquidation or otherwise) to the prior payment in full in cash of
all of the Obligations (whether for principal, interest, premium or otherwise).
If any amount shall at any time be paid to a Borrower on account of such rights
of contribution or subrogation, or in contravention of the provisions of this
Section 4.12(d) at any time, such amount shall be held in trust, segregated from
the other assets of such Borrower, for the benefit of the Lender and shall
promptly be paid to the Lender. The foregoing shall constitute a continuing
offer to, and agreement with, all persons that from time to time may become
holders of, or continue to hold, Obligations under this Agreement, and the
provisions of the foregoing sentence are made for the benefit of such holders
and such holders, as third-party beneficiaries hereunder, are entitled to
enforce such provisions.

      4.13 Estoppel Certificates: Affidavits. (a) Within ten (10) days after
request by Lender, Borrower shall furnish Lender or any proposed assignee of the
Loan with a statement, duly acknowledged and certified, setting forth: (i) the
amount of the original principal amount of the Note; (ii) the then outstanding
principal balance of the Note; (iii) the most recent rate of interest of the
Note of which Borrower has received notice; (iv) the terms of payment and
maturity date of the Note; (v) the date on which installments of interest and/or
principal were last paid; (vi) except as provided in such statement, there are
no defaults or events with which the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both would constitute an event of default under any of the Loan Documents to
which each Borrower is a party; (vii) any offsets or defenses to the payment of
the Debt to Borrower's knowledge; (viii) that the Note, this Agreement, the
Mortgages and the other Loan Documents to which each Borrower is a party are
valid, legal and binding obligations of such Borrower, which have not been
modified or if modified, giving particulars of such modification; (ix) all
Leases and other agreements necessary for the use and operation of the Property,
including without limitation, all food, liquor and other beverage licenses and
all other necessary permits and governmental approvals, are in full force and
effect, have not been modified, or if modified, setting forth all modifications,
and are not, to the knowledge of Borrower, in default or if any of such
agreements are in default, setting forth the specific nature of all such
defaults; (x) that the Management Agreement is in full force and effect, has not
been modified and is not, to the knowledge of Borrower, in default, or if in
default, setting forth the specific nature of such default; (xi) the Financial
Agreement is in full force and effect; and (xii) as to any other matters
reasonably requested by Lender and reasonably related to the Management
Agreement, the Leases, the obligations secured hereby, the Properties, this
Agreement or the Mortgages.

            (b) Within thirty (30) days after request by Lender which is made in
connection with a proposed sale, assignment, transfer or participation of the
Loan or during the

                                       36
<PAGE>

occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or Default Condition, each
Borrower shall furnish Lender or any proposed assignee of the Loan with a
certificate reaffirming all representations and warranties of such Borrower set
forth herein and in the other Loan Documents as of the date requested by Lender
or, to the extent of any changes to any such representations and warranties, so
stating such changes.

            (c) Borrower shall deliver to Lender upon request, an estoppel
certificate from the Manager attesting to such facts regarding the Management
Agreement as Lender may reasonably require, including, but not limited to,
attestations that such agreement is in full force and effect with no defaults
thereunder on the part of Manager or, to Manager's knowledge, any other party,
stating the amount of base management fees, incentive management fees and all
other fees and sums payable by Borrower under the Management Agreement, and that
the Manager claims no defense or offset against the full and timely performance
of its obligations under the Management Agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Lender; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be
required to deliver such certificates more frequently than once in any
consecutive twelve (12) month period except upon any sale or transfer (or
proposed sale or transfer) of the Loan by Lender or upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default or a Default Condition.

      4.14 Single Purpose Entity. Each entity comprising the Borrower hereby
represents and warrants, and covenants for so long as any obligations secured by
any Mortgage remain outstanding, as follows:

            (a) Borrower does not and will not own any asset or property other
than: (i) the Properties; and (ii) the Personal Property necessary for the
ownership or operation of the Properties for their intended purpose.

            (b) Each Borrower does not and will not engage in any business other
than the ownership, management and operation of its respective interest in the
Properties, and Borrower will conduct and operate its business in all material
respects as presently conducted and operated and will not change the use of the
Properties.

            (c) Other than the Indenture of Lease, the Management Agreement and
the Franchise Agreement, Borrower will not enter into any contract or agreement
with Guarantor or any Affiliate, except upon terms and conditions that are
substantially similar to those that would be available on an arms-length
third-party basis.

            (d) Borrower has not incurred and will not incur any indebtedness,
secured or unsecured, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent (including
guaranteeing any obligation), other than: (i) the Debt, and (ii) trade and
operational debt incurred in the ordinary course of business with trade
creditors and in amounts as are customary and reasonable under the
circumstances, and further subject to the provisions set forth in Section 4.22
hereof. Except with Lender's prior written approval in each instance, no
indebtedness other than the Debt is or shall

                                       37
<PAGE>

be secured by any Property. Lender's approval shall be granted or withheld at
Lender's sole discretion. In connection with any such financing approved by
Lender, Borrower shall be required to obtain and deliver to Lender a
subordination and standstill agreement from such lender which shall be in form
and substance satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion.

            (e) Borrower has not made and will not make any loans or advances to
any third party (including any constituent party, Guarantor or any Affiliate of
Borrower, of any constituent party or of Guarantor), except in de minimis
amounts in the ordinary course of business and of the character of trade or
operational expenses.

            (f) Borrower has done or caused to be done, and will do or cause to
be done, all things necessary to preserve its existence, and Borrower will not,
nor will Borrower permit any constituent party or Guarantor, to amend, modify or
otherwise change the partnership certificate, partnership agreement, articles of
incorporation and bylaws, trust or other organizational documents, as the case
may be, of Borrower or such constituent party or Guarantor in a manner which
would adversely affect the Borrower's existence as a single purpose entity.

            (g) Borrower will maintain books and records and bank accounts
separate from those of its Affiliates and any constituent party. The
requirements of the preceding sentence may, at the sole discretion of Lender, be
waived by Lender to the extent it has received from Borrower and has notified
Borrower in writing that Lender has accepted evidence, in the form of
dispositive judicial determinations, rating agency publications, legal opinions
or otherwise, that controlling court decisions no longer hold that the covenants
set forth in the preceding clause are material or significant elements in a
Borrower maintaining its "single purpose" nature and avoiding a potential
consolidation into the bankruptcy or reorganization of an affiliated entity.
Borrower shall not change the principal place of its business or the
jurisdiction of formation without the prior written consent of Lender.

            (h) Each of the entities comprising the Borrower is and will be, and
at all times will hold itself out to the public as, a legal entity separate and
distinct from any other entity (including any Affiliate or constituent party of

within ten (10) days of obtaining knowledge thereof; (b) Borrower shall
diligently and in good faith contest such Taxes, Other Charges or lien by

Borrower shall fail so to do, Lender may, but shall not be required to, pay or
cause to be discharged or bonded against) any such Taxes, Other Charges or claim
notwithstanding such contest, if in the reasonable opinion of Lender, the
Property or any part thereof or interest therein may be in danger of being sold,
forfeited, foreclosed, terminated, canceled or lost. Lender may pay over any

                          INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY

         As a condition to making the Loan, Lender requires and Borrower and
Guarantor have agreed to indemnify the Lender as set forth in the Environmental
Agreement and as follows:

         6.1 Hazardous Substances. Borrower hereby represents and warrants to
Lender, except as set forth in the Environmental Reports listed on SCHEDULE 7
attached hereto, that: (a) the Properties are not in direct or indirect
violation of any local, state, federal or other applicable governmental
authority, statute, ordinance, code, order, decree, law, rule or regulation

                                       49
<PAGE>
or common law pertaining to or imposing liability or standards of conduct
concerning the protection of human health, environmental regulation,
contamination or clean-up including, without limitation, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, and any state super-lien and
environmental clean-up statutes, including, but not limited to, those specific
state and local statutes, regulations and ordinances set forth in each Mortgage
with respect to the applicable Property (collectively, "Environmental Laws");
(b) the Properties are not subject to any private or governmental lien or
judicial or administrative notice or action relating to hazardous and/or toxic,
dangerous and/or regulated substances, solvents, wastes, materials, pollutants
or contaminants, petroleum, tremolite, anthlophylie or actinolite or
polychlorinated biphenyls (including, without limitation, any raw materials
which include hazardous constituents) and any other substances, materials or
solvents which are included under or regulated by Environmental Laws, including,
without limitation, Asbestos (collectively, "Hazardous Substances"); (c) no
Hazardous Substances are or have been, to the best of Borrower's knowledge,
prior to Borrower's acquisition of the Properties, discharged, generated,
treated, disposed of or stored on, incorporated in or removed or transported
from the Properties other than in compliance with all Environmental Laws; and
(d) no underground storage tanks exist on any of the Properties. So long as
Borrower owns or is in possession of the Properties, Borrower shall keep or
cause the Properties to be kept free from Hazardous Substances (other than de
minimis quantities of Hazardous Substances that are necessary and lawfully used
in the operation of the Property as a hotel or motel, and which are stored and
disposed of in compliance with all Environmental Laws) and in compliance with
all Environmental Laws, shall promptly notify Lender if Borrower shall become
aware of any Hazardous Substances on any of the Properties (other than de
minimis quantities of Hazardous Substances that are necessary and lawfully used
in the operation of the Property as a hotel or motel, and which are stored and
disposed of in compliance with all Environmental Laws) and/or if Borrower shall
become aware that any of the Properties is in direct or indirect violation of
any Environmental Laws and Borrower shall remove such Hazardous Substances
and/or cure such violations, as applicable, as required by law, promptly after
Borrower becomes aware of such Hazardous Substances or such violations, at
Borrower's sole expense. Nothing herein shall prevent Borrower from recovering
such expenses from any other party that may be liable for such removal or cure.
Upon Lender's request, at any time and from time to time while any Mortgage is
in effect (but in no event more frequently than once in any three-year period or
more frequently if specific facts and circumstances reasonably dictate, or
otherwise at Lender's election but at Lender's expense), Borrower shall provide
at Borrower's sole expense, an inspection or audit of each of the Properties
prepared by a licensed hydrogeologist or licensed environmental engineer
approved by Lender indicating the presence or absence of Hazardous Substances on
the Properties. If Borrower fails to provide such inspection or audit within
thirty (30) days after such request, Lender may order such inspection or audit,
and Borrower hereby grants to Lender and its employees and agents access to the
each of the Properties and a license to undertake such inspection or audit. The
cost of such inspection or audit shall be paid by Borrower and added to the
principal balance of the sums due under this Agreement, the Note and the
Mortgages and shall bear interest thereafter until paid at the Default Rate. The
obligations and liabilities of

                                       50
<PAGE>
Borrower under this Section shall survive any termination, satisfaction, or
assignment of any of the Mortgages and the exercise by Lender of any of its
rights or remedies thereunder including, without limitation, the acquisition of
any of the Properties by foreclosure or a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure.

         6.2 Asbestos. Borrower represents and warrants that no asbestos or any
substance containing asbestos (collectively, "Asbestos") is located on any of
the Properties. Borrower shall not install in any of the Properties, nor permit
to be installed in any of the Properties, Asbestos and shall remove any Asbestos
promptly upon discovery to the satisfaction of Lender, at Borrower's sole
expense. Upon Lender's reasonable request, at any time and from time to time
(but in no event more frequently than once in any three-year period or more
frequently if specific facts and circumstances reasonably dictate, or otherwise
at Lender's election but at Lender's expense), Borrower shall provide, at
Borrower's sole expense, an inspection or audit of any such Property prepared by
an engineering or consulting firm approved by Lender, indicating the presence or
absence of Asbestos on such Property. If Borrower fails to provide such
inspection or audit within thirty (30) days after such request, Lender may order
such inspection or audit. The cost of such inspection or audit shall be paid by
Borrower and added to the principal balance of the sums due under this
Agreement, the Note and the Mortgages, and shall bear interest thereafter until
paid at the Default Rate. The obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this
Section shall survive any termination, satisfaction, or assignment of any
Mortgage and the exercise by Lender of any of its rights or remedies thereunder,
including, but not limited to, the acquisition of any of the Property by
foreclosure or a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure.

         6.3 Environmental Monitoring. Borrower shall give prompt written notice
to Lender of: (a) any proceeding or written inquiry by any party with respect to
the presence of any Hazardous Substance on, under, from or about any of the
Property; (b) all claims made or threatened in writing by any third party
against Borrower or any Property relating to any loss or injury resulting from
any Hazardous Substance; and (c) Borrower's discovery of any occurrence or
condition on any real property adjoining or in the vicinity of any Property that
could reasonably cause such Property to be subject to any investigation or
cleanup pursuant to any Environmental Law. Borrower shall permit Lender to join
and participate, as a party if it so elects, in any legal proceedings or actions
initiated with respect to any of the Property in connection with any
Environmental Law or Hazardous Substance, and Borrower shall pay all reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred by Lender in connection therewith. In the event that
any environmental site assessment report prepared for any of the Property
recommends that an operations and maintenance plan be implemented for Asbestos
or any Hazardous Substance, Borrower shall cause such operations and maintenance
plan to be prepared and implemented at Borrower's expense upon request of Lender
and in accordance with the recommendation. In the event that any inspection,
assessment, investigation, site monitoring, containment, cleanup, removal,
restoration, corrective action or other work of any kind to prevent, cure or
mitigate any release, spill, emission, leaking, pumping, injection, deposit,
disposal, discharge, dispersal, leaching or migration into the indoor or outdoor
environment, including, without limitation, the movement of Hazardous Substances
through ambient air, soil, surface water, ground water,

                                       51
<PAGE>
wetlands, land or subsurface strata, or which is reasonably necessary or
desirable under an applicable Environmental Law ("Remedial Work") is recommended
by any such environmental site assessment report, Borrower shall, at its sole
cost and expense, commence and thereafter diligently prosecute to completion all
such Remedial Work within thirty (30) days after written demand by Lender for
performance thereof (or such shorter period of time as may be required under
applicable law).

         6.4 Indemnification; Recourse Liability. (a) In addition to any other
indemnifications provided herein, in the Environmental Agreement or in the other
Loan Documents, Borrower shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless the
Indemnified Parties (defined herein) from and against all liabilities,
obligations, claims, demands, damages, penalties, causes of action, losses,
fines, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses), imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Lender by
reason of: (i) ownership of any Mortgage, the Properties or any interest therein
or receipt of any Profits; (ii) any accident, injury to or death of persons or
loss of or damage to property occurring in, on or about any of the Properties or
any part thereof or on the adjoining sidewalks, curbs, adjacent property or
adjacent parking areas, streets or ways; (iii) any use, nonuse or condition in,
on or about any of the Properties or any part thereof or on adjoining sidewalks,
curbs, adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets or ways; (iv) any
failure on the part of Borrower or Guarantor to perform or comply with any of
the terms of any Mortgage; (v) performance of any labor or services or the
furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the Properties or
any part thereof; (vi) the presence, disposal, escape, seepage, leakage,
spillage, discharge, emission, release, or threatened release of any Hazardous
Substance or Asbestos on, from, or affecting any of the Properties; (vii) any
personal injury (including wrongful death) or property damage (real or personal)
arising out of or related to such Hazardous Substance or Asbestos; (viii) any
lawsuit brought or threatened, settlement reached, or government order relating
to such Hazardous Substance or Asbestos; (ix) any violation of the Environmental
Laws, which are based upon or in any way related to such Hazardous Substance or
Asbestos including, without limitation, the costs and expenses of any remedial
action, reasonable out-of-pocket attorney's and consultant's fees, investigation
and laboratory fees, court costs, and litigation expenses; (x) any failure of
any of the Properties to comply with any Access Laws; (xi) any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages or the other Loan
Documents being false or misleading in any respect as of the date such
representation or warranty was made; (xii) any claim by brokers, finders or
similar persons claiming to be entitled to a commission in connection with any
Lease or other transaction involving any of the Properties or any part thereof
under any legal requirement or any liability asserted against Lender with
respect thereto; (xiii) the claims of any lessee of all or any portion of the
Properties or any person acting through or under any lessee or otherwise arising
under or as a consequence of any Lease; and (xiv) claims of any persons arising
under or as a consequence of any of the Operating Agreements. Any amounts
payable to Lender by reason of the application of this Article shall be
immediately due and payable, shall be secured by the Mortgages and shall bear
interest at the Default Rate from the date loss or damage is sustained by Lender
until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be liable for any
losses

                                       52
<PAGE>
incurred by Lender arising solely as a direct result of Lender's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The obligations and liabilities of Borrower
under this Article shall survive any termination, satisfaction or assignment of
any of the Mortgages or the entry of a judgment of foreclosure, sale of any of
the Properties by nonjudicial foreclosure sale, or delivery of a conveyance in
lieu of foreclosure. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party or otherwise
be liable for any liabilities, obligations, claims, demands, damages, penalties,
causes of action, losses, fines, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) imposed upon, incurred by or asserted
against Lender by reason of any violation Borrower can establish to Lender's
reasonable satisfaction or in a court or other governmental proceeding results
from any Hazardous Substance or Asbestos being placed on, above or under any
Property from and after the date Lender forecloses on such Property or accepts a
deed in lieu of foreclosure with respect to such Property.

                  (b) "Indemnified Parties" means Lender and any person or
entity who is or will have been involved in the origination of this loan, any
person or entity who is or will have been involved in the servicing of this
loan, any person or entity in whose name the encumbrance created by any Mortgage

partial interest in this loan for the benefit of third parties) as well as the
respective directors, officers, shareholders, members, partners, employees,
agents, servants, representatives, contractors, subcontractors, affiliates,

this loan or the Property, whether during the term of this loan or as a part of
or following a foreclosure of this loan and including, but not limited to any
successors by merger, consolidation or acquisition of all or a substantial
portion of Lender's assets and business).

         6.5 Exculpation. (a) Subject to the qualifications set forth in this
Section, Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower to
perform and observe the obligations contained in this Agreement, the Note, the
Mortgages, the Assignment of Leases or the other Loan Documents by an action or
proceeding wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower, except
that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, an action for specific performance
or any other appropriate action or proceeding to enable Lender to enforce and
realize upon this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages, the Assignment of Leases
or the other Loan Documents, and the interests in the Properties and any other
collateral given to Lender pursuant to this Agreement, the Mortgages, the
Assignment of Leases and the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that,
except as specifically provided in this Article, any judgment in any such action
or proceeding shall be enforceable against Borrower only to the extent of
Borrower's interest in the Properties and in any other collateral given to
Lender. Lender, by accepting this Agreement, the Note, the Assignment of Leases,
the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, agrees that it shall not sue for,
seek or demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower in any such action

                                       53
<PAGE>
or proceeding, under, by reason of or in connection with this Agreement, the
Note, the Mortgages, the Assignment of Leases or the other Loan Documents. The

Guaranty Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (ii) impair the right of Lender
to name Borrower as a party defendant in any action or suit for foreclosure and

Agreement or the Guaranty Agreement or limit the liability of Borrower,
Guarantor or any other party thereunder.

                  (b) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right
which Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of
the Debt secured by the Mortgages or to require that all collateral shall
continue to secure all of the debt owing to Lender in accordance with the this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages, the Assignment of Leases, the Environmental
Agreement, the Guaranty Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article
or any other provision in the Loan Documents, each entity comprising the
Borrower and Guarantor shall be jointly and severally fully liable for and shall
indemnify Lender for any and all loss, cost, liability, judgment, claim, damage
or expense sustained, suffered or incurred by Lender (including, without
limitation, Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or attributable
or relating to:

                           (i) fraud or misrepresentation by Borrower or
         Guarantor in connection with the Loan;

                           (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of

<PAGE>
                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not
to pursue recourse liability as set forth in subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME

notice from Lender, Borrower shall continue to be in default under any term,
covenant, or condition of this Agreement, or any of the Loan Documents other
than as specified in any of the subsections of this Section; provided, however,
that if the cure of any such default cannot reasonably be effected within such

                             RIGHT TO CURE DEFAULTS.

         Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default or if Borrower fails to
make any payment or to do any act as herein provided, Lender may, but without
any obligation to do so and without notice to or demand on Borrower and without
releasing Borrower from any obligation hereunder, take such action as Lender may
deem necessary to protect its security for the Loan and the making of such
payment or doing of such act shall not waive or constitute an estoppel with
respect to any Event of Default then existing. Lender is authorized to enter
upon the Properties for such purposes or to appear in, defend, or bring any
action or proceeding to protect its interest in the Properties or to foreclose
the Mortgages or collect the Debt, and the cost and expense thereof (including
Lender's attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by law), with interest at the
Default Rate for the period after notice from Lender that such cost or expense
was incurred to the date of payment to Lender, shall constitute a portion of the
Debt, shall be secured by the Mortgages, and the other Loan Documents and shall
be due and payable to Lender upon demand.

                                   ARTICLE 9

                              RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

         9.1 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may,
at its election, but without any obligation to do so, without notice of any kind
to Borrower, do any one or more of the following:

                  (a) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default or if Borrower
fails to make any payment or to do any action as herein provided, Lender may
take such action, to the extent permitted by law, without any obligation to do
so and notice or demand, except for any notice which may not be waived pursuant
to applicable law or which is expressly provided for herein, or in any other
Loan Documents, and without releasing Borrower from any obligation hereunder, as
Lender deems advisable to protect and enforce its rights against Borrower and in
and to any of the Properties including, without limitation, the actions
described in each of the Mortgages and the following actions, each of which may
be pursued concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender
may determine, in its sole discretion, without impairing or otherwise affecting
the other rights and remedies of Lender:

                           (i) declare the entire Debt to be immediately due and
         payable;


                                       59
<PAGE>
                           (ii) if Jersey Operator shall remain in possession,
         deem Jersey Operator to be a tenant holding over and Jersey Operator
         shall forthwith deliver possession to the purchaser or purchasers at
         any sale or transfer of the Property pursuant to the exercise of
         Lender's remedies with respect thereto, or be summarily dispossessed
         according to provisions of law applicable. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, Lender may, at its option, allow the Indenture of Lease to
         remain in full force and effect, and Jersey Operator to remain as
         lessee thereunder;

                           (iii) institute judicial proceedings, by notice and
         advertisement or otherwise under a power of sale hereby granted to the
         extent required by law, for the complete foreclosure of one or more of
         the Mortgages in which case such Property or any interest therein may
         be sold for cash, upon credit or otherwise in one or more parcels or in
         several interests or portions and in any order or manner;

                           (iv) sell for cash, upon credit or otherwise any and
         all of the Properties or any part thereof and all estate, claim,
         demand, right, title and interest of Borrower therein and, to the
         extent permitted by applicable law, rights of redemption thereof,
         pursuant to the power of sale contained herein or otherwise, at one or
         more sales, as an entity or in parcels, at such time and place, upon
         such terms and after such notice thereof as may be required or
         permitted by law;

                           (v) institute an action, suit or proceeding in equity
         for the specific performance of any covenant, condition or agreement
         contained herein, in the Note or in the other Loan Documents;

                           (vi) recover judgment on the Note either before,
         during or after any proceedings for the enforcement of any Mortgage or
         the other Loan Documents;

                           (vii) apply for the appointment of a trustee,
         receiver, liquidator or conservator of any of the Properties, without
         notice and without regard for the adequacy of the security for the Debt
         and without regard for the solvency of Borrower, Guarantor or of any
         person, firm or other entity liable for the payment of the Debt, which
         appointment Borrower consents to by execution of this Agreement;

                           (viii) revoke the license granted to Borrower to
         collect the Profits and other sums due under the Leases and enforce
         Lender's interest in the Leases and Profits and enter into or upon any
         of the Properties, either personally or by its agents, nominees or
         attorneys and dispossess Borrower and its agents and servants
         therefrom, and thereupon Lender may to the maximum extent permitted, or
         not restricted, under applicable law: (A) use, operate, manage,
         control, insure, maintain, repair, restore and otherwise deal with all
         and every part of any of the Properties and conduct the business
         thereat; (B) complete any construction on any of Properties in such
         manner and form as Lender deems advisable; (C) make alterations,
         additions, renewals, replacements and

                                       60
<PAGE>
         improvements to or on any of the Properties; (D) exercise all rights
         and powers of Borrower with respect to the Properties, whether in the
         name of Borrower or otherwise including, without limitation, the right
         to make, cancel, enforce or modify Leases, obtain and evict tenants,
         and demand, sue for, collect and receive all Profits, earnings,
         revenues, and other income of the Property and every part thereof; and
         (E) apply the receipts from any of the Properties to the payment of the
         Debt, after deducting therefrom all expenses (including Lender's
         attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the aforesaid operations
         and all amounts necessary to pay the taxes, assessments insurance and
         other charges in connection with the Property, as well as just and
         reasonable compensation for the services of Lender, its counsel, agents
         and employees;

                           (ix) require Borrower to pay monthly in advance to
         Lender or any receiver appointed to collect the Profits, the fair and
         reasonable rental value for the use and occupancy of any portion of the
         Properties occupied by Borrower and require Borrower to vacate and
         surrender possession of any of the Properties to Lender or to such
         receiver and, in default thereof, evict Borrower by summary proceedings
         or otherwise;

                           (x) apply sums on deposit under the Lockbox Agreement
         against the Debt in such order as Lender deems appropriate; and

                           (xi) pursue such other rights and remedies as may be
         available at law or in equity or under the Uniform Commercial Code.

                  In the event of a sale, by foreclosure or otherwise, of less
than all of any Property or the Properties, the Mortgages shall continue as a
lien on the remaining portion of such Property or the Properties.

                  (b) The proceeds of any sale made under or by virtue of this
Section, together with any other sums which then may be held by Lender under
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, whether under the provisions of this
Section or otherwise, shall be applied by Lender to the payment of the Debt in
such priority and proportion as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper.

                  (c) Lender may adjourn from time to time any sale by it to be
made under or by virtue of any Mortgage by announcement at the time and place
appointed for such sale or for such adjourned sale or sales; and, except as
otherwise provided by any applicable provision of law, Lender, without further
notice or publication, may make such sale at the time and place to which such
sale shall be so adjourned.

                  (d) Upon the completion of any sale or sales pursuant hereto,
Lender or an officer of any court empowered to do so, shall execute and deliver
to the accepted purchaser or purchasers a good and sufficient instrument, or
good and sufficient instruments, conveying, assigning and transferring all
estate, right, title and interest in and to the property and rights sold. Any
sale or sales made under or by virtue of this Section, whether made under the
power of sale

                                       61
<PAGE>
herein granted or under or by virtue of judicial proceedings or of a judgment or
decree of foreclosure and sale, shall operate to divest all the estate, right,
title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever, whether at law or in equity, of
Borrower in and to the properties and rights so sold, and shall be a perpetual
bar both at law and in equity against Borrower and against any and all persons
claiming or who may claim the same, or any part thereof from, through or under
Borrower.

                  (e) Upon any sale made under or by virtue of this Section,
whether made under the power of sale herein granted or under or by virtue of
judicial proceedings or of a judgment or decree of foreclosure and sale, Lender
may bid for and acquire any of the Properties or any part thereof and in lieu of
paying cash therefor may make settlement for the purchase price by crediting
upon the Debt the net sales price after deducting therefrom the expenses of the
sale and costs of the action and any other sums which Lender is authorized to
deduct under this Agreement.

                  (f) No recovery of any judgment by Lender and no levy of an
execution under any judgment upon the Property or the Properties or upon any
other property of Borrower shall affect in any manner or to any extent the lien
of any Mortgage upon any Property or any part thereof, or any liens, rights,
powers or remedies of Lender hereunder, but such liens, rights, powers and
remedies of Lender shall continue unimpaired as before.

                  (g) Lender may terminate or rescind any proceeding or other
action brought in connection with its exercise of the remedies provided in this
Section at any time before the conclusion thereof, as determined in Lender's
sole discretion and without prejudice to Lender.

                  (h) Lender may resort for the payment of the Debt to any
remedies and the security given by this Agreement, the Note, any Mortgage or the
other Loan Documents in whole or in part, and in such portions and in such order
as determined by Lender's sole discretion. No such action shall in any way be
considered a waiver of any rights, benefits or remedies evidenced or provided by
this Agreement, the Note, any Mortgage or the other Loan Documents. The failure
of Lender to exercise any right, remedy or option provided in this Agreement,
the Note, any Mortgage or the other Loan Documents shall not be deemed a waiver
of such right, remedy or option or of any covenant or obligation secured by this
Agreement, the Note, any Mortgage or the other Loan Documents. No acceptance by
Lender of any payment after the occurrence of any Event of Default and no
payment by Lender of any obligation for which Borrower is liable hereunder shall
be deemed to waive or cure any Event of Default with respect to Borrower, or
Borrower's liability to pay such obligation. No sale of all or any portion of
the Property, no forbearance on the part of Lender, and no extension of time for
the payment of the whole or any portion of the Debt or any other indulgence
given by Lender to Borrower, shall operate to release or in any manner affect
the interest of Lender in the remaining Property or Properties or the liability
of Borrower to pay the Debt. No waiver by Lender shall be effective unless it is
in writing and then only to the extent specifically stated.


                                       62
<PAGE>
                  (i) Lender shall not be under any obligation to marshal any
assets in favor of any Person or against or in payment of any or all of the
Debt. To the extent that any Person makes a payment or payments to Lender, or
Lender enforces its remedies or exercises its rights of setoff, and such payment
or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party
under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause,
then to the extent of such recovery, the Debt or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied, and all liens, if any, rights and remedies therefor,
shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had
not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

                  (j) The interests and rights of Lender under this Agreement,
the Note, the Mortgages or the other Loan Documents shall not be impaired by any
indulgence, including: (i) any renewal, extension or modification which Lender
may grant with respect to any of the Debt; (ii) any surrender, compromise,
release, renewal, extension, exchange or substitution which Lender may grant
with respect to any of the Properties or any portion thereof; or (iii) any
release or indulgence granted to any maker, endorser, guarantor or surety of any
of the Debt.

                  (k) Borrower hereby expressly waives and releases to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the pleading of any statute of limitations as a
defense to payment of the Debt or performance of its obligations under any of
the Loan Documents.

         9.2 Sums Expended by Lender. Any sums expended by the Lender pursuant
to the provisions of this Article shall become part of the Debt, shall bear
interest from date of disbursement at the default rate provided in the Note,
shall be payable upon demand and shall be secured by the Mortgages even though
such sums, when added to previous advances to Borrower, shall exceed the face
amount of the Note.

         9.3 Actions and Proceedings. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Lender has the right to appear in and defend
any action or proceeding brought with respect to the Properties and to bring any
action or proceeding, in the name and on behalf of Borrower, which Lender, in
its discretion, decides should be brought to protect its interest in the
Properties. Lender shall, at its option, be subrogated to the lien of any
mortgage or other security instrument discharged in whole or in part by the
Debt, and any such subrogation rights shall constitute additional security for
the payment of the Debt.

         9.4 Recovery of Sums Required to Be Paid. Lender shall have the right
from time to time to take action to recover any sum or sums which constitute a
part of the Debt as they become due, without regard to whether or not the
balance of the Debt shall be due, and without prejudice to the right of Lender
thereafter to bring an action of foreclosure, or any other action, for a default
or defaults by Borrower existing at the time such earlier action was commenced.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1 Notices. Any notice, demand, statement, request, consent or other

courier and designated for next Business Day delivery, (b) upon delivery, if
delivered in person or by facsimile transmission with receipt acknowledged by
the recipient thereof, or (c) on the third (3rd) Business Day following the day
such notice is deposited with the United States postal service first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the address, as set forth
above, of the party to whom such notice is to be given, or to such other address
or additional party as Borrower or Lender, as the case may be, shall in like
manner designate in writing. Any notice to Lender shall be likewise given to (i)
Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman, 1025 Thomas Jefferson Street, N.W., Suite 700 East
Tower, Washington, D.C. 20007, to the attention of Christopher J. Hart, Esq.,
and any notice to Borrower shall be likewise given to (ii) Latham & Watkins,
Sears Tower, Suite 5800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, to the attention of Kenneth D.
Crews, Esq.

         10.2 Savings Clause. If any one or more of the provisions contained in
any Loan Document shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
contained in any Loan Document shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby, and such Loan Document shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

         10.3 Waiver of Notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
neither Borrower nor Guarantor shall be entitled to any notices of any nature
whatsoever from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement
or the Loan Documents specifically and expressly provides for the giving of
notice by Lender to Borrower or Guarantor and except with respect to matters for
which Lender is required by applicable law to give notice, and Borrower and
Guarantor each hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the Loan Documents
does not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by Lender
to Borrower or Guarantor, including, without limitation, notice of default,
notice of intention to accelerate sums under the Loan Documents and notice of
acceleration of sums under the Loan Documents. All notices required hereunder
must be sent in the manner set forth above.

         10.4 Remedies of Borrower. In the event that a claim or adjudication is
made that Lender has acted unreasonably or has unreasonably delayed acting in
any case where by law or under this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages, the
Assignment of Contracts, the Environmental Agreement, the Guaranty Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, it has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Lender shall not be liable for any monetary damages, and Borrower's and
Guarantor's remedies shall be limited to injunctive relief or declaratory
judgment.


                                       64
<PAGE>
         10.5 Non-Waiver. The failure of Lender to insist upon strict
performance of any term hereof shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any term of
this Agreement or the Mortgages. Borrower shall not be relieved of Borrower's
obligations hereunder or thereunder by reason of: (a) the failure of Lender to
comply with any request of Borrower or Guarantor to take any action to foreclose
any Mortgage or otherwise to enforce any of the provisions hereof or of the
Note, the Assignment of Contracts, the Environmental Agreement, the Guaranty
Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (b) the release, regardless of
consideration, of the whole or any part of the Property, or of any person liable
for the Debt or any portion thereof; or (c) any agreement or stipulation by
Lender extending the time of payment or otherwise modifying or supplementing the
terms of this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages, the Assignment of Contracts,
the Environmental Agreement, the Guaranty Agreement or the other Loan Documents.
Lender may resort for the payment of the Debt to any other security held by
Lender in such order and manner as Lender, in its discretion, may elect. Lender
may take action to recover the Debt, or any portion thereof, or to enforce any
covenant hereof without prejudice to the rights of Lender thereafter to
foreclosure the Mortgages. The rights and remedies of Lender under this
Agreement and the Mortgages shall be separate, distinct and cumulative and none
shall be given effect to the exclusion of the others. No act of Lender shall be
construed as an election to proceed under any one provision herein to the
exclusion of any other provision. Lender shall not be limited exclusively to the
rights and remedies herein stated but shall be entitled to every right and
remedy now or hereafter afforded at law or in equity.

         10.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries. The terms, provisions, conditions
and requirements made and set forth herein are for the benefit of the parties
hereto and to better define the terms of the Loan, and in no event shall Lender
be construed to be Borrower's agent, and in no event is Lender assuming
Borrower's responsibility for proper payment to any contractor or others. It is
specifically further intended that no party shall be a third party beneficiary
hereunder except and unless it is specifically provided herein that any
provision shall operate or inure to the use and benefit of a third party.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no contractor, subcontractor,
material supplier, franchisor or manager shall have any rights hereunder against
Lender, or be entitled to protection of any of the covenants herein contained,
although such parties may have recourse to the Borrower.

         10.7 Joint and Several. If Borrower or Guarantor consists of more than
one person, the obligations and liabilities of each such person hereunder and of
each of Borrower and Guarantor shall be joint and several. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the parties constituting Borrower be required to
make duplicative deliveries of any payments, certificates or other documents
required hereunder. Subject to the provisions hereof requiring Lender's consent
to any transfer of any Property, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of Borrower, Guarantor and Lender and their respective successors
and assigns forever.

         10.8 Indemnity. Borrower does hereby agree to indemnify and hold
harmless Lender, its directors, officers, employees, agents and parent and
subsidiary corporations, and each of them in accordance with the terms and
provisions of Article 6 hereof.

identified in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Section shall affect
the Lender's right to serve process in any manner permitted by law, or limit
Lender's right to bring proceedings against Borrower or Guarantor in the courts
of any other jurisdiction.

         10.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. BORROWER AND LENDER HEREBY AGREE NOT TO
ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE NOTE, THIS AGREEMENT, THE MORTGAGES OR THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION
THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER AND LENDER, AND IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY
EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD
OTHERWISE ACCRUE. BORROWER AND LENDER ARE HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF
THIS SECTION IN ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY BORROWER
OR LENDER, AS APPLICABLE.

         10.12 Waiver. Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under the Note, the
Mortgages or any other Loan

                                       66


<PAGE>
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege.

         10.13 No Oral Modifications. No modification, amendment or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or any other Loan
Document, nor consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Lender, and then
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on Borrower in any case
shall entitle Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in the same,
similar or other circumstances.

         10.14 Brokerage. Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that
Borrower has not dealt with any person, firm or corporation who is or may be
entitled to any finder's fee, brokerage commission, loan commission or other sum
in connection with the execution of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the making of the Loan by Lender to
Borrower, and Borrower does hereby indemnify and agree to hold Lender harmless
from and against any and all loss, liability or expense, including court costs
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, which Lender may suffer or sustain
should such warranty or representation prove inaccurate in whole or in part.

         10.15 Assignment. The terms hereof shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors,
assigns and personal representatives; provided, however, that Borrower shall not
assign this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, duties or obligations
hereunder or any Loan proceeds or other monies to be disbursed hereunder in
whole or in part without the prior written consent of Lender, and any such
assignment (whether voluntary or by operation of law) without said consent shall
be void. Borrower expressly recognizes and agrees that Lender may (a) fund the
Loan through an affiliate, (b) sell or transfer interests in the Loan and the
Loan Documents related thereto to one or more participants or special purpose
entities, (c) pledge Lender's interests in the Loan and the Loan Documents as
security for one or more loans obtained by Lender or (d) sell or transfer
Lender's interests in the Loan and the Loan Documents in connection with a
securitization transaction, and that all documentation, financial statements,
appraisals, reports and other data, or copies thereof, related to the Borrower,
the principals of Borrower, any Guarantor, the Property or the Loan may be
exhibited to and retained by any party that is reviewing the Loan for the
purposes of purchasing, valuing or rating, provided that such reviewing party
shall agree to keep such information strictly confidential to itself and its
advisors. In the event of any assignment or transfer of all of Lender's ongoing
interests in the Loan and Loan Documents following disbursement of all sums set
forth in the Budget, Lender shall thereafter be relieved of all liability
hereunder and any Loan disbursements made by any assignee shall be deemed made
in pursuance and not in modification hereof and shall be evidenced by the Note
and secured by the Mortgage and any other Loan Documents.


                                       67

         10.16 Further Assurances. (a) Borrower will, at the cost of Borrower,
and without expense to Lender, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and
every such further acts, deeds, conveyances, mortgages, assignments, notices of
assignment, Uniform Commercial Code financing statements or continuation
statements, transfers and assurances as Lender shall, from time to time,
reasonably require, for the better assuring, conveying, assigning, transferring,
perfecting and confirming unto Lender the property and rights hereby, or in any
Mortgage, given, mortgaged, granted, bargained, sold, alienated, enfeoffed,
conveyed, confirmed, pledged, assigned and hypothecated or intended now or
hereafter so to be, or which Borrower may be or may hereafter become bound to
convey or assign to Lender, or for carrying out the intention or facilitating
the performance of the terms of this Agreement, the Mortgages or for filing,
registering or recording the Mortgages. Borrower, on demand, will execute and
deliver and hereby authorizes Lender to execute in the name of Borrower or
without the signature of Borrower to the extent Lender may lawfully do so, one
or more financing statements, chattel mortgages or other instruments, to
evidence more effectively the security interest of Lender in the Properties.
Borrower grants to Lender an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an
interest for the purpose of exercising and perfecting any and all rights and
remedies available to Lender at law and in equity, including, without
limitation, such rights and remedies available to Lender pursuant to this
Section.

                  (b) Borrower acknowledges that Lender may (i) sell or transfer
interests in the Loan and Loan Documents to one or more participants or special
purpose entities, (ii) pledge Lender's interests in the Loan and the Loan
Documents as security for one or more loans obtained by Lender, or (iii) sell
the Loan evidenced by the Note and the Loan Documents to a party who may pool
the Loan with a number of other loans and to have the holder of such loans grant
participations therein or issue one or more classes of Mortgage-Backed,
Pass-Through Certificates or other securities evidencing a beneficial interest
in a rated or unrated public offering or private placement (the "Securities").
The Securities may be rated by one or more national rating agencies. Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that Lender may, at any time, sell, transfer or assign
this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, and any or
all servicing rights with respect thereto, or grant participation therein or
issue Securities evidencing a beneficial interest in a rated or unrated public
offering or private placement. In this regard, Borrower agrees to make available
to Lender all information concerning its business and operations which Lender
reasonably requests. Lender may share such information with the investment
banking firms, rating agencies, accounting firms, law firms and other
third-party advisory firms involved with the Loan or the Securities; provided,
however, that Lender shall take such reasonable steps to obtain from any such
reviewing party assurances it will keep such information strictly confidential
to itself and its advisors and review such information in confidence. Lender may
forward to each purchaser, transferee, assignee, servicer, participant or
investor in such securities or any credit rating agency rating such Securities
(collectively, the "Investor") and each prospective Investor, all documents and
information which Lender now has or may hereafter acquire relating to Borrower
and the Property, whether furnished by Borrower or otherwise, as Lender
determines necessary or desirable consistent with full disclosure for purposes
of marketing and underwriting the Loan; provided, however, that Lender shall
take

                                       68
<PAGE>
such reasonable steps to obtain from any such reviewing party assurances it will
keep such information strictly confidential to itself and its advisors and
review such information in confidence. Borrower shall furnish and hereby
consents to Lender furnishing to such Investor or such prospective Investor any
and all information concerning Borrower and the Properties as may be reasonably
requested by Lender, any Investor or any prospective Investor in connection with
any sale, transfer or participation interest, provided that Lender shall
promptly reimburse Borrower any material costs and expense incurred by Borrower
in connection therewith. It is understood that the information provided by
Borrower to Lender may ultimately be incorporated into the offering documents
for the Securities and thus such information may be disclosed to Investor and
prospective Investor. Lender and all of the aforesaid third-party advisors and
professional firms shall be entitled to rely on the information supplied by, or
on behalf of, Borrower. Upon any transfer or proposed transfer contemplated
above and by the Loan Documents, at Lender's request, Borrower shall provide an
estoppel certificate to the Investor or any prospective Investor in such form,
substance and detail as Lender may reasonably require.

         10.17 Construction. This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly
against Lender than against Borrower merely by virtue of the fact that the same
has been prepared by counsel for Lender, it being recognized that Borrower and
Lender have contributed substantially and materially to the preparation of this
Agreement. Whenever the context and construction so require, all words used in
the singular number herein shall be deemed to have been used in the plural, and
vice versa, and the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter and
the neuter shall include the masculine and feminine. Wherever used, the words
"including" or "included" shall be deemed followed by the phrase "without
limitation".

         10.18 Sole Discretion of Lender. Wherever pursuant to this Agreement
(a) Lender exercises any right given to it to approve or disapprove, (b) any
arrangement or term is to be satisfactory to Lender, or (c) any other decision
or determination is to be made by Lender, the decision of Lender to approve or
disapprove, the determination that arrangements or terms are satisfactory or not
satisfactory and all other decisions and determinations made by Lender, shall be
in the sole and absolute discretion of Lender and shall be final and conclusive,
except as may be otherwise expressly and specifically provided herein.

         10.19 Survival. All covenants, representations and warranties made
herein shall survive the making of the Loan and the delivery of the Note and
other Loan Documents. Except as hereinafter specifically set forth below, the
representations and warranties, covenants, and other obligations arising under
Section 6.4, Article 9 and Section 10.28 of this Agreement shall in no way be
impaired by: any satisfaction or other termination of the Mortgages, any
assignment or other transfer of all or any portion of this Agreement, the
Mortgages, or Lender's interest in the Properties (but, in such case, shall
benefit both Lender and any assignee or transferee), any exercise of Lender's
rights and remedies pursuant hereto including, but not limited to foreclosure or
acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, any exercise of any rights and
remedies pursuant to the Note or any of the other Loan Documents, any transfer
of all or any portion of the Properties (whether by Borrower or by Lender
following foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in

                                       69
<PAGE>
lieu of foreclosure or at any other time), any amendment to this Agreement, the
Mortgages, the Note or the other Loan Documents, and any act or omission that
might otherwise be construed as a release or discharge of Borrower from the
obligations pursuant hereto. All obligations and liabilities of Borrower under
Section 6.4, Article 9 and Section 10.28 of this Agreement shall cease and
terminate on the first (1st) anniversary of the date of payment to Lender in
cash of the entire Debt.

         10.20 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
shall constitute one and the same instrument, and in making proof of this
Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one
such counterpart.

         10.21 Captions. The captions herein are inserted only as a matter of
convenience and for reference and in no way define, limit or describe the scope
of this Agreement nor the intent of any provision hereof.

         10.22 Rights Cumulative. The obligations, rights and remedies provided
herein shall be in addition to those contained in the Note, the Mortgages and
the other Loan Documents.

         10.23 Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents constitute the entire
understanding and agreement between Borrower and Lender with respect to the
transactions arising in connection with the Loan or otherwise relating to the
Loan, and supersede all prior written or oral understandings and agreements
between Borrower and Lender with respect to the matters addressed in the Loan
Documents. Except as set forth in the Loan Documents, Lender has not made any
commitments to extend the term of the Loan past its stated maturity date or to
provide Borrower with financing. Except as incorporated in writing in the Loan
Documents, there are not, and were not, and no persons are or were authorized by
Lender to make, any representations, understandings, stipulations, agreements or
promises, oral or written, with respect to the matters addressed in the Loan
Documents.

         10.24 No Partnership, Etc. The relationship between Lender and
Borrower is solely that of lender and borrower. Lender has no fiduciary or other
special relationship with or duty to Borrower and none is created by the Loan
Documents. Nothing contained in the Loan Documents, and no action taken or
omitted pursuant to the Loan Documents, is intended or shall be construed to
create any partnership, joint venture, association or special relationship
between Borrower and Lender or in any way make Lender a co-principal with
Borrower with reference to the Project, the Property or otherwise. In no event
shall Lender's rights and interests under the Loan Documents be construed to
give Lender the right to control, or be deemed to indicate that Lender is in
control of, the business, properties, management or operations of Borrower.

         10.25 Conflicts Among Documents. In the event of any conflict between
the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the terms
and conditions of first, this

                                       70


<PAGE>
Agreement and then, the other Loan Documents shall prevail, but no such
application shall invalidate the Note or the validity or priority of the
Mortgages.

         10.26 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence in the performance of
every covenant and agreement of Borrower under this Agreement.

         10.27 Acknowledgment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that all terms and provisions
relating to "Borrower" hereunder shall be construed to be the obligations of
Portfolio, Jersey Owner or Jersey Operator, as the case may be. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the parties constituting Borrower be required
to make duplicative deliveries of any payments, certificates or other documents
or things required hereunder. Lender hereby acknowledges and agrees that
performance of the terms hereof and of the other Loan Documents by any or all of
the parties constituting Borrower shall be sufficient.

         10.28 Costs and Expenses. (a) Borrower acknowledges and confirms that
Lender shall impose certain administrative processing and/or commitment fees in
connection with (a) the extension, renewal, modification, amendment and
termination of its loans, (b) the release or substitution of collateral
therefor, (c) obtaining certain consents, waivers and approvals with respect to
the Properties, or (d) the review of any Lease or proposed Lease or the
preparation or review of any subordination, non-disturbance agreement. Borrower
further acknowledges and confirms that it shall be responsible for the payment
of all costs of reappraisal of the Properties or any part thereof, whether
required by law, regulation, Lender or any governmental or quasi-governmental
authority. Lender acknowledges and agrees that it shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize the cost of providing or producing any
reappraisals, environmental reports or other third party reports with respect to
or commissioned in connection with any Secondary Market Transaction, provided
however that Lender shall not be required to reduce or lower its standards from
those typically utilized or required in similar transactions. Borrower hereby
acknowledges and agrees to pay, immediately, with or without demand, all such
fees (as the same may be increased or decreased from time to time), and any
additional fees of a similar type or nature which may be imposed by Lender from
time to time, upon the occurrence of any such event or otherwise. Wherever it is
provided for herein that Borrower pay any costs and expenses, such costs and
expenses shall include, but not be limited to, all reasonable legal fees and
disbursements of Lender, whether of retained firms, the reimbursement for the
expenses of in-house staff or otherwise.

                  (b) (i) Borrower shall pay all legal fees incurred by Lender
in connection with (A) the preparation of the Note, this Agreement, the
Mortgages and the other Loan Documents; and (B) the items set forth in
subsection (A) above, and (ii) Borrower shall pay to Lender on demand any and
all expenses, including reasonable legal expenses and reasonable attorneys'
fees, incurred or paid by Lender in protecting its interest in the Properties or
Personal Property or in collecting any amount payable hereunder or in enforcing
its rights hereunder with respect to the Properties or Personal Property,
whether or not any legal proceeding is commenced hereunder or

                                       71
<PAGE>
thereunder and whether or not any default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and is continuing, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate
from the date paid or incurred by Lender until such expenses are paid by
Borrower.

         10.29 The Indenture of Lease. (a) With respect to the Jersey Property,
the Jersey Operator hereby represents and warrants that: (i) the Indenture of
Lease is a valid and subsisting lease of the Land and all other real and
personal property described and demised therein for the term therein set forth,
(ii) the Indenture of Lease is in full force and effect in accordance with its
respective terms; (iii) the Indenture of Lease has not been amended, modified or
altered, except as herein set forth; (iv) all rents (including additional rents
and other charges) reserved in the Indenture of Lease have been paid to the
extent they were due and payable before the date hereof, (v) there are no
existing defaults under the provisions of the Indenture of Lease or in the
performance of any of its terms, or conditions; (vi) the Jersey Operator is the
sole owner of the entire leasehold estate and the lessee's right, title and
interest under the provisions of the Indenture of Lease, and has not assigned,
transferred or encumbered any or all of the same except pursuant to the Loan
Documents; and (vii) the Jersey Operator will not, without first obtaining the
Lender's prior written consent thereto, surrender its interest in the Jersey
Property, in any manner terminate, cancel or surrender the Indenture of Lease,
permit its cancellation, termination or surrender in whole or in part, or
supplement or amend the Indenture of Lease.

                  (b) The Jersey Operator hereby covenants that it will (i) pay
when due all rents and other charges and any debt accruing under the Indenture
of Lease; (ii) at all times keep, observe, perform and satisfy all of the terms,
covenants, conditions and agreements of the Indenture of Lease on the part of
the lessee thereunder to be kept, observed and performed, (iii) promptly after
receipt of any notice of default pursuant to the terms of the Indenture of
Lease, fully and timely cure the same; (iv) do all things necessary to preserve
and keep unimpaired the rights of the lessee under the Indenture of Lease and to
prevent any default thereunder or termination, surrender, cancellation or
impairment thereof; (v) promptly notify the Lender in writing of any default by
the lessor under the Indenture of Lease in performing or observing any of the
terms, covenants or conditions on the part of the lessor to be performed or
observed, and (vi) promptly advise the Lender in writing of the giving of any
notice by the lessor under the Indenture of Lease, of any default by the Jersey
Operator, as lessee under the Indenture of Lease in performing any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of the Indenture of Lease on the part of the Jersey
Operator to be performed or observed, and shall deliver to the Lender a true
copy of such notice.

                  (c) As further and additional collateral for the obligations
and performance of the covenants set forth herein or in the provisions of the
Indenture of Lease, the Jersey Operator hereby assigns to the Lender all of its
right, title and interest as lessee under the Indenture of Lease and its rights
to terminate, disaffirm, cancel, modify, change, surrender, supplement, alter or
amend the Indenture of Lease, and any such termination, cancellation,
disaffirmance, modification, surrender, supplement, alteration or amendment of
the Indenture of Lease made without the Lender's prior written consent shall be
void and of no force and effect.


                                       72
<PAGE>
                  (d) If the Jersey Operator defaults in performing any of its
obligations under the Indenture of Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure
periods, then without limiting the generality of any other provision of this
Agreement and without waiving or releasing the Borrower from any of its
obligations hereunder, it shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder and the
Lender and any person designated by the Lender shall have all of the rights and
privileges granted to the Lender by the provisions of Article 9, including, by
way of example rather than of limitation, the absolute and immediate right to
enter in and upon the Land to such extent and as often as the Lender, in its
sole discretion, deems necessary to prevent or cure any such default by the
Jersey Operator, to the end that the Jersey Operator's rights under the
Indenture of Lease shall be kept unimpaired and free from default. Whenever the
Lender receives a notice or copy of any notice of the Jersey Operator's
nonperformance of any of its obligations under the provisions of the Indenture
of Lease, whether from the Jersey Operator or the lessor thereunder, such notice
shall constitute full protection to the Lender for any action taken or omitted
to be taken by the Lender in good faith, in reliance thereon to cure such
nonperformance.

                  (e) So long as any of the obligations secured by the Jersey
Mortgage remain unpaid, the fee title of the Jersey Owner and the Jersey
Operator's leasehold interest in the Land shall not merge, but shall always be
separate and distinct, notwithstanding any union of such estates in the Jersey
Owner under the Indenture of Lease, in the Lender or in any third party, by
purchase or otherwise; and the Jersey Operator further covenants and agrees that
if it acquires the fee simple, or any other estate, title or interest in the
Land, the Jersey Mortgage shall attach to and cover and be a first lien upon
each other estate so acquired, and it shall be considered as mortgaged, assigned
or conveyed to the Lender hereunder and the lien of the Jersey Mortgage shall
spread to cover such estate, with the same force and effect as though
specifically herein mortgaged, assigned or conveyed and spread.

         10.30 Property Tax Exemption Provisions. In accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Financial Agreement, the Jersey Property has been granted
a real estate tax abatement by the City of Jersey City pursuant to the "Long
Term Tax Exemption Law (N.J.S.A. 40A:20-1 et seq.) as more fully set forth in
SCHEDULE 5 hereof and that except as specifically set forth therein, no other
agreements regarding special tax treatment, exemptions or abatements exist with
respect to the Jersey Property.

         10.31 Waiver of Marshalling of Assets. To the fullest extent each
Borrower may legally do so, each Borrower waives all rights to a marshalling of
the assets of such Borrower, such Borrower's members, if any, and others with
interests in such Borrower, and of the Properties, or to a sale in inverse order
of alienation in the event of foreclosure of the interests hereby created, and
agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of
assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the
administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to
defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale
of the applicable Property for the collection of the related Debt without any
prior or different resort for collection, of the right of Lender or any deed of
trust trustee to the

                                       73
<PAGE>
payment of the related Debt out of the net proceeds of the Property in
preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In addition, each Borrower, for
itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of foreclosure of any
or all of the Mortgages, any equitable right otherwise available to such
Borrower which would require the separate sale of portions of the Properties or
require Lender to exhaust its remedies against any Property or any combination
of the Properties before proceeding against any other Property or combination of
Properties; and further, in the event of such foreclosure, each Borrower does
hereby expressly consent to and authorize, at the option of Lender, the
foreclosure and sale either separately or together of any combination of the
Properties.

         10.32 Confession of Judgment. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, Borrower hereby authorizes and empowers any attorney or attorneys or
the Prothonotary or Clerks of any Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or
elsewhere, to appear for Borrower in any such Court in an appropriate action
there or elsewhere brought or to be brought against Borrower at the suit of
Lender on the Note, with or without suit or declaration filed, as of any term or
time there or elsewhere to be held, and therein to CONFESS OR ENTER JUDGMENT
against Borrower for an amount equal to the obligations due hereunder, under the
Mortgages, the Note and under the other Loan Documents (with or without
acceleration of maturity), including all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.
Borrower expressly authorizes the entry of repeated judgments under this
paragraph notwithstanding any prior entry of judgment in the same or any other
court for the same obligation or part thereof.

                  BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL
IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT IT UNDERSTANDS THIS
PROVISION FOR CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT. BORROWER REPRESENTS TO LENDER THAT HOWARD
GROSSMAN, ESQ., OF THE LAW FIRM BALLARD SPAHR ANDREWS & INGERSOLL, LLP, HAS
EXPLAINED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT TO BORROWER. TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BORROWER WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO NOTICE OR A
HEARING WHICH IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEFORE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT.

         10.33 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
