                                  GENERAL TERMS

            SECTION 2.1. LOAN COMMITMENT; DISBURSEMENT TO BORROWER

            (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Lender hereby agrees to make and Borrower hereby agrees to accept the Loan on
the Closing Date.

            (b) Borrower may request and receive only one borrowing in respect
of the Loan and any amount borrowed and repaid in respect of the Loan may not be
reborrowed.

            (c) The Loan shall be evidenced by the Note and secured by the
Mortgage and the other Loan Documents.

            (d) Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loan to (i) pay certain
costs in connection with the financing of the Property, (ii) make deposits into
the Reserve Funds on the Closing Date in the amounts provided herein, (iii) pay
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the closing of the Loan, as
approved by Lender, (iv) fund any working capital requirements of the Property,
and (v) distribute the balance, if any, to its members.

            SECTION 2.2. LOAN PAYMENTS

            (a) The Loan shall bear interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to
the Note Rate. Interest shall be computed based on the daily rate produced
assuming a three hundred


                                      -16-
<PAGE>
sixty (360) day year, multiplied by the actual number of days elapsed. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, interest shall be paid in arrears.

            (b) Borrower hereby agrees to pay sums due under the Note as
follows: An initial payment of $23,706.10 is due on the Closing Date for
interest from the Closing Date through and including June 30, 2004. Thereafter,
consecutive monthly installments of interest only computed in accordance with
Section 2.2(a) shall be payable (the "IO MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT") on the first
(1st) day of each month beginning on August 1, 2004 through and including the
first (1st) day of July, 2006 (each an "IO SCHEDULED PAYMENT DATE"). Thereafter,
except as may be adjusted in accordance with the last sentence of Section
2.2(c), consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest in an amount
equal $41,467.61 shall be payable (the "P&I MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT";
collectively with the IO Monthly Payment Amount, the "MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT")
on the first (1st) day of each month beginning on August 1, 2006 (each a "P&I
SCHEDULED PAYMENT DATE"; collectively with the IO Scheduled Payment Date, each a
"SCHEDULED PAYMENT DATE") until the entire indebtedness evidenced hereby is
fully paid, except that any remaining indebtedness, if not sooner paid, shall be
due and payable on the Maturity Date.

            (c) The P&I Monthly Payment Amount shall mean the amount of interest
and principal which would be due in order to fully amortize the principal amount
of the Loan, over an amortization term of thirty (30) years assuming an annual
interest rate equal to the Note Rate, computed on the basis of a three hundred
sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days each.
Borrower expressly understands and agrees that such computation of interest
based on a three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) months
of thirty (30) days each is solely for the purpose of determining the P&I
Monthly Payment Amount, and, notwithstanding such computation, interest shall
accrue on the outstanding principal amount of the Loan as provided in Section
2.2(a) above. Borrower understands and acknowledges that such interest accrual
requirement results in more interest accruing on the Loan than if either a
thirty (30) day month and a three hundred sixty (360) day year or the actual
number of days and a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year were used to
compute the accrual of interest on the Loan. Borrower recognizes that such
interest accrual requirement will not fully amortize the Loan within the
amortization period set forth above. Following any partial prepayment occurring
solely as a result of the application of Insurance Proceeds or Awards pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
adjust the P&I Monthly Payment Amount to give effect to any such partial
prepayment, provided, however, that in no event will any such adjustment result
in any such installment becoming due and payable on any date after the Maturity
Date.

            (d) Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be
payable at P. O. Box 515228, Los Angeles, California 90051-6528, Attn:
Commercial Mortgage Loan Servicing #1777, or at such other place as the Lender
may designate from time to time in writing, on the date such payment is due, to
Lender by deposit to such account as Lender may designate by written notice to
Borrower. Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Note shall be stated to be
due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
first Business Day preceding such scheduled due date.

            (e) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, all monthly
payments made as scheduled under this Agreement and the Note shall be applied
first to the payment of interest computed at the Note Rate, and the balance
toward the reduction of the principal amount of the Note. All voluntary and
involuntary prepayments on the Note shall be applied, to the extent thereof, to
accrued but unpaid interest on the amount prepaid, to the remaining principal
amount, and any other sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan,
in such manner and order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute
discretion, including, but not limited to, application to principal installments
in inverse order of maturity. Following the occurrence of an Event of Default,
any payment made on the Note shall be applied to accrued but unpaid interest,
late charges, accrued fees, the unpaid principal amount of the Note, and any
other sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan, in such manner
and order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion.

            (f) All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under the Note or the
other Loan Documents shall be made irrespective of, and without any deduction
for, any setoff, defense or counterclaims.

            SECTION 2.3. LATE PAYMENT CHARGE

            If any regularly scheduled monthly principal or interest payment is
not paid by Borrower within five (5) days after the date the same is due,
Borrower shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of four
percent (4%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by applicable
law in order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing
such delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such
delinquent payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by applicable law.

            SECTION 2.4. PREPAYMENT; DEFEASANCE

            Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 2.4 no
voluntary prepayments, whether in whole or in part, of the Loan or any other
amount at any time due and owing under the Note can be made by Borrower or any
other Person without the express written consent of Lender.

            (a) Lockout Period. Borrower has no right to make, and Lender shall
have no obligation to accept, any voluntary prepayment, whether in whole or in
part, of the Loan during the Lockout Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
either (i) Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, accepts a full or
partial voluntary prepayment during the Lockout Period or (ii) there is an
involuntary prepayment during the Lockout Period, then, in either case, Borrower
shall, in addition to any portion of the Loan prepaid (together with all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon), pay to Lender a prepayment premium in an
amount calculated in accordance with Section 2.4(c) hereof.

            (b) Defeasance.

            (i) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 2.4 to the
      contrary, including, without limitation, subsection (a) of this Section
      2.4, at any time other than during a REMIC Prohibition Period, Borrower
      may cause the release of the Property


                                      -18-
<PAGE>
      from the lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents upon the
      satisfaction of the following conditions:

                  (A) no default shall exist under any of the Loan Documents;

                  (B) not less than thirty (30) (but not more than ninety (90))
            days prior written notice shall be given to Lender specifying a date
            on which the Defeasance Collateral (as hereinafter defined) is to be
            delivered (the "RELEASE DATE"), such date being on a Scheduled
            Payment Date; provided, however, that Borrower shall have the right
            (i) to cancel such notice by providing Lender with notice of
            cancellation not less than five (5) days prior to the scheduled
            Release Date, or (ii) to extend the scheduled Release Date until the
            next Scheduled Payment Date; provided that in each case, Borrower
            shall pay all of Lender's costs and expenses incurred as a result of
            such cancellation or extension;

                  (C) all accrued and unpaid interest and all other sums due
            under the Note, this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents up
            to the Release Date, including, without limitation, all fees, costs
            and expenses incurred by Lender and its agents in connection with
            such release (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses
            for the review and preparation of the Defeasance Security Agreement
            (as hereinafter defined) and of the other materials described in
            Section 2.4(b)(i)(D) below and any related documentation, and any
            servicing fees, Rating Agency fees or other costs related to such
            release), shall be paid in full on or prior to the Release Date;

                  (D) Borrower shall deliver to Lender on or prior to the
            Release Date:

                        (1) a pledge and security agreement, in form and
                  substance satisfactory to a prudent lender, creating a first
                  priority security interest in favor of Lender in the
                  Defeasance Collateral and the Defeasance Collateral Account,
                  each as defined herein (the "DEFEASANCE SECURITY AGREEMENT"),
                  which shall provide, among other things, that any excess
                  amounts received by Lender from the Defeasance Collateral over
                  the amounts payable by Borrower on a given Scheduled Payment
                  Date, which excess amounts are not required to cover all or
                  any portion of amounts payable on a future Scheduled Payment
                  Date, shall be refunded to Borrower promptly after each such
                  Scheduled Payment Date;

                        (2) direct non-callable obligations of the United States
                  of America (or any agency thereof to the extent acceptable to
                  the applicable Rating Agencies) or other obligations which are
                  "government securities" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16)
                  of the Investment Company Act of 1940, to the extent the
                  applicable Rating Agencies rating the Securities have
                  confirmed in writing will not cause a downgrade, withdrawal or
                  qualification of the initial, or, if higher, then applicable
                  ratings of the Securities, that provide for payments prior and
                  as close as possible to (but in no event later than) all
                  successive Scheduled Payment Dates occurring


                                      -19-
<PAGE>
                  after the Release Date, with each such payment being equal to
                  or greater than the amount of the corresponding Monthly
                  Payment Amount required to be paid under this Agreement and
                  the Note (including the amount necessary to pay the
                  outstanding principal balance of the Loan on the first
                  Scheduled Payment Date occurring after the expiration of the
                  Lockout Period) for the balance of the Lockout Period (the
                  "DEFEASANCE COLLATERAL"), each of which shall be duly endorsed
                  by the holder thereof as directed by Lender or accompanied by
                  a written instrument of transfer in form and substance wholly
                  satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion (including,
                  without limitation, such certificates, documents and
                  instruments as may be required by the depository institution
                  holding such securities or the issuer thereof, as the case may
                  be, to effectuate book-entry transfers and pledges through the
                  book-entry facilities of such institution) in order to perfect
                  upon the delivery of the Defeasance Security Agreement the
                  first priority security interest therein in favor of Lender in
                  conformity with all applicable state and federal laws
                  governing granting of such security interests;

                        (3) a certificate of Borrower certifying that all of the
                  requirements set forth in this Section 2.4(b)(i) have been
                  satisfied;

                        (4) one or more opinions of counsel for Borrower in form
                  and substance that is standard in commercial mortgage lending
                  transactions and subject only to customary qualifications,
                  assumptions and exceptions opining, among other things, that
                  (i) Lender has a perfected first priority security interest in
                  the Defeasance Collateral and the Defeasance Collateral
                  Account and that the Defeasance Security Agreement is
                  enforceable against Borrower in accordance with its terms,
                  (ii) in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding or similar
                  occurrence with respect to Borrower, none of the Defeasance
                  Collateral nor any proceeds thereof will be property of
                  Borrower's estate under Section 541 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
                  Code or any similar statute and the grant of security interest
                  therein to Lender shall not constitute an avoidable preference
                  under Section 547 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or applicable
                  state law, (iii) the release of the lien of the Mortgage and
                  the pledge of Defeasance Collateral will not directly or
                  indirectly result in or cause any REMIC Trust that then holds
                  the Note to fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and
                  (iv) the defeasance will not cause any REMIC Trust to be an
                  "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940;

                        (5) a certificate in form and scope acceptable to Lender
                  in its sole discretion from an Acceptable Accountant or such
                  other accountant whose certification is customarily acceptable
                  by lenders in defeasance transactions certifying that the
                  Defeasance Collateral will generate amounts sufficient to make
                  all payments of principal and interest due under the Note
                  (including the scheduled outstanding principal balance of the
                  Loan due on the Maturity Date); and


                                      -20-
<PAGE>
                        (6) such other certificates, documents and instruments
                  customarily delivered in connection with similar defeasance
                  transactions as Lender may in its sole and reasonable
                  discretion require; and

                  (E) in the event the Loan is held by a REMIC Trust, Lender has
            received written confirmation from any Rating Agency rating any
            Securities that substitution of the Defeasance Collateral will not
            result in a downgrade, withdrawal, or qualification of the ratings
            then assigned to any of the Securities.

            (ii) Upon compliance with the requirements of Section 2.4(b)(i), the
      Property shall be released from the lien of the Mortgage and the other
      Loan Documents, and the Defeasance Collateral shall constitute collateral
      which shall secure the Note and all other obligations under the Loan
      Documents. Lender will, at Borrower's expense, execute and deliver any
      agreements reasonably requested by Borrower to release the lien of the
      Mortgage and the other Loan Documents from the Property.

            (iii) Upon the release of the Property in accordance with this
      Section 2.4(b), Borrower shall (at Lender's sole and absolute discretion)
      assign all its obligations and rights under the Note, together with the
      pledged Defeasance Collateral, to a successor entity designated and
      approved by Lender in its sole and reasonable discretion ("SUCCESSOR
      BORROWER"). Successor Borrower shall execute an assignment and assumption
      agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in its sole and
      reasonable discretion pursuant to which it shall assume Borrower's
      obligations under the Note and the Defeasance Security Agreement. As
      conditions to such assignment and assumption, Borrower shall (A) deliver
      to Lender one or more opinions of counsel in form and substance that is
      standard in commercial mortgage lending transactions and subject only to
      customary qualifications, assumptions and exceptions opining, among other
      things, that such assignment and assumption agreement is enforceable
      against Borrower and the Successor Borrower in accordance with its terms
      and that the Note, the Defeasance Security Agreement and the other Loan
      Documents, as so assigned and assumed, are enforceable against the
      Successor Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, and opining
      to such other matters relating to Successor Borrower and its
      organizational structure as Lender may reasonably require, and (B) pay all
      reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by Lender or its agents in
      connection with such assignment and assumption (including, without
      limitation, legal fees and expenses and for the review of the proposed
      transferee and the preparation of the assignment and assumption agreement
      and related certificates, documents and instruments and any fees payable
      to any Rating Agencies and their counsel in connection with the issuance
      of the confirmation referred to in subsection (b)(i)(E) above). Upon such
      assignment and assumption, Borrower shall be relieved of its obligations
      hereunder, under the Note, under the other Loan Documents and under the
      Defeasance Security Agreement, except as expressly set forth in the
      assignment and assumption agreement.

            (iv) For purposes of this Section 2.4, "REMIC PROHIBITION PERIOD"
      means the earlier of (x) the period commencing on the date hereof and
      ending on the date which is four (4) years after the first Scheduled
      Payment Date following the date hereof or (y) the two-year period
      commencing with the "startup day" within the meaning of Section


                                      -21-
<PAGE>
      860G(a)(9) of the Code of any REMIC Trust that holds the Note. In no event
      shall Lender have any obligation to notify Borrower that a REMIC
      Prohibition Period is in effect with respect to the Loan, except that
      Lender shall notify Borrower if any REMIC Prohibition Period is in effect
      with respect to the Loan after receiving any notice described in Section
      2.4(b)(i)(B); provided, however, that the failure of Lender to so notify
      Borrower shall not impose any liability on Lender or grant Borrower any
      right to defease the Loan during any such REMIC Prohibition Period.

            (v) At Borrower's request, Lender shall assign the Security
      Instrument and the Note, each without recourse, covenant or warranty of
      any nature, express or implied, except that Lender is the holder of the
      Note and the outstanding amount owed under the Note by Borrower to such
      new mortgagee designated by Borrower (other than Borrower or a nominee of
      Borrower) provided that Borrower or Successor Borrower, as applicable (i)
      has executed and delivered to such new mortgagee a new note to be secured
      by the Defeasance Collateral pursuant to the Defeasance Security Agreement
      between Borrower and such new mortgagee (such new note to have the same
      term, interest rate, unpaid principal balance and all other material terms
      and conditions of the Note), which new note, together with the Defeasance
      Security Agreement and the rights of such new mortgagee in and to the
      Defeasance Collateral, shall be assigned by such new mortgagee to Lender
      simultaneously with the assignment of the Note and Security Instrument by
      Lender and (ii) has complied with all other provisions of this Section
      2.4(b) to the extent not inconsistent with this subparagraph (v). In
      addition, any such assignment shall be conditioned on the following: (A)
      payment by Borrower of (I) Lender's then customary administrative fee for
      processing assignments of mortgage; (II) the reasonable expenses of Lender
      incurred in connection therewith; and (III) Lender's reasonable attorney's
      fees for the preparation, delivery and performance of such an assignment;
      (B) such new mortgagee shall not substantially modify the Note such that
      it shall be treated as a new loan for federal tax purposes; (C) such an
      assignment is not then prohibited by any federal, state or local law,
      rule, regulation, order or by any other governmental authority; (D) such
      assignment and the actions described above do not constitute a prohibited
      transaction for any REMIC Trust formed in connection with a Securitization
      and will not disqualify such REMIC Trust as a "real estate mortgage
      investment conduit" within the meaning of Section 860D of the Code as a
      result of such assignment and the Defeasance, and an opinion of counsel to
      Borrower that is standard in commercial mortgage lending transactions and
      subject only to customary qualifications, assumptions and exceptions; and
      (E) Borrower shall provide such other opinions, items, information and
      documents which a prudent lender would require to effectuate such
      assignment. Borrower shall be responsible for all mortgage recording
      taxes, recording fees and other charges payable in connection with any
      such assignment. Lender agrees that the assignment of the Note and
      Security Instrument to the new mortgagee and the assignment of the new
      note, the Defeasance Collateral and the Defeasance Security Agreement by
      the new mortgagee to Lender shall be accomplished by an escrow closing
      conducted through an escrow agent satisfactory to Lender and pursuant to
      an escrow agreement satisfactory to Lender in form and substance.

            (c) Involuntary Prepayment During the Lockout Period. During the
Lockout Period, in the event of any involuntary prepayment of the Loan or any
other amount under the


                                      -22-
<PAGE>
Note, whether in whole or in part, in connection with or following Lender's
acceleration of the Note or otherwise, and whether the Mortgage is satisfied or
released by foreclosure (whether by power of sale or judicial proceeding), deed
in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means, including, without limitation,
repayment of the Loan by Borrower or any other Person pursuant to any statutory
or common law right of redemption, Borrower shall, in addition to any portion of
the principal balance of the Loan prepaid (together with all interest accrued
and unpaid thereon and in the event the prepayment is made on a date other than
a Scheduled Payment Date, a sum equal to the amount of interest which would have
accrued under the Note on the amount of such prepayment if such prepayment had
occurred on the next Scheduled Payment Date), pay to Lender a prepayment premium
in an amount calculated in accordance with this Section 2.4(c). Such prepayment
premium shall be in an amount equal to the greater of:

            (i) 1% of the portion of the Loan being prepaid; or

            (ii) the product obtained by multiplying:

                  (A) the portion of the Loan being prepaid, times;

                  (B) the difference obtained by subtracting (I) the Yield Rate
            from (II) the Note Rate, times;

                  (C) the present value factor calculated using the following
            formula:

                        1-(1+r)-(n)
                        -----------
                             r

                        r =    Yield Rate

                        n =    the number of years and any fraction thereof,
                               remaining between the date the prepayment is made
                               and first Scheduled Payment Date occurring after
                               the expiration of the Lockout Period.

            As used herein, "YIELD RATE" means the yield calculated by the
linear interpolation of the yields, as reported in the Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15-Selected Interest Rates under the heading "U.S.
government securities" and the sub-heading "Treasury constant maturities" for
the week ending prior to the Prepayment Calculation Date, of the U.S. Treasury
constant maturities with maturity dates (one longer and one equal to or shorter)
most nearly approximating the Maturity Date, and converted to a monthly
compounded nominal yield. In the event Release H.15 is no longer published,
Lender shall select a comparable publication to determine the Yield Rate. The
"PREPAYMENT CALCULATION DATE" shall mean, as applicable, the date on which (i)
Lender applies any partial prepayment to the reduction of the outstanding
principal amount the Note, in the case of a voluntary partial prepayment which
is accepted by Lender, (ii) Lender accelerates the Loan, in the case of a
prepayment resulting from acceleration, or (iii) Lender applies funds held under
any Reserve Account, in the case of a prepayment resulting from such an
application (other than in connection with acceleration of the Loan).


                                      -23-
<PAGE>
            (d) Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds; Excess Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, and provided no
Event of Default exists, Borrower shall not be required to pay any prepayment
premium in connection with any prepayment occurring solely as a result of (i)
the application of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Documents, or (ii) the application of any interest in excess
of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law to the reduction of the Loan.

            (e) After the Lockout Period. Commencing on the day after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, and upon giving Lender at least thirty (30)
days (but not more than ninety (90) days) prior written notice, Borrower may
voluntarily prepay (without premium) the Note in whole (but not in part) on a
Scheduled Payment Date. Lender shall accept a prepayment pursuant to this
Section 2.4(e) on a day other than a Scheduled Payment Date provided that, in
addition to payment of the full outstanding principal balance of the Note,
Borrower pays to Lender a sum equal to the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the Note if such prepayment occurred on the next Scheduled Payment
Date.

            (f) Limitation on Partial Prepayments. In no event shall Lender have
any obligation to accept a partial prepayment.

            (g) Intentionally Reserved.

            (h) Defeasance Collateral Account. On or before the date on which
Borrower delivers the Defeasance Collateral, Borrower shall open at any Eligible
Institution the defeasance collateral account (the "DEFEASANCE COLLATERAL
ACCOUNT") which shall at all times be an Eligible Account. The Defeasance
Collateral Account shall contain only (i) Defeasance Collateral, and (ii) cash
from interest and principal paid on the Defeasance Collateral. All cash from
interest and principal payments paid on the Defeasance Collateral shall be paid
over to Lender on each Scheduled Payment Date and applied first to accrued and
unpaid interest and then to principal. Any cash from interest and principal paid
on the Defeasance Collateral not needed to pay the Scheduled Defeasance Payments
shall be paid to Borrower. Borrower shall cause the Eligible Institution at
which the Defeasance Collateral is deposited to enter an agreement with Borrower
and Lender, satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion, pursuant to which
such Eligible Institution shall agree to hold and distribute the Defeasance
Collateral in accordance with this Agreement. The Borrower or Successor
Borrower, as applicable, shall be the owner of the Defeasance Collateral Account
and shall report all income accrued on the Defeasance Collateral for federal,
state and local income tax purposes in its income tax return. Borrower shall
prepay all cost and expenses associated with opening and maintaining the
Defeasance Collateral Account. Lender shall not in any way be liable by reason
of any insufficiency in the Defeasance Collateral Account.

            SECTION 2.5. PAYMENTS AFTER DEFAULT

            Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the
extent permitted by law, other amounts due in respect of the Loan, (a) shall
accrue at the Default Rate, and (b) Lender shall be entitled to receive and
Borrower shall pay to Lender all cash flow from the Property in accordance with
the terms of Article 10 hereof, such amount to be applied by Lender to the


                                      -24-
<PAGE>
payment of the Debt in such order as Lender shall determine in its sole
discretion, including, without limitation, alternating applications thereof
between interest and principal. Interest at the Default Rate shall be computed
from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the earlier of (i) the actual
receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion thereof that is then due)
and (ii) the cure of such Event of Default. This paragraph shall not be
construed as an agreement or privilege to extend the date of the payment of the
Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right or remedy accruing to Lender by reason
of the occurrence of any Event of Default; the acceptance of any payment from
Borrower shall not be deemed to cure or constitute a waiver of any Event of
Default; and Lender retains its rights under this Agreement to accelerate and to
continue to demand payment of the Debt upon the happening of and during the
continuance any Event of Default, despite any payment by Borrower to Lender.

            SECTION 2.6. USURY SAVINGS

            This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition
that at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the
principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject Lender to either
civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate. If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower
is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance
due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Note Rate or
the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced
to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum
Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and
not on account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid
to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and
applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on and as

Rights Laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrower's assets or
property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing

neither Borrower nor Borrower Principal has asserted any right


                                      -32-

flood hazards, or, if any portion of the Improvements (it being understood that

buildings, improvements, parking facilities, sidewalks, storm drainage systems,
roofs, electrical systems, equipment, landscaping, irrigation systems and all
structural components, are in good condition, order and repair in all material
respects in light of the age, design and utility. To Borrower's knowledge after
due inquiry, there exists no structural or other material defects or damages in
the Property, as a result of a Casualty or otherwise, and whether latent or
otherwise. Borrower has not received notice from any insurance company or
bonding company of any defects or inadequacies in the Property, or any part
thereof, which would adversely affect the insurability of the same or cause the
imposition of extraordinary premiums or charges thereon or of any termination or
threatened termination of any policy of insurance or bond.

            SECTION 4.24. BOUNDARIES

            Except as shown in the Title Insurance Policy or as shown on the
Survey, (a) none of the Improvements which were included in determining the
appraised value of the Property lie outside the boundaries and building
restriction lines of the Property to any material extent, and (b) no
improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the Property and no easements
or other encumbrances upon the Property encroach upon any of the Improvements so
as to materially affect the value or marketability of the Property.

            Borrower has delivered to Lender a true, correct and complete rent
roll for the Property (a "RENT ROLL") which includes all Leases affecting the
Property. Except as set forth in the Rent Roll (as same has been updated by
written notice thereof to Lender) and estoppel certificates delivered to Lender
on or prior to the Closing Date: (a) each Lease is in full force and effect; (b)

                                      -35-
<PAGE>
Tenant under any Lease; (d) all Rents due and payable under the Leases have been
paid and no substantial portion thereof has been paid for any period more than
thirty (30) days in advance; (e) the rent payable under each Lease is the amount
of fixed rent set forth in the Rent Roll, and, to Borrower's knowledge, there is
no claim or basis for a claim by the Tenant thereunder for an offset or
adjustment to the rent; (f) no Tenant has made any written claim of a material
default against the landlord under any Lease which remains outstanding nor has
Borrower or Manager received, by telephonic, in-person, e-mail or other
communication, any notice of a material default under any Lease; (g) to
Borrower's knowledge there is no present material default by the Tenant under
any Lease; (h) all security deposits under the Leases have been collected by
Borrower; (i) Borrower is the sole owner of the entire landlord's interest in
each Lease; (j) to Borrower's knowledge, each Lease is the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Borrower and the applicable Tenant thereunder and
there are no agreements between the Borrower and Tenants under the Leases other
than as expressly set forth in the Leases; (k) no Person has any possessory
interest in, or right to occupy, the Property or any portion thereof except
under the terms of a Lease or the Permitted Encumbrances; (l) none of the Leases
contains any option or offer to purchase or right of first refusal to purchase
the Property or any part thereof (except as may be required by any applicable
Legal Requirements); and (m) neither the Leases nor the Rents have been
assigned, pledged or hypothecated except to Lender, and, to Borrower's
knowledge, no other Person has any interest therein except the Tenants
thereunder. Lender hereby recognizes that in addition to the Leases, the
relationship between the Borrower and the Tenants of the Property may be
governed by the terms of an agreement between the Borrower (or its predecessor
in interest) and the homeowners association established by the Tenants of the
Property and the prospectus for the Property filed with the State where the
Property is located.

            SECTION 4.26. FILING AND RECORDING TAXES

            All mortgage, mortgage recording, stamp, intangible or other similar

including, without limitation, the Mortgage, have been paid or will be paid,

            All costs and expenses of any and all labor, materials, supplies and
equipment used in the construction maintenance or repair of the Improvements

                                      -36-

are or may become a lien prior to, or of equal priority with, the Liens created
by the Loan Documents.

            SECTION 4.30. PERSONAL PROPERTY

            Borrower has paid in full for, and is the owner of, all Personal
Property (other than tenants' property) used in connection with the operation of
the Property, free and clear of any and all security interests, liens or
encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances and the Lien and security
interest created by the Loan Documents.

            SECTION 4.31. TAXES

assessments received by them. Neither Borrower nor Borrower Principal knows of
any basis for any additional assessment in respect of any such taxes and related
liabilities for prior years.

            SECTION 4.32. PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES

            None of the Permitted Encumbrances, individually or in the

the Property, materially impairs the use or the operation of the Property or
materially impairs Borrower's ability to pay its obligations in a timely manner.

            SECTION 4.33. FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS

            Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loan for the purposes set
forth in Section 2.1(d) hereof and not for any illegal activity. No part of the
proceeds of the Loan will be used for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring any
"margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System or for any other purpose which would be inconsistent
with such Regulation U or any other Regulations of such Board of Governors, or
for any purposes prohibited by Legal Requirements or prohibited by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

            SECTION 4.34. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT

            All information submitted by Borrower or its agents to Lender and in
all financial statements, rent rolls, reports, certificates and other documents
submitted in connection with the Loan or in satisfaction of the terms thereof
and all statements of fact made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any other
Loan Document, are accurate, complete and correct in all material respects.
There has been no material adverse change in any condition, fact, circumstance
or event that would make any such information inaccurate, incomplete or
otherwise misleading in any material respect or that otherwise materially and
adversely affects or might materially and adversely affect the Property or the
business operations or the financial condition of Borrower. To Borrower's
knowledge, Borrower has disclosed to Lender all material facts relating to
Borrower, Borrower Principal and the Property and has not failed to disclose any
material fact relating to Borrower, Borrower Principal and the Property that
could cause any representation or warranty made herein to be materially
misleading.

            SECTION 4.37. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

            To Borrower's knowledge, all trademarks, trade names and service
marks necessary to the business of Borrower as presently conducted or as
Borrower contemplates conducting its business are in good standing, except any
such trademarks, trade names and service marks which, if not in good standing,
would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and, to the extent of Borrower's
actual knowledge, uncontested. Borrower has not infringed, is not infringing,
and has not received notice of infringement with respect to asserted trademarks,
trade names and service marks of others. To Borrower's knowledge, there is no
infringement by others of trademarks, trade names and service marks of Borrower.

            SECTION 4.38. SURVEY

            The Survey for the Property delivered to Lender in connection with

            As of the date hereof and at all times throughout the term of the
Loan, including after giving effect to any transfers of interests permitted

Borrower and Borrower Principal constitute property of, or are beneficially
owned, directly or indirectly, by any person, entity or government subject to
trade restrictions under U.S. law, including but not limited to, the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. Sections 1701 et seq.,
The Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq., and any Executive
Orders or regulations promulgated thereunder with the result that the investment

none of the funds of Borrower or Borrower Principal, as applicable, have been
derived from any unlawful activity with the result that the investment in
Borrower or Borrower Principal, as applicable (whether directly or indirectly),
is prohibited by law or the Loan is in violation of law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4.39, neither Borrower nor
Borrower Principal is making any such representation or warranty with respect to

the representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in this Agreement and
elsewhere in this Agreement and in the other Loan Documents shall survive for so

warranties, covenants and agreements made in this Agreement or in the other Loan
Documents by Borrower shall be deemed to have been relied upon by Lender
notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by Lender or on
its behalf; provided, however, Lender shall not be entitled to rely upon such
representation or warranty if any employee of Lender who has been actively
involved with the making of the Loan has actual knowledge that such
representation or warranty is false as of the date made.

            SECTION 4.43. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

            Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, any
covenant, representation, warranty, undertaking or agreement made by Borrower
Principal hereunder is being made by Borrower Principal only with respect to

making any covenant, representation, warranty, undertaking or agreement with
respect to the Borrower, the Property or any other matter herein; provided,
however, nothing in this Section shall in any way limit the liability and
obligations of Borrower or Borrower Principal if Borrower and/or Borrower
Principal breaches any covenant, representation or warranty which gives rise to

performance in full of all obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents or
the earlier release of the Lien of the Mortgage (and all related obligations) in

Borrower hereby covenants and agrees with Lender that:

            SECTION 5.1. EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

            (a) Borrower shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to
preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights,

                                      -40-
<PAGE>
covenants and agrees not to commit, permit or suffer to exist any act or
omission affording any Governmental Authority the right of forfeiture as against
the Property or any part thereof or any monies paid in performance of Borrower's
obligations under any of the Loan Documents. Borrower shall at all times
maintain, preserve and protect all franchises and trade names used in connection
with the operation of the Property.

            (b) Borrower, at its own expense, may contest by appropriate legal
proceeding, promptly initiated and conducted in good faith and with due
diligence, the Legal Requirements affecting the Property, provided that (i) no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (ii) such proceeding
shall be permitted under and be conducted in accordance with the provisions of
any other instrument to which Borrower or the Property is subject and shall not
constitute a default thereunder; (iii) neither the Property, any part thereof or
interest therein, any of the tenants or occupants thereof, nor Borrower shall be
affected in any material adverse way as a result of such proceeding; (iv)
non-compliance with the Legal Requirements shall not impose civil or criminal
liability on Borrower or Lender and (v) Borrower shall have furnished to Lender

            Borrower shall cause the Property to be maintained in a good and
safe condition and repair. The Improvements and the Personal Property shall not
be removed or demolished other than in accordance with the provisions of Section
5.21, materially altered (except for normal replacement of the Personal Property
or as otherwise permitted herein) without the prior written consent of Lender.
If under applicable zoning provisions the use of all or any portion of the
Property is or shall become a nonconforming use, Borrower will not cause or
permit the nonconforming use to be discontinued or the nonconforming Improvement
to be abandoned without the express written consent of Lender.

            SECTION 5.3. WASTE

            Borrower shall not commit or suffer any waste of the Property or
make any change in the use of the Property which will in any way materially
increase the risk of fire or other hazard arising out of the operation of the
Property, or take any action that is likely to invalidate or give cause for
cancellation of any Policy, or do or permit to be done thereon anything that is
likely to materially impair the value of the Property or the security for the
Loan. Borrower will not, without the prior written consent of Lender, and except
to the extent required under the Permitted Encumbrances, permit any drilling or
exploration for or extraction, removal, or production of any minerals from the

            (a) Borrower shall pay all Taxes and Other Charges now or hereafter
levied or assessed or imposed against the Property or any part thereof before
the same become delinquent; provided, however, Borrower's obligation to directly
pay Taxes shall be suspended for so long as Borrower complies with the terms and
provisions of Section 9.6 hereof. Borrower shall furnish to Lender receipts for
the payment of the Taxes and the Other Charges prior to the date the same


                                      -41-
<PAGE>
shall become delinquent (provided, however, that Borrower is not required to
furnish such receipts for payment of Taxes in the event that such Taxes have
been paid by Lender pursuant to Section 9.6 hereof). Borrower shall not suffer
and shall promptly cause to be paid and discharged any Lien or charge whatsoever
which may be or become a Lien or charge against the Property, and shall promptly
pay for all utility services provided to the Property.

            (b) After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own
expense, may contest by appropriate legal proceeding, promptly initiated and
conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the amount or validity or
application in whole or in part of any Taxes or Other Charges, provided that (i)
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured; (ii) such
proceeding shall be permitted under and be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of any other instrument to which Borrower is subject and shall not
constitute a default thereunder and such proceeding shall be conducted in
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements; (iii) neither the Property
nor any part thereof or interest therein will be in danger of being sold,
forfeited, terminated, canceled or lost; (iv) Borrower shall promptly upon final
determination thereof pay the amount of any such Taxes or Other Charges,
together with all costs, interest and penalties which may be payable in
connection therewith; (v) such proceeding shall suspend the collection of such
contested Taxes or Other Charges from the Property; and (vi) if Borrower is
required to make reserve deposits, or deliver a Letter of Credit, to Lender for
Taxes and Other Charges, then Borrower shall furnish such security as may be
required in the proceeding, or deliver to Lender such reserve deposits as may be
requested by Lender, to insure the payment of any such Taxes or Other Charges,
together with all interest and penalties thereon (unless Borrower has paid all
of the Taxes or Other Charges under protest). Lender may pay over any such cash
deposit or part thereof held by Lender to the claimant entitled thereto at any
time when, in the judgment of Lender, the entitlement of such claimant is
established or the Property (or part thereof or interest therein) shall be in
danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, canceled or lost or there shall be
any danger of the Lien of the Mortgage being primed by any related Lien.

            SECTION 5.5. LITIGATION

            Borrower shall give prompt written notice to Lender of any
litigation or governmental proceedings pending or threatened in writing against

the Property or of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default of which
Borrower has knowledge.

            Borrower shall at Borrower's expense cooperate fully with Lender

connection therewith, permit Lender, at its election, to participate in any such
proceedings.

            SECTION 5.9. PERFORMANCE BY BORROWER

            Borrower shall in a timely manner observe, perform and fulfill in
all material respects each and every covenant, term and provision to be observed

imposed upon the landlord under the Leases and shall not do or permit to be done

Leases upon the part of the Tenant thereunder to be observed or performed, short

recreational vehicle community residential property, a residential Lease may be
terminated in the event of a default by the tenant thereunder; (iii) shall not
collect any of the Rents more than one (1) month in advance, except for (A)
Rents aggregating in an amount equal to less than five percent (5.0%) of the
Operating Income of the Property and (B) Rents collected with respect to
recreational vehicle sites; and (iv) shall not execute any other assignment of
the landlord's interest in the Leases or the Rents.

            (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, renewals
of existing commercial Leases and proposed Leases for commercial space shall not
be subject to the prior approval of Lender, provided all of the following
conditions are satisfied: (i) the rental income pursuant to the renewal or
proposed Lease is not more than five (5%) percent of the total


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

have agreed to attorn to Lender, (iv) the renewal or proposed Lease is on the
standard form of lease approved by Lender, (v) the renewal or proposed Lease
does not contain any option, offer, right of first refusal, or other similar
right to acquire all or any portion of the Property, and (vi) the renewal or
proposed Lease provides for rental rates and terms comparable to existing market
rates and terms and is an arm's-length transaction with a bona fide, independent
third party tenant. Borrower shall deliver to Lender copies of all Leases which
are entered into pursuant to the preceding sentence together with Borrower's
certification that it has satisfied all of the conditions of the preceding
sentence within thirty (30) days after the execution of the Lease.

            (a) Borrower shall not engage in any transaction which would cause
any obligation, or action taken or to be taken, hereunder (or the exercise by

Each SPE Component Entity (i) will at all times comply with each of the


                                      -51-

status, no SPE Component Entity shall be required.

            (c) In the event Borrower is a single member Delaware limited
liability company, the limited liability company agreement of Borrower (the "LLC

company interest in Borrower and the admission of the transferee in accordance
with the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement, or (B) the resignation of Member
and the admission of an additional member of Borrower in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement), any person acting as
Independent Director of Borrower shall, without any action of any other Person
and simultaneously with the Member ceasing to be the member of Borrower,
automatically be admitted to Borrower ("SPECIAL MEMBER") and shall continue
Borrower without dissolution and (ii) Special Member may not resign from
Borrower or transfer its rights as Special Member unless (A) a successor Special

shall not limit the obligations of Special Member, in its capacity as
Independent Director, to vote on such matters required by the Loan Documents or
the LLC Agreement. In order to implement the admission to Borrower of Special
Member, Special Member shall execute a counterpart to the LLC Agreement. Prior
to its admission to Borrower as Special Member, Special Member shall not be a

be a member of Borrower, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the personal
representative of Member shall, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of
the event that terminated the continued membership of Member in Borrower, agree
in writing (i) to continue Borrower and (ii) to the admission of the personal
representative or its nominee or designee, as the case may be, as a substitute
member of Borrower, effective as of the occurrence of the event that terminated
the continued membership of Member of Borrower in Borrower. Any action initiated
by or brought against Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws
shall not cause Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of Borrower and
upon the occurrence of such an event, the business of Borrower shall continue
without dissolution. The LLC Agreement shall provide that each of Member and
Special Member waives any right it might have to agree in writing to dissolve
Borrower upon the occurrence of any action initiated by or brought against
Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws, or the occurrence of
an event that causes Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of
Borrower.

            SECTION 6.2. CHANGE OF NAME, IDENTITY OR STRUCTURE

            Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed (a) Borrower's
name, (b) Borrower's identity (including its trade name or names) although
Borrower may change the name of the Property without prior notice to, or the
consent of, Lender, (c) Borrower's principal place of business set forth on the
first page of this Agreement, (d) the corporate, partnership or other
organizational structure of Borrower, each SPE Component Entity (if any), or

organizational identification number, without in each case notifying Lender of
such change in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of
such change and, in the case of a change in Borrower's structure, without first
obtaining the prior written consent of Lender. In addition, Borrower shall not
change or permit to be changed any organizational documents of Borrower or any
SPE Component Entity (if any) if such change would adversely impact the
covenants set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.4 hereof. Borrower authorizes
Lender to file any financing statement or financing statement amendment required
by Lender to establish or maintain the validity, perfection and priority of the
security interest granted herein. At the request of Lender, Borrower shall
execute a certificate in form satisfactory to Lender listing the trade names
under which Borrower intends to operate the Property, and representing and
warranting that Borrower does business under no other trade name with respect to
the Property. If Borrower does not now have an organizational identification
number and later obtains one, or if the organizational identification number
assigned to Borrower subsequently changes, Borrower shall promptly notify Lender
of such organizational identification number or change.

            SECTION 6.3. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

            Borrower will qualify to do business and will remain in good
standing under the laws of the State as and to the extent the same are required
for the ownership, maintenance, management and operation of the Property.

there to be, at least two Independent Directors of such SPE Component Entity
reasonably satisfactory to Lender.

            (b) The organizational documents of each SPE Component Entity (if
any) shall provide that the board of directors of such SPE Component Entity

Action there shall be at least two (2) members of the board of directors who are
Independent Directors. Such SPE Component Entity will not, without the unanimous
written consent of its board of directors including each Independent Director,
on behalf of itself or Borrower, (i) file or consent to the filing of any
petition, either voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any applicable
Creditors Rights Laws; (ii) seek or consent to the appointment of a receiver,
liquidator or any similar official; (iii) take any action that might cause such
entity to become insolvent; or (iv) make an assignment for the benefit of

a condition to each such transfer, Lender shall receive not less than thirty
(30) days prior written notice of such proposed transfer (c) the sale or
transfer of stock in SCI provided such stock is listed on a nationally
recognized stock exchange, (d) subject to providing prior notice to Lender,
transfers of the direct or indirect interest in Borrower by and among SCI, SCOLP

<PAGE>

and the SPE Component Entity, if any). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
transfer that results in any Person owning in excess of forty-nine percent (49%)
of the ownership interest in a Restricted Party shall comply with the
requirements of Section 7.4 hereof.

            SECTION 7.4. LENDER'S RIGHTS

            Lender reserves the right to condition the consent to a Prohibited
Transfer requested hereunder upon (a) a modification of the terms hereof (other
than the economic terms) and an assumption of the Note and the other Loan
Documents as so modified by the proposed Prohibited Transfer, (b) receipt of
payment of a transfer fee equal to (i) one-fourth of one percent (0.25%) of the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan with respect to the first such
transfer, and (ii) one percent (1%) of the outstanding principal balance of the
Loan with respect to each transfer after the first such transfer and all of
Lender's expenses incurred in connection with such Prohibited Transfer, (c)
receipt of written confirmation from the Rating Agencies that the Prohibited
Transfer will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
initial, or if higher, then current ratings issued in connection with a
Securitization, or if a Securitization has not occurred, any ratings to be
assigned in connection with a Securitization, (d) the proposed transferee's
continued compliance with the covenants set forth in this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the covenants in Article 6) and the other Loan Documents,
(e) the Property being managed by a Qualified Manager and a new management
agreement satisfactory to Lender, and (f) the satisfaction of such other
conditions and/or legal opinions as Lender shall determine in its sole
discretion to be in the interest of Lender. All expenses incurred by Lender
shall be payable by Borrower whether or not Lender consents to the Prohibited
Transfer. Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual impairment of
its security or any increased risk of default hereunder in order to declare the
Debt immediately due and payable upon a Prohibited Transfer made without
Lender's consent. This provision shall apply to each and every Prohibited
Transfer, whether or not Lender has consented to any previous Prohibited
Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
7.4, in the event a substantive non-consolidation opinion was delivered to
Lender and the Rating Agencies in connection with the closing of the Loan, and
if any Sale or Pledge permitted under this Article 7 results in any Person and
its Affiliates owning in excess of forty-nine percent (49%) of the ownership
interests in a Restricted Party, Borrower shall, prior to such transfer, and in
addition to any other requirement for Lender consent contained herein, deliver a
revised substantive non-consolidation opinion to Lender reflecting such
Prohibited Transfer, which opinion shall be in form, scope and substance
acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies.

            SECTION 7.5. ASSUMPTION

            Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 7,
following the date which is six (6) months from the Closing Date, Lender shall
not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition consent to a transfer of the
Property in its entirety to or of one hundred percent (100%) of the ownership
interests in the Borrower, and the related assumption of the Loan by, any Person
(a "TRANSFEREE") provided that each of the following terms and conditions are
satisfied:

            (a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred;


                                      -56-
<PAGE>
            (b) Borrower shall have (i) delivered written notice to Lender of
the terms of such prospective transfer not less than thirty (30) days before the
date on which such transfer is scheduled to close and, concurrently therewith,
all such information concerning the proposed Transferee as Lender shall
reasonably require and (ii) paid to Lender a non-refundable processing fee in
the amount of $10,000. Lender shall have the right to approve or disapprove the
proposed transfer based on its then current underwriting and credit requirements
for similar loans secured by similar properties which loans are sold in the
secondary market, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. In determining whether to give or withhold its approval of the proposed
transfer, Lender shall consider the experience and track record of Transferee
and its principals in owning and operating facilities similar to the Property,
the financial strength of Transferee and its principals, the general business
standing of Transferee and its principals and Transferee's and its principals'
relationships and experience with contractors, vendors, tenants, lenders and
other business entities; provided, however, that, notwithstanding Lender's
agreement to consider the foregoing factors in determining whether to give or
withhold such approval, such approval shall be given or withheld based on what
Lender determines to be commercially reasonable and, if given, may be given
subject to such conditions as Lender may deem reasonably appropriate. In no
event shall Lender consent to a proposed transfer prior to a Securitization if
the consideration to be paid by the Transferee for the Property, as determined
by Lender in its sole discretion, is less than the appraised value of the
Property as determined by Lender based upon the Appraisal delivered to Lender in
connection with Lender's underwriting of the Loan;

            (c) Borrower shall have paid to Lender, concurrently with the
closing of such transfer, (i) a non-refundable assumption fee in an amount equal
to (A) one-fourth of one percent (0.25%) of the outstanding principal balance of
the Note with respect to the first such assumption, and (B) one percent (1.0%)
of the then outstanding principal balance of the Note with respect to each
assumption after the first such assumption, and (ii) all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by Lender in connection
with the transfer;

            (d) Transferee assumes and agrees to pay the Debt as and when due
subject to the provisions of Article 15 hereof and, prior to or concurrently
with the closing of such transfer, Transferee and its constituent partners,
members or shareholders as Lender may require, shall execute, without any cost
or expense to Lender, such documents and agreements as Lender shall reasonably
require to evidence and effectuate said assumption;

            (e) Borrower and Transferee, without any cost to Lender, shall
furnish any information requested by Lender for the preparation of, and shall
authorize Lender to file, new financing statements and financing statement
amendments and other documents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, and shall execute any additional documents reasonably requested by Lender;

            (f) Borrower shall have delivered to Lender, without any cost or
expense to Lender, such endorsements to Lender's Title Insurance Policy insuring
that fee simple or leasehold title to the Property, as applicable, is vested in
Transferee (subject to Permitted Encumbrances), hazard insurance endorsements or
certificates and other similar materials as


                                      -57-
<PAGE>
Lender may deem necessary at the time of the transfer, all in form and substance
satisfactory to Lender;

            (g) Transferee shall have furnished to Lender, if Transferee is a
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity, all
appropriate papers evidencing Transferee's organization and good standing, and
the qualification of the signers to execute the assumption of the Debt, which
papers shall include certified copies of all documents relating to the
organization and formation of Transferee and of the entities, if any, which are
partners or members of Transferee. Transferee and such constituent partners,
members or shareholders of Transferee (as the case may be), as Lender shall
require, shall comply with the covenants set forth in Article 6 hereof;

            (h) Transferee shall assume the obligations of Borrower under any
Management Agreement or provide a new management agreement with a new Qualified
Manager which meets with the requirements of Section 5.14 hereof and assign to
Lender as additional security such new management agreement;

            (i) Transferee shall furnish an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
Lender and its counsel (A) that Transferee's formation documents provide for the
matters described in subparagraph (g) above, (B) that the assumption of the Debt
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, and that the Note, the
Mortgage, this Agreement, the assumption agreement and the other Loan Documents
are valid, binding and enforceable against Transferee in accordance with their
terms, (C) that Transferee and any entity which is a controlling stockholder,
member or general partner of Transferee, have been duly organized, and are in
existence and good standing, and (D) with respect to such other matters as
Lender may reasonably request;

            (j) if required by Lender, Lender shall have received confirmation
in writing from the Rating Agencies that rate the Securities to the effect that
the transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any
rating initially assigned or to be assigned to the Securities;

            (k) Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale pursuant to
which the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject to the
satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Section 7.5;

            (l) Transferee shall, prior to such transfer, deliver a substantive
non-consolidation opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope and
substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies;

            (m) In connection with an assumption of the Loan, Lender shall
release the Property and the Loan from any cross collateralization and cross
default provisions contained the other Loan Documents; and

            (n) Lender shall have determined that the Debt Service Coverage
Ratio with respect to each of (i) the Property and (ii) the Crossed Properties
after giving effect to the assumption (assuming a loan amount equal to the
principal balance of the Note which is not being assumed immediately following
the subject assumption) shall be at least equal to 1.275 to 1.0 for the twelve
(12) full calendar months immediately preceding the assumption of the Loan.


                                      -58-
<PAGE>
            A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of the Property in
its entirety or one hundred percent (100%) of the ownership interests in
Borrower to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, a Transferee pursuant to
this Section 7.5 shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of Lender to
consent to any subsequent Sale of Pledge of the Property.

            SECTION 7.6. EASEMENTS; LICENSES.

            Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary herein, Borrower
may grant easements, covenants, reservations and rights of way with respect to
the Property in the ordinary course of business for utilities, ingress and
egress and other similar purposes provided such grants, transfers, conveyances
or easements (i) do not impair the utility or operation of the Property,
materially adversely effect the value of Property or adversely affect Borrower's
ability to repay the Loan and (ii) shall be in form reasonably acceptable to
Lender, and, in such case, Lender shall subordinate the Lien of the Security
Instrument to such grant, easement, transfer or conveyance.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                 INSURANCE; CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION; RESTORATION

            SECTION 8.1. INSURANCE

            (a) Borrower shall obtain and maintain, or cause to be maintained,

following coverages:

            (i) comprehensive "all risk" insurance on the Improvements and the
      Personal Property, in each case (A) in an amount equal to one hundred
      percent (100%) of the "Full Replacement Cost," which for purposes of this
      Agreement shall mean actual replacement value (exclusive of costs of
      excavations, foundations, underground utilities and footings) with a
      waiver of depreciation; (B) containing an agreed amount endorsement with
      respect to the Improvements and Personal Property waiving all co-insurance
      provisions; (C) providing for no deductible in excess of $100,000 for all
      such insurance coverage; and (D) if any of the Improvements or the use of
      the Property shall at any time constitute legal non-conforming structures
      or uses, providing coverage for contingent liability from Operation of
      Building Laws, Demolition Costs and Increased Cost of Construction
      Endorsements and containing an "Ordinance or Law Coverage" or
      "Enforcement" endorsement. In addition, Borrower shall obtain: (y) if any
      portion of the Improvements (it being understood that for purposes of this
      clause (y) only, Improvements shall only mean that portion of the
      Improvements consisting of a clubhouse or community center) is currently
      or at any time in the future located in a "special flood hazard area"
      designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, flood hazard
      insurance in an amount equal to the maximum amount of such insurance

      required under this subsection (i);


                                      -59-
<PAGE>
            (ii) Commercial General Liability insurance against claims for
      personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring upon,
      in or about the Property, with such insurance (A) to be on the so-called

      Improvements and Personal Property occurs, the loss of rents or income, as
      applicable, will be insured until completion of Restoration or the
      expiration of twelve (12) months, whichever first occurs, and
      notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such
      period; and (D) which contains an extended period of indemnity endorsement
      which provides that after the physical loss to the Improvements and
      Personal Property has been repaired, the continued loss of income will be
      insured until such income either returns to the same level it was at prior
      to the loss, or the expiration of six (6) months from the date that the
      Property is repaired or replaced and operations are resumed, whichever
      first occurs, and notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the
      end of such period. The amount of such loss of rents or business income
      insurance, as applicable, shall be determined prior to the date hereof and
      at least once each year thereafter based on Borrower's reasonable estimate
      of the gross income from the Property for the succeeding period of
      coverage required above. All proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to this
      subsection shall be held by Lender and shall be applied to the obligations
      secured by the Loan Documents from time to time due and payable hereunder
      and under the Note; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall
      be deemed to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the obligations
      secured by the Loan Documents on the respective dates of payment provided
      for in the Note, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents except to the
      extent such amounts are actually paid out of the proceeds of such loss of

      Property, and (4) with an agreed amount endorsement waiving co-insurance
      provisions;

            (v) workers' compensation, subject to the statutory limits of the
      State, and employer's liability insurance in respect of any work or
      operations on or about the Property, or in connection with the Property or

      income policy required under subsection (iii) above; provided such
      coverage shall not be in an amount less than $5,000,000.00; provided,
      further, Borrower shall only be required to maintain such terrorism
      insurance (and in no way limiting the coverage for the all risk insurance
      except as such coverage relates to perils resulting from terrorism) equal
      to the lesser of (A) the amount of coverage Borrower is required to
      maintain pursuant to this clause (viii) or (B) in the event that terrorism
      coverage is not available at commercially reasonable rates at any time,
      then the maximum amount of coverage that Borrower can obtain by paying an
      annual premium in the amount of 200% of the portion of the Borrower's
      insurance premiums allocable to terrorism insurance coverage as of the
      date hereof.

            (ix) upon sixty (60) days' written notice, such other reasonable
      insurance and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time to time may
      reasonably request against such other insurable hazards which at the time
      are commonly insured against for property similar to the Property located
      in or around the region in which the Property is located.

            (b) All insurance provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall be obtained
under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "POLICIES" or in the
singular, the "POLICY"), and shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
Lender as to insurance companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and
insureds. The Policies shall be issued by financially sound and responsible
insurance companies authorized to do business in the State and having (i) with
respect to the primary layer(s) of coverage (which shall not be less than
$5,000,000.00) a claims paying ability rating of "A" or better by S&P or such
other Rating Agency approved by Lender, and (ii) with respect to additional
layers of coverage, a claims paying ability rating of "A" or better by S&P or
such other Rating Agency approved by Lender. To the extent such Policies are not
available as of the Closing Date, Borrower shall deliver certified copies of all
Policies to Lender not later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. Not
less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration dates of the Policies
theretofore furnished to Lender, renewal Policies accompanied by evidence
satisfactory to Lender of payment of the premiums due thereunder (the "INSURANCE
PREMIUMS") shall be delivered by Borrower to Lender.

            (c) Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to the
Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder and shall
otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring only
the Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 8.1(a).


                                      -61-
<PAGE>
            (d) All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 8.1(a),
except for the Policy referenced in Section 8.1(a)(v), shall name Borrower as
the insured and Lender as the additional insured, as its interests may appear,
and in the case of property damage, equipment breakdown, flood and earthquake
insurance, shall contain a so-called New York standard non-contributing
mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss thereunder shall be
payable to Lender.

            (e) All Policies provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall contain
clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

            (i) no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for Borrower,
      or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply with the
      provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of
      the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or
      enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is concerned;

            (ii) the Policies shall not be materially changed (other than to
      increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at least
      thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lender and any other party named
      therein as an additional insured;

            (iii) the issuers thereof shall give written notice to Lender if the
      Policies have not been renewed thirty (30) days prior to its expiration;
      and

            (iv) Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums thereon
      or subject to any assessments thereunder.

            (f) If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that
all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have
the right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Property, including, without
limitation, obtaining such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion
deems appropriate. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such
action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the Mortgage
and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

            SECTION 8.2. CASUALTY

            If the Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part,
by fire or other casualty (a "CASUALTY"), Borrower shall give prompt notice of
such damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the
Restoration of the Property in accordance with Section 8.4, provided Lender
makes the Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section 8.4. Borrower shall pay all
costs of such Restoration to the extent such costs are not covered by insurance.
Lender may, but shall not be obligated to make proof of loss if not made timely
by Borrower. Borrower shall adjust all claims for Insurance Proceeds in
consultation with, and approval of, Lender; provided, however, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall have the exclusive right to
participate in the adjustment of all claims for Insurance Proceeds.

            SECTION 8.3. CONDEMNATION

            Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or
threatened commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of the Property
of which Borrower has knowledge and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and
all papers served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in
any such proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its
expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including but not
limited to any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt
shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and
applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the
reduction or discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest
paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive
out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note.
If the Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority,
Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the
Property and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 8.4, provided
Lender makes the Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section 8.4. If the Property
is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by Lender of the
Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the
Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a
portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

            SECTION 8.4. RESTORATION

            The following provisions shall apply in connection with the
Restoration of the Property:

            (a) If the Net Proceeds shall be less than $250,000 and the costs of
completing the Restoration shall be less than $250,000, the Net Proceeds will be
disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i) are met (except for Section
8.1(b)(i)(J)) and Borrower delivers to Lender a written undertaking to
expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily complete with due diligence the
Restoration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,
with respect to the budget delivered to Lender pursuant to Section 8.4(b)(i)(I),
such budget is not subject to the prior approval of Lender.

            (b) If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than $250,000 or the
costs of completing the Restoration are equal to or greater than $250,000,
Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.4. The term "NET PROCEEDS" for purposes of
this Section 8.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance proceeds
received by Lender pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), (iv), (vi) and (viii) as a
result of a Casualty, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("INSURANCE PROCEEDS"), or (ii) the net amount of the Award as a result
of a Condemnation, after deduction of its reasonable


                                      -63-
<PAGE>
costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if
any, in collecting the same ("CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS"), whichever the case may
be.

            (i) The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower for
      Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                  (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

                  (B) No later than the date the insurance described in Section
            8.1(a)(iii) hereof expires or would expire, Tenants under Leases
            covering in the aggregate at least fifty percent (50%) of the total
            rentable space in the Property which has been demised under executed
            and delivered Leases in effect as of the date of the occurrence of
            such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be shall
            remain in full force and effect during and after the completion of
            the Restoration;

                  (C) Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon as
            reasonably practicable (but in no event later than sixty (60) days
            after such Casualty or Condemnation or thirty (30) days after
            adjustment of the Net Proceeds, whichever is later, whichever the
            case may be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to
            satisfactory completion;

                  (D) Lender shall be satisfied that any operating deficits,
            including all scheduled payments of principal and interest under the
            Note, which will be incurred with respect to the Property as a
            result of the occurrence of any such Casualty or Condemnation,
            whichever the case may be, will be covered out of the insurance
            coverage referred to in Section 8.1(a)(iii) above or funds provided
            by the Borrower;

                  (E) Lender shall be satisfied that the Restoration will be
            completed on or before the earliest to occur of (1) six (6) months
            prior to the Maturity Date, (2) such time as may be required under
            applicable zoning law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or (3) the
            expiration of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
            8.1(a)(iii) unless Borrower Principal agrees to make capital
            contributions to Borrower which are sufficient to make any payments
            to Lender pursuant to the terms hereof;

                  (F) the Property and the use thereof after the Restoration
            will be in compliance with and permitted under all Legal
            Requirements;

                  (G) the Restoration shall be done and completed by Borrower in
            an expeditious and diligent fashion and in substantial compliance
            with all applicable Legal Requirements;

                  (H) such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable, does not
            result in the loss of access to the Property or the Improvements;

                  (I) Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
            Lender a signed detailed budget approved in writing by Borrower's
            architect or engineer stating


                                      -64-
<PAGE>
            the entire cost of completing the Restoration, which budget shall be
            reasonably acceptable to Lender; and

                  (J) the Net Proceeds together with any cash or cash equivalent
            deposited by Borrower with Lender are sufficient in Lender's
            reasonable judgment to cover the cost of the Restoration.

            (ii) The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender until disbursements
      commence, and, until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this
      Section 8.4, shall constitute additional security for the Debt and other
      obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be disbursed
      by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower from time to time during the
      course of the Restoration, upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to Lender
      that (A) all the conditions precedent to such advance, including those set
      forth in Section 8.4(b)(i), have been satisfied, (B) all materials
      installed and work and labor performed (except to the extent that they are
      to be paid for out of the requested disbursement) in connection with the
      related Restoration item have been paid for in full, and (C) there exist
      no notices of pendency, stop orders, mechanic's or materialman's liens or
      notices of intention to file same, or any other liens or encumbrances of
      any nature whatsoever on the Property which have not either been fully
      bonded to the satisfaction of Lender and discharged of record or in the
      alternative fully insured to the satisfaction of Lender by the title
      company issuing the Title Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
      Insurance Proceeds from the Policies required to be maintained by Borrower
      pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii) shall be controlled by Lender at all
      times, shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.4 and
      shall be used solely for the payment of the obligations under the Loan
      Documents and Operating Expenses.

            (iii) All plans and specifications required in connection with a
      Restoration in excess of $250,000 shall be subject to prior review and
      reasonable acceptance in all respects by Lender and by an independent
      consulting engineer selected by Lender (the "RESTORATION CONSULTANT").
      Lender shall have the use of the plans and specifications and all permits,
      licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection with the
      Restoration. The identity of the contractors, subcontractors and
      materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as the contracts in excess
      of $50,000 under which they have been engaged, shall be subject to prior
      review and reasonable acceptance by Lender and the Restoration Consultant.
      All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with making the
      Net Proceeds available for the Restoration, including, without limitation,
      reasonable counsel fees and disbursements and the Restoration Consultant's
      fees, shall be paid by Borrower.

            (iv) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of
      the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually
      incurred from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration,
      as certified by the Restoration Consultant, minus the Restoration
      Retainage. The term "RESTORATION RETAINAGE" shall mean an amount equal to
      ten percent (10%) of the costs actually incurred for work in place as part
      of the Restoration, as certified by the Restoration Consultant, until the
      Restoration has been completed. The Restoration Retainage shall be reduced
      to five percent (5%) of the costs incurred upon receipt by Lender of
      satisfactory evidence that fifty percent (50%) of the


                                      -65-
<PAGE>
      Restoration has been completed. The Restoration Retainage shall in no
      event, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above in
      this Section 8.4(b), be less than the amount actually held back by
      Borrower from contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the
      Restoration. The Restoration Retainage shall not be released until the
      Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
      completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b) and
      that all approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the Property
      have been obtained from all appropriate Governmental Authorities, and
      Lender receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the
      Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the
      Restoration Retainage; provided, however, that Lender will release the
      portion of the Restoration Retainage being held with respect to any
      contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as of
      the date upon which the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender that
      the contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily completed
      all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with the provisions
      of the contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's contract, the
      contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the lien waivers and
      evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the contractor,
      subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested by Lender or
      by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy, and Lender
      receives an endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy insuring the
      continued priority of the lien of the Mortgage and evidence of payment of
      any premium payable for such endorsement. If required by Lender, the
      release of any such portion of the Restoration Retainage shall be approved
      by the surety company, if any, which has issued a payment or performance
      bond with respect to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman.

            (v) Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net
      Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

            (vi) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance
      thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender in consultation
      with the Restoration Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance
      of the costs which are estimated by the Restoration Consultant to be
      incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower
      shall deposit the deficiency (the "NET PROCEEDS DEFICIENCY") with Lender
      before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made. The Net
      Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be held by Lender and
      shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with the
      Restoration on the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the
      Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) shall
      constitute additional security for the Debt and other obligations under
      the Loan Documents.

            (vii) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining
      balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender
      after the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration
      has been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section
      8.4(b), and the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that
      all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in
      full, shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of
      Default shall have


                                      -66-
<PAGE>
      occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this Agreement or any of
      the other Loan Documents.

            (c) All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 8.4(b)(vii) may (x) be retained and applied by Lender toward the
payment of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority
and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, (y) at
the sole discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part,
to Borrower for such purposes and upon such conditions as Lender shall
designate.

            (d) In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage, or other transfer
of title to the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt, all
right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies then in force
concerning the Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest
in the purchaser at such foreclosure, Lender or other transferee in the event of
such other transfer of title.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  RESERVE FUNDS

            SECTION 9.1. REQUIRED REPAIRS

            (a) Borrower shall make the repairs and improvements to the Property
set forth on Schedule I and as more particularly described in the Physical
Conditions Report prepared in connection with the closing of the Loan (such
repairs hereinafter referred to as "REQUIRED REPAIRS"). Borrower shall complete
the Required Repairs in a good and workmanlike manner on or before the date that
is twelve (12) months from the date hereof or within such other time frame for
completion specifically set forth on Schedule I.

            (b) Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an account with
Lender or Lender's agent to fund the Required Repairs (the "REQUIRED REPAIR
ACCOUNT") into which Borrower shall deposit on the date hereof the amount of
$0.00. Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the "REQUIRED
REPAIR FUNDS".

            SECTION 9.2. REPLACEMENTS

            (a) On an ongoing basis throughout the term of the Loan, Borrower
shall make capital repairs, replacements and improvements necessary to keep the
Property in good order and repair and in a good marketable condition or prevent
deterioration of the Property (collectively, the "REPLACEMENTS"). Borrower shall
complete all Replacements in a good and workmanlike manner as soon as
commercially reasonable after commencing to make each such Replacement.

            (b) Upon the commencement of a Reserve DSCR Period Borrower shall
establish an Eligible Account with Lender or Lender's agent to fund the
Replacements (the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE ACCOUNT"). Borrower shall deposit, during
the continuance of a Reserve DSCR Period, one-twelfth (1/12) of the sum $50.00
per pad site on the Property (the "Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit") into
the Replacement Reserve Account on each


                                      -67-
<PAGE>
Scheduled Payment Date. Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as
"Replacement Reserve Funds".

            SECTION 9.3. INTENTIONALLY RESERVED

            SECTION 9.4. REQUIRED WORK

            Borrower shall diligently pursue all Required Repairs and
Replacements (collectively, the "Required Work") to completion in accordance
with the following requirements:

            (a) Lender reserves the right, at its option, to approve all
contracts or work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors,
contractors or other parties providing labor or materials in connection with the
Required Work to the extent such contracts or work orders exceed $50,000, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Upon
Lender's request, Borrower shall assign any contract or subcontract to Lender.

            (b) In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that
any Required Repair is not being or has not been performed in a workmanlike or
timely manner (consistent with the time deadlines provided herein). Upon written
notice to Borrower and Borrower's failure to commence performance thereof within
thirty (30) days, weather permitting, Lender shall have the option to withhold
disbursement for such unsatisfactory Required Repairs and to proceed under
existing contracts or to contract with third parties to complete such Required
Repairs and to apply the Required Repair Funds, toward the labor and materials
necessary to complete such Required Repairs and to exercise any and all other
remedies available to Lender upon an Event of Default hereunder.

            (c) In order to facilitate Lender's completion of the Required
Repair, effective only when Lender has the right to exercise its rights under
Section 9.4(b), Borrower grants Lender the right to enter onto the Property and
perform any and all work and labor necessary to complete Required Work and/or
employ watchmen to protect the Property from damage. All sums so expended by
Lender, to the extent not from the Reserve Funds, shall be deemed to have been
advanced under the Loan to Borrower and secured by the Mortgage. For this
purpose and subject to the limitations contained in the first sentence of this
Section 9.4(c), Borrower constitutes and appoints Lender its true and lawful
attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to complete or undertake the
Required Repair in the name of Borrower upon Borrower's failure to do so in a
workmanlike and timely manner. Such power of attorney shall be deemed to be a
power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. Borrower empowers said
attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any of the Reserve Funds for the purpose
of making or completing the Required Repair; (ii) to make such additions,
changes and corrections to the Required Repair as shall be necessary or
desirable to complete the Required Repair as set forth herein and the schedules
hereto; (iii) to employ or retain such contractors, subcontractors, agents,
architects and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes at commercially
reasonable prices to the extent such work is not being performed by contractors
or subcontractors retained by Borrower; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all
existing bills and claims which are or may become Liens against the Property, or
as may be necessary or desirable for the completion of the Required Repair, or
for clearance of title; (v) to execute all applications and certificates in the


                                      -68-
<PAGE>
name of Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to
prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Property
or the rehabilitation and repair of the Property; and (vii) to do any and every
act which Borrower might do on its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this
Section 9.4.

            (d) Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall: (i) make Lender responsible
for making or completing the Required Repair; (ii) require Lender to expend
funds in addition to the Reserve Funds to make or complete any Required Repair;
(iii) obligate Lender to proceed with the Required Repair; or (iv) obligate
Lender to demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Required
Repair.

            (e) Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or
inspector) or third parties performing Required Repair pursuant to this Section
9.4 to enter onto the Property upon reasonable advance notice during normal
business hours (subject to the rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect
the progress of any Required Repair and all materials being used in connection
therewith, to examine all plans and shop drawings relating to such Required
Repair which are or may be kept at the Property, and to complete any Required
Repair made pursuant to this Section 9.4. Borrower shall cause all contractors
and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender and Lender's representatives or such
other persons described above in connection with inspections described in this
Section 9.4 or the completion of Required Repair pursuant to this Section 9.4.

            (f) Lender may, to the extent any Required Work would reasonably
require an inspection of the Property, inspect the Property at Borrower's
expense prior to making a disbursement of the Reserve Funds in order to verify
completion of the Required Work for which reimbursement is sought. If Borrower
has reserved any amounts for such Required Repair pursuant to Section 9.1
hereof, Borrower shall pay Lender a reasonable inspection fee not exceeding
$500.00 for each such inspection. Lender may require that such inspection be
conducted by an appropriate independent qualified professional selected by
Lender and/or may require a copy of a certificate of completion by an
independent qualified professional acceptable to Lender prior to the
disbursement of the Reserve Funds. Borrower shall pay the expense of the
inspection as required hereunder, whether such inspection is conducted by Lender
or by an independent qualified professional.

            (g) The Required Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or any
other item comprising a part of any Required Work shall be constructed,
installed or completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's,
materialman's or other Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

            (h) Before each disbursement of the Reserve Funds in excess of
$50,000, Lender may require Borrower to provide Lender with a search of title to
the Property effective to the date of the disbursement, which search shows that
no mechanic's or materialmen's or other Liens of any nature have been placed
against the Property since the date of recordation of the Mortgage and that
title to the Property is free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted
Encumbrances).

            (i) All Required Work shall comply with all Legal Requirements and
applicable insurance requirements including, without limitation, applicable
building codes, special use permits, environmental regulations, and requirements
of insurance underwriters.

            (j) Borrower hereby assigns to Lender all rights and claims Borrower
may have against all Persons supplying labor or materials in connection with the
Required Work; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such rights or
claims unless an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured.

            SECTION 9.5. RELEASE OF RESERVE FUNDS

            (a) Upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction of the
requirements set forth in this Agreement, Lender shall disburse to Borrower
amounts from (i) the Required Repair Account to the extent necessary to
reimburse Borrower for the actual costs of each Required Repair (but not
exceeding 125% of the original estimated cost of such Required Repair as set
forth on Schedule I, unless Lender has agreed to reimburse Borrower for such
excess cost pursuant to Section 9.5(f)) or (ii) the Replacement Reserve Account
to the extent necessary to reimburse Borrower for the actual costs of any
approved Replacements. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall
Lender be required to (x) disburse any amounts which would cause the amount of
funds remaining in the Required Repair Account after any disbursement (other
than with respect to the final disbursement) to be less than 125% of the then
current estimated cost of completing all remaining Required Repairs for the
Property, (y) disburse funds from any of the Reserve Accounts if an Event of
Default exists, or (z) disburse funds from the Replacement Reserve Account to
reimburse Borrower for the costs of routine repairs or maintenance to the
Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed from funds held in the Required
Repair Account.

            (b) Each request for disbursement from any of the Reserve Accounts
shall be on a form provided or approved by Lender and shall (i) include copies
of invoices for all items or materials purchased and all labor or services
provided and (ii) specify (A) the Required Work for which the disbursement is
requested, (B) the quantity and price of each item purchased, if the Required
Work includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (C) the price of
all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any Required Work other than
the purchase or replacement of specific items, and (D) the cost of all
contracted labor or other services applicable to each Required Work for which
such request for disbursement is made. With each request Borrower shall certify
that all Required Work has been performed in accordance with all Legal
Requirements. Except as provided in Section 9.5(d), each request for
disbursement shall be made only after completion of the Required Repair or
Replacement (or the portion thereof completed in accordance with Section
9.5(d)), as applicable, for which disbursement is requested. Borrower shall
provide Lender evidence satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable judgment of
such completion or performance.

            (c) Borrower shall pay all invoices in connection with the Required
Work with respect to which a disbursement is requested prior to submitting such
request for disbursement from the Reserve Accounts or, at the request of
Borrower, Lender will issue joint checks, payable to Borrower and the
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic, subcontractor or other party to
whom payment is due in connection with the Required Work. In the case of


                                      -70-
<PAGE>
payments made by joint check, Lender may require a waiver of lien from each
Person receiving payment prior to Lender's disbursement of the Reserve Funds. In
addition, as a condition to any disbursement, Lender may require Borrower to
obtain lien waivers from each contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic or
subcontractor who receives payment in an amount equal to or greater than $50,000
for completion of its work or delivery of its materials. Any lien waiver
delivered hereunder shall conform to all Legal Requirements and shall cover all
work performed and materials supplied (including equipment and fixtures) for the
Property by that contractor, supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman
through the date covered by the current disbursement request (or, in the event
that payment to such contractor, supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or
materialmen is to be made by a joint check, the release of lien shall be
effective through the date covered by the previous release of funds request).

            (d) If (i) the cost of any item of Required Work exceeds $50,000,
(ii) the contractor performing such Required Work requires periodic payments
pursuant to terms of a written contract, and (iii) Lender has approved in
writing in advance such periodic payments (provided, Lender shall not be
entitled to approve the contract if Lender has already approved such contract
pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.4(a)), a request for disbursement from
the Reserve Accounts may be made after completion of a portion of the work under
such contract, provided (A) such contract requires payment upon completion of
such portion of work, (B) the materials for which the request is made are on
site at the Property and are properly secured or have been installed in the
Property, and (C) all other conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have
been satisfied.

            (e) Borrower shall not make a request for, nor shall Lender have any
obligation to make, any disbursement from any Reserve Account more frequently
than once in any calendar month and (except in connection with the final
disbursement) in any amount less than the lesser of (i) $10,000 or (ii) the
total cost of the Required Work for which the disbursement is requested.

            (f) In the event any Borrower requests a disbursement from the
Required Repair Account to reimburse Borrower for the actual cost of labor or
materials used in connection with repairs or improvements other than the
Required Repairs specified on Schedule I, or for a Required Repair to the extent
the cost of such Required Repair exceeds 125% of the estimated cost of such
Required Repair as set forth on Schedule I (in either case, an "ADDITIONAL
REQUIRED REPAIR"), Borrower shall disclose in writing to Lender the reason why
funds in the Required Repair Account should be used to pay for such Additional
Required Repair. If Lender determines that (i) such Additional Required Repair
is of the type intended to be covered by the Required Repair Account, (ii) costs
for such Additional Required Repair are reasonable, (iii) the funds in the
Required Repair Account are sufficient to pay for such Additional Required
Repair and all other Required Repairs for the Property specified on Schedule I,
(iv) such Additional Required Repair is not covered or is not of the type
intended to be covered by the Replacement Reserve Account, and (v) all other
conditions for disbursement under this Agreement have been met, Lender may
disburse funds from the Required Repair Account.

            (g) Intentionally reserved.


                                      -71-
<PAGE>
            (h) Lender's disbursement of any Reserve Funds or other
acknowledgment of completion of any Required Work in a manner satisfactory to
Lender shall not be deemed a certification or warranty by Lender to any Person
that the Required Work has been completed in accordance with Legal Requirements.

            (i) If the funds in any Reserve Account should exceed the amount of
payments actually applied by Lender for the purposes of the account, Lender
shall return any excess to Borrower, unless at the time Borrower is required to
make future payments to the Reserve Account, in which case Lender may, in its
discretion, credit such excess against future payments to be made to that
Reserve Account. In allocating any such excess, Lender may deal with the Person
shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the Property. If at any time
Lender reasonably determines that the Reserve Funds are not or will not be
sufficient to make the required payments, Lender shall notify Borrower of such
determination and Borrower shall pay to Lender any amount necessary to make up
the deficiency within ten (10) days after notice from Lender to Borrower
requesting payment thereof.

            (j) The insufficiency of any balance in any of the Reserve Accounts
shall not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill all preservation and
maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.

            (k) Upon the earlier to occur of (i) the timely completion of all
Required Repairs and any Additional Required Repairs, if any, in accordance with
the requirements of this Agreement, as verified by Lender in its reasonable
discretion, or (ii) the payment in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on
deposit, if any, in the Required Repair Account shall be returned to Borrower or
the Person shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the Property and no
other party shall have any right or claim thereto.

            (l) Upon payment in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on
deposit, if any, in the Replacement Reserve Account shall be returned to
Borrower or the Person shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the
Property and no other party shall have any right or claim thereto.

            SECTION 9.6. TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS

            Upon the commencement of a Reserve DSCR Period Borrower shall
establish an account with Lender or Lender's agent sufficient to discharge
Borrower's obligations for the payment of Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant
to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof (the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNT"),
which amount, when added to the required monthly deposits set forth in the next
sentence, is sufficient to make the payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums as
required herein. Borrower shall deposit into the Tax and Insurance Reserve
Account on each Scheduled Payment Date (a) one-twelfth of the Taxes that Lender
estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months or such
higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all
such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to the earlier of (i) the date that
the same will become delinquent and (ii) the date that additional charges or
interest will accrue due to the non-payment thereof, and (b) except to the
extent Lender has waived the insurance escrow because the insurance required
hereunder is maintained under a blanket insurance Policy acceptable to Lender in
accordance with Section 8.1(c), one-


                                      -72-
<PAGE>
twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that Lender estimates will be payable during
the next ensuing twelve (12) months for the renewal of the coverage afforded by
the Policies upon the expiration thereof or such higher amount necessary to
accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance Premiums at
least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Policies (said amounts in
(a) and (b) above hereinafter called the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS").
Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds to payments of Taxes and
Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Section 5.4 and
Section 8.1 hereof. In making any disbursement from the Tax and Insurance
Reserve Account, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate
procured from the appropriate public office or tax lien service (with respect to
Taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry
into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of
any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If
the amount of the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds shall exceed the amounts due
for Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof,
Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit
such excess against future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Reserve
Account. In allocating any such excess, Lender may deal with the person shown on
Lender's records as being the owner of the Property. Any amount remaining in the
Tax and Insurance Reserve Account after the Debt has been paid in full shall be
returned to Borrower or the person shown on Lender's records as being the owner
of the Property and no other party shall have any right or claim thereto. If at
any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds
are not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the
dates set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such
determination and Borrower shall pay to Lender any amount necessary to make up
the deficiency within ten (10) days after notice from Lender to Borrower
requesting payment thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as (x)
Borrower is maintaining all or a portion of the insurance required under Section
8.1 through a blanket insurance policy in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof, including, but not limited to, Section 8.1(c) hereof and such
blanket policy is acceptable to Lender, (y) no Event of Default exists and (z)
Borrower provides Lender with evidence in form and substance satisfactory to
Lender of the annual renewal of such blanket insurance policy, Borrower shall
not be required to escrow for Insurance Premiums as set forth in this Section
9.6 for that portion of the insurance required under Section 8.1 which is
covered by the blanket insurance policy in accordance with the terms hereof. In
the event that, at any time, a blanket insurance policy is not in effect in
accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, Borrower shall immediately
provide for either (i) an individual policy for the Property complying with the
terms and conditions set forth herein and shall immediately commence making
deposits for Insurance Premiums in accordance with this Section 9.6 or (ii) a
replacement blanket policy complying with the terms and conditions set forth
herein and acceptable to Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall
not be required to make monthly deposits for Taxes pursuant to cause (a) above,
unless a Reserve DSCR Period is continuing; provided, however, in the event a
Reserve DSCR Period is continuing, in lieu of making the monthly deposits
required pursuant to clause (a) above, Borrower may elect to deliver to Lender,
within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of a Reserve DSCR Period, a
Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the Taxes that Lender estimates will be
payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months. Borrower shall give Lender
no less than five (5) Business days notice of Borrower's election to deliver a
Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 9.6 and Borrower shall pay to Lender
all of Lender's reasonable out-of-pocket costs and


                                      -73-
<PAGE>
expenses in connection therewith. Borrower shall not be entitled to draw from
any such Letter of Credit. Upon thirty (30) days notice to Lender, Borrower may
replace a Letter of Credit with a cash deposit to the Tax and Insurance Reserve
Fund if a Letter of Credit has been outstanding for more than six (6) months.
Prior to the return of a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall deposit an amount
equal to the amount that would have accumulated in the Tax and Insurance Reserve
Fund and not been disbursed in accordance with this Agreement if such Letter of
Credit had not been delivered. Borrower shall provide Lender with notice of any
increases in the annual payments for Taxes thirty (30) days prior to the
effective date of any such increase and any applicable Letter of Credit shall be
increased by such increased amount at least ten (10) days prior to the effective
date of such increase. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, upon the discontinuance of a Reserve DSCR Period, Lender shall
release to Borrower any Letter of Credit delivered to Lender pursuant to this
Section 9.6 or return to Borrower all funds in the Tax and Insurance Reserve
Account.

            SECTION 9.7. INTENTIONALLY RESERVED

            SECTION 9.8. INTENTIONALLY RESERVED

            SECTION 9.9. LETTERS OF CREDIT

            (a) Each Letter of Credit delivered under this Agreement shall be
additional security for the payment of the Debt. Upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default, Lender shall have the right, at its option, to draw on any Letter of
Credit and to apply all or any part thereof to the payment of the items for
which such Letter of Credit was established or to apply each such Letter of
Credit to payment of the Debt in such order, proportion or priority as Lender
may determine. Any such application to the Debt shall be subject to the
prepayment premium set forth in Section 2.4(c) hereof.

            (b) In addition to any other right Lender may have to draw upon a
Letter of Credit pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Lender
shall have the additional rights to draw in full any Letter of Credit: (i) with
respect to any evergreen Letter of Credit, if Lender has received a notice from
the issuing bank that the Letter of Credit will not be renewed and a substitute
Letter of Credit is not provided at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on
which the outstanding Letter of Credit is scheduled to expire; (ii) with respect
to any Letter of Credit with a stated expiration date, if Lender has not
received a notice from the issuing bank that it has renewed the Letter of Credit
at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Letter of Credit is
scheduled to expire and a substitute Letter of Credit is not provided at least
thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the outstanding Letter of Credit is
scheduled to expire; (iii) upon receipt of notice from the issuing bank that the
Letter of Credit will be terminated (except if the termination of such Letter of
Credit is permitted pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or a
substitute Letter of Credit is provided); or (iv) if Lender has received notice
that the bank issuing the Letter of Credit shall cease to be an Eligible
Institution; provided, however, so long as no Event of Default is continuing,
any funds resulting from draw made by Lender pursuant to the provisions of
clauses (i) - (iv) above shall be deposited into the Reserve Account for which
Borrower delivered such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the above, Lender is not obligated to draw any Letter of
Credit upon the happening of an event specified in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)
above and shall not be liable for any losses sustained


                                      -74-
<PAGE>
by Borrower due to the insolvency of the bank issuing the Letter of Credit if
Lender has not drawn the Letter of Credit.

            SECTION 9.10. RESERVE FUNDS GENERALLY

            (a) (i) Except for the Required Repair Account and the Replacement
Reserve Account, no earnings or interest on the Reserve Accounts shall be
payable to Borrower. Neither Lender nor any loan servicer that at any time holds
or maintains such non-interest-bearing Reserve Accounts such Reserve Accounts or
any funds deposited therein in interest-bearing accounts. If Lender or any such
loan servicer elects in its sole and absolute discretion to keep or maintain any
non-interest-bearing Reserve Account or any funds deposited therein in an
interest-bearing account, the account shall be an Eligible Account and (A) such
funds shall not be invested except in Permitted Investments, and (B) all
interest earned or accrued thereon shall be for the account of and be retained
by Lender or such loan servicer.

            (ii) Funds deposited in the Required Repair Account and the
      Replacement Reserve Account shall be held in an interest-bearing business
      savings account and interest shall be credited to Borrower. In no event
      shall Lender or any loan servicer that at any time holds or maintains the
      Required Repair Account or Replacement Reserve Account, as applicable, be
      required to select any particular interest-bearing account or the account
      that yields the highest rate of interest, provided that selection of the
      account shall be consistent with the general standards at the time being
      utilized by Lender or the loan servicer, as applicable, in establishing
      similar accounts for loans of comparable type. All such interest shall be
      and become part of the Required Repair Account and the Replacement Reserve
      Account, as applicable, and shall be disbursed in accordance with Section
      9.5 above; provided, however, that Lender may, at its election, retain any
      such interest for its own account during the occurrence and continuance of
      an Event of Default. Borrower agrees that it shall include all interest on
      Required Repair Funds and Replacement Reserve Funds as the income of
      Borrower (and, if Borrower is a partnership or other pass-through entity,
      the partners, members or beneficiaries of Borrower, as the case may be),
      and shall be the owner of the Required Repair Funds and Replacement
      Reserve Funds for federal and applicable state and local tax purposes,
      except to the extent that Lender retains any interest for its own account
      during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default as provided
      herein.

            (b) Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security
interest in, and assigns and pledges to Lender all Reserve Funds now or
hereafter deposited in the related Reserve Accounts as additional security for
payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in accordance herewith, the
Reserve Accounts and the Reserve Funds shall constitute additional security for
the Debt. The provisions of this Section 9.10 are intended to give Lender or any
subsequent holder of the Loan "control" of the Reserve Accounts within the
meaning of the UCC.

            (c) The Reserve Accounts and any and all Reserve Funds now or
hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts shall be subject to the exclusive
dominion and control of Lender, which shall hold the Reserve Accounts and any or
all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.


                                      -75-
<PAGE>
Borrower shall have no right of withdrawal from the Reserve Accounts or any
other right or power with respect to the Reserve Accounts or any or all of the
Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement.

            (d) Lender shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Borrower,
without charge, a quarterly accounting of each Reserve Account in the normal
format of Lender or its loan servicer, showing credits and debits to such
Reserve Account, if any, and the purpose for which each debit to each Reserve
Account was made, if any.

            (e) As long as no Event of Default has occurred, Lender shall make
disbursements from the Reserve Accounts in accordance with this Agreement. All
such disbursements shall be deemed to have been expressly pre-authorized by
Borrower, and shall not be deemed to constitute the exercise by Lender of any
remedies against Borrower unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and Lender has expressly stated in writing its intent to proceed to
exercise its remedies as a secured party, pledgee or lienholder with respect to
the Reserve Accounts.

            (f) If any Event of Default occurs, Borrower shall immediately lose
all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve Accounts until the
earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such Event of Default is cured to
Lender's satisfaction, or (ii) the payment in full of the Debt. In addition, at
Lender's election, Borrower shall lose all of its rights to receive interest on
the Required Repair Account and the Replacement Reserve Account during the
occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default. Upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default, Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies as a
secured party, pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Reserve Accounts.
Without limitation of the foregoing, upon any Event of Default, Lender may use
and disburse the Reserve Funds (or any portion thereof) for any of the following
purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited to, principal
prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or partial
prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses, fees,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment
of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to
Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other
Loan Documents; (D) payment of any item from any of the Reserve Accounts as
required or permitted under this Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted
by applicable law; provided, however, that any such application of funds shall
not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default. Without limiting any other
provisions hereof, each of the remedial actions described in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable exercise of
Lender's rights and remedies as a secured party with respect to the Reserve
Funds and shall not in any event be deemed to constitute a setoff or a
foreclosure of a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve Funds to effect a
cure of any Event of Default, or to pay the Debt, or in any specific order of
priority. The exercise of any or all of Lender's rights and remedies under this
Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents shall not in any way
prejudice or affect Lender's right to initiate and complete a foreclosure under
the Mortgage.

            (g) The Reserve Funds shall not constitute escrow or trust funds and
may be commingled with other monies held by Lender. Notwithstanding anything
else herein to the


                                      -76-
<PAGE>
contrary, Lender may commingle in one or more Eligible Accounts any and all
funds controlled by Lender, including, without limitation, funds pledged in
favor of Lender by other borrowers, whether for the same purposes as the Reserve
Accounts or otherwise. Without limiting any other provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, the Reserve Accounts may be established and held in
such name or names as Lender or its loan servicer, as agent for Lender, shall
deem appropriate, including, without limitation, in the name of Lender or such
loan servicer as agent for Lender. In the case of any Reserve Account which is
held in a commingled account, Lender or its loan servicer, as applicable, shall
maintain records sufficient to enable it to determine at all times which portion
of such account is related to the Loan. Upon assignment of the Loan by Lender,
any Reserve Funds shall be turned over to the assignee and any responsibility of
Lender as assignor shall terminate. The requirements of this Agreement
concerning Reserve Accounts in no way supersede, limit or waive any other rights
or obligations of the parties under any of the Loan Documents or under
applicable law.

            (h) Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent
of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the Reserve
Accounts or the Reserve Funds deposited therein or permit any Lien to attach
thereto, except for the security interest granted in this Section 9.10, or any
levy to be made thereon, or any UCC Financing Statements, except those naming
Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

            (i) Borrower will maintain the security interest created by this
Section 9.10 as a first priority perfected security interest and will defend the
right, title and interest of Lender in and to the Reserve Accounts and the
Reserve Funds against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. At any
time and from time to time, upon the written request of Lender, and at the sole
expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and duly execute and deliver such
further instruments and documents and will take such further actions as Lender
reasonably may request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted.

            (j) Lender shall be protected in acting upon any notice, resolution,
request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other paper,
document or signature believed by Lender to be genuine, and it may be assumed
conclusively that any Person purporting to give any of the foregoing in
connection with the Reserve Accounts has been duly authorized to do so. Lender
may consult with counsel, and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and
complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered
by them hereunder and in good faith in accordance therewith. Lender shall not be
liable to Borrower for any act or omission done or omitted to be done by Lender
in reliance upon any instruction, direction or certification received by Lender
and without gross negligence or willful misconduct.

            (k) Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof,
Lender shall have any duty as to any Reserve Funds in its possession or control
as agent therefor or bailee thereof or any income thereon or the preservation of
rights against any person or otherwise with respect thereto. In no event shall
Lender or its Affiliates, agents, employees or bailees, be liable or responsible
for any loss or damage to any of the Reserve Funds, or for any diminution in
value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of Lender, except to the extent
that such loss or damage results from Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct or intentional nonperformance by Lender of its obligations under this
Agreement.

                                 CASH MANAGEMENT

            SECTION 10.1. PROPERTY OPERATING ACCOUNT

            (a) Borrower acknowledges and confirms that Borrower has
established, and Borrower covenants that it shall maintain a deposit account
with a federally insured financial institution (whether one or more,
individually and collectively, as the case may be, the "PROPERTY OPERATING
ACCOUNT BANK") with respect to the Property into which Borrower shall, and shall
cause Manager to, deposit or cause to be deposited, all Rents and other revenue
from the Property (such account, all funds at any time on deposit therein and
any proceeds, replacements or substitutions of such account or funds therein,
are referred to herein as the "PROPERTY OPERATING ACCOUNT").

SPE Component Entity and their respective principals which are consistent with
the provisions of Article 6;

            (c) at Lender's expense, cause counsel to render or update existing
opinion letters as to enforceability and non-consolidation, which may be relied
upon by the holder of the Note, the Rating Agencies and their respective
counsel, which shall be dated as of the closing date of the Securitization;

            (d) permit site inspections, appraisals, market studies and other
due diligence investigations of the Property, as may be reasonably requested by
the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or as may be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the Securitization all at Lender's expense;

            (e) make the representations and warranties with respect to the
Property, Borrower, Borrower Principal and the Loan Documents as are made in the
Loan Documents;

            (f) execute such amendments to the Loan Documents as may be
reasonably requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or
otherwise to effect the Securitization all at Lender's expense including,
without limitation, bifurcation of the Loan into two or more components and/or
separate notes and/or creating a senior/subordinate note structure; provided,
however, that Borrower shall not be required to modify or amend any Loan
Document if such modification or amendment would (i) change the interest rate,
the stated maturity or the amortization of principal set forth in the Note,
except in connection with a bifurcation of the Loan which may result in varying
fixed interest rates and amortization schedules, but which shall have the same
weighted average coupon of the original Note throughout the entire term of the
Loan, or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of Borrower, modify or amend any other
material economic term of the Loan, or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of
Borrower, materially increase Borrower's obligations and liabilities under the
Loan Documents;

            (g) deliver to Lender and/or any Rating Agency, at Lender's expense,
(i) one or more certificates executed by an officer of the Borrower certifying
as to the accuracy in all material respects, as of the closing date of the
Securitization, of all representations made by Borrower in the Loan Documents as
of the Closing Date in all relevant jurisdictions or, if such


                                      -87-
<PAGE>
representations are no longer accurate, certifying as to what modifications to
the representations would be required to make such representations accurate in
all material respects as of the closing date of the Securitization, and (ii)
certificates of the relevant Governmental Authorities in all relevant
jurisdictions indicating the good standing and qualification of Borrower as of
the date of the closing date of the Securitization;

            (h) have reasonably appropriate personnel participate in a bank
meeting and/or presentation for the Rating Agencies or Investors; and

            (i) cooperate with and assist Lender in obtaining ratings of the
Securities from two (2) or more of the Rating Agencies.

            Except as otherwise provided in this Section 13.4, all reasonable
third party costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in connection with
Borrower's complying with requests made under this Section 13.4 shall be paid by
Borrower, it being acknowledged and agreed that Borrower shall not be obligated
to pay Lender's costs and expenses and the costs and expenses of third parties
engaged by Lender in connection with requests by Lender pursuant to this Section
13.4, unless otherwise provided in this Section 13.4.

            In the event that Borrower requests any consent or approval
hereunder and the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Documents require the
receipt of written confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to the
rating on the Securities, or, in accordance with the terms of the transaction
documents relating to a Securitization, such a rating confirmation is required
in order for the consent of Lender to be given, Borrower shall pay all of the
reasonable costs and expenses of Lender, Lender's servicer and each Rating
Agency in connection therewith, and, if applicable, shall pay any fees imposed
by any Rating Agency as a condition to the delivery of such confirmation.

            SECTION 13.5. SECURITIZATION INDEMNIFICATION

            (a) Borrower and Borrower Principal understand that certain of the
Provided Information may be included in disclosure documents in connection with
the Securitization, including, without limitation, a prospectus, prospectus
supplement, offering memorandum or private placement memorandum (each, a
"DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT") and may also be included in filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or
provided or made available to investors or prospective investors in the
Securities, the Rating Agencies, and service providers relating to the
Securitization. In the event that the Disclosure Document is required to be
revised prior to the sale of all Securities, Borrower and Borrower Principal
will cooperate with the holder of the Note in updating the Disclosure Document
by providing all current information necessary to keep the Disclosure Document
accurate and complete in all material respects, subject to the terms and
conditions contained in Section 13.4.

            (b) Borrower and Borrower Principal agree to provide in connection
with each of (i) a preliminary and a final offering memorandum or private
placement memorandum or similar document (including any Investor or Rating
Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan)
or (ii) a preliminary and final prospectus or prospectus


                                      -88-
<PAGE>
supplement, as applicable, an indemnification certificate (A) certifying that
Borrower and Borrower Principal have carefully examined the specific sections of
any memorandum or prospectus describing or disclosing the Property Information
(which specific sections shall be provided by Lender) which shall only relate to
Borrower, Borrower Principal, Manager, their Affiliates, the Loan, the Loan
Documents and the Property, and that, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, such
sections (and any other sections reasonably requested) do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; provided, however, Borrower shall not make any
representations or warranties concerning the truth, accuracy or completeness of
any information or reports prepared by a third party, (B) indemnifying Lender
(and for purposes of this Section 13.5, Lender hereunder shall include its
officers and directors) and the Affiliate of Lender that (i) has filed the
registration statement, if any, relating to the Securitization and/or (ii) which
is acting as issuer, depositor, sponsor and/or a similar capacity with respect
to the Securitization (any Person described in (i) or (ii), an "ISSUER PERSON"),
and each director and officer of any Issuer Person, and each Person or entity
who controls any Issuer Person within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the "ISSUER
GROUP"), and each Person which is acting as an underwriter, manager, placement
agent, initial purchaser or similar capacity with respect to the Securitization,
each of its directors and officers and each Person who controls any such Person
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the
Exchange Act (collectively, the "UNDERWRITER GROUP") for any Losses to which
Lender, the Issuer Group or the Underwriter Group may become subject insofar as
the Losses directly arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in such sections or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein
a material fact required to be stated in such sections or necessary in order to
make the statements in such sections or in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not materially misleading (collectively the "SECURITIES
LIABILITIES") and (C) agreeing to reimburse Lender, the Issuer Group and the
Underwriter Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by Lender
and Issuer Group in connection with investigating or defending the Securities
Liabilities; provided, however, that Borrower will be liable in any such case
under clauses (B) or (C) above only to the extent that any such Securities
Liabilities arise out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or omission
made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to
Lender or any member of the Issuer Group or Underwriter Group by or on behalf of
Borrower or Borrower Principal in connection with the preparation of the
memorandum or prospectus or other document (including any Investor or Rating
Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan)
or in connection with the underwriting of the Loan, including, without
limitation, financial statements of Borrower or Borrower Principal, operating
statements, rent rolls, environmental site assessment reports and Property
condition reports with respect to the Property. This indemnity agreement will be
in addition to any liability which Borrower and Borrower Principal may otherwise
have. Moreover, the indemnification provided for in Clauses (B) and (C) above
shall be effective whether or not an indemnification certificate described in
(A) above is provided and shall be applicable based on information previously
provided by Borrower and Borrower Principal or their Affiliates if Borrower or
Borrower Principal do not provide the indemnification certificate so long as
Lender provides Borrower with the disclosure thereof and prospectus as set forth
in this Section 13.5(b).


                                      -89-
<PAGE>
            (c) In connection with the initial filings under the Exchange Act in
connection with a Securitization of the Loan, Borrower and Borrower Principal
agree to indemnify (i) Lender, the Issuer Group and the Underwriter Group for
Losses to which Lender, the Issuer Group or the Underwriter Group may become
subject insofar as the Securities Liabilities arise out of or are based solely
upon the omission or alleged omission to state in the Provided Information
delivered to Lender prior to the Securitization a material fact required to be
stated in the Provided Information in order to make the statements in the
Provided Information, in light of the circumstances under which they were made
not misleading and (ii) reimburse Lender, the Issuer Group or the Underwriter
Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by Lender, the Issuer
Group or the Underwriter Group in connection with defending or investigating the
Securities Liabilities; provided that in the event that such filings under the
Exchange Act contain information in a form not previously reviewed by Borrower,
then Lender shall provide Borrower with a copy of such filings for its approval
of the content thereof prior to submitting the same.

            (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 13.5 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
under this Section 13.5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will
not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying
party may have to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that
failure to notify causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that
any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be
entitled, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and,
to the extent that it (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the
indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, so long as there is
not a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party and any indemnified
party or parties, as reasonably determined by counsel to such indemnified party
or parties, the indemnified party or parties shall not engage additional counsel
to assume such defense on behalf of the related indemnifying party. After notice
from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party under this Section 13.5
the indemnifying party shall be responsible for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, if the
defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded
that there are any legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
parties that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party, and that there is a conflict of interest between the
indemnified party or parties and the indemnifying party, as reasonably
determined by counsel to such indemnified party or parties, the indemnified
party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such
legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on
behalf of such indemnified party or parties. The indemnifying party shall not be
liable for the expenses of more than one such separate counsel unless an
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those
available to another indemnified party.

            (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 13.5(b)
or Section 13.5(c) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be
indemnifiable under Section 13.5(b) or Section 13.5(c), the indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which
the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered:
(i) the indemnified party's, Borrower's and Borrower Principal's relative
knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which
claim was asserted; (ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or
omission; and (iii) any other equitable considerations appropriate in the
circumstances. Lender, Borrower and Borrower Principal hereby agree that it
would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro
rata or per capita allocation.

            (f) The liabilities and obligations of Borrower and Lender under
this Section 13.5 shall survive the satisfaction of this Agreement and the
satisfaction and discharge of the Debt. The liabilities and obligations of
Borrower Principal under this Section 13.5 and any certificate provided pursuant
to the terms hereof shall only survive until November 30, 2006 and then shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect with respect to any matters for
which written claims have not been made against Borrower Principal prior to
November 30, 2006.

                                  ARTICLE XIV
                                INDEMNIFICATIONS

            SECTION 14.1. GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION

            Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out
of or in any way relating to any one or more of the following: (a) any accident,
injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property occurring in, on
or about the Property or any part thereof or on the adjoining sidewalks, curbs,
adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets or ways; (b) any use,
nonuse or condition in, on or about the Property or any part thereof or on the
adjoining sidewalks, curbs, adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets
or ways; (c) performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any
materials or other property in respect of the Property or any part thereof; (d)
any failure of the Property to be in compliance with any Applicable Legal
Requirements; (e) any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be
asserted against Lender by reason of any alleged obligations or undertakings on
its part to perform or discharge any of the terms, covenants, or agreements
contained in any Lease; (f) the holding or investing of the Reserve Accounts or
the performance of the Required Work, or (g) the payment of any commission,
charge or brokerage fee to anyone which may be payable in connection with the
funding of the Loan (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided,
however, that Borrower shall not have any obligation to Lender hereunder (i) to
the extent that such Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence,
illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender and (ii) with


                                      -91-
<PAGE>
respect to any Indemnified Liability (A) not caused by Borrower and (B) first
arising after the date Borrower is no longer in possession or control of the
Property whether due to foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or the
appointment of a receiver. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay
the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law
to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
Lender.

            SECTION 14.2. MORTGAGE AND INTANGIBLE TAX INDEMNIFICATION

            Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way
relating to any tax on the making and/or recording of the Mortgage, the Note or
any of the other Loan Documents, but excluding any income, franchise or other
similar taxes.

            SECTION 14.3. ERISA INDEMNIFICATION

            Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of Losses
incurred in correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA that may be required, in Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur,
directly or indirectly, as a result of a default under Section 4.9 or Section
5.18 of this Agreement.

            SECTION 14.4. SURVIVAL

            The obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this Article 14
shall fully survive indefinitely notwithstanding any termination, satisfaction,
assignment, entry of a judgment of foreclosure, exercise of any power of sale,
or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage.

                                   ARTICLE XV
                                   EXCULPATION

            SECTION 15.1. EXCULPATION

            (a) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the other Loan
Documents, Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower or
Borrower Principal, as applicable, to pay, perform and/or observe the
obligations contained herein, in the Note, or in the other Loan Documents by any
action or proceeding against Borrower wherein a money judgment shall be sought
against Borrower, the members/partners of Borrower or Borrower Principal or its
respective members or partners, except that Lender may bring a foreclosure
action, action for specific performance or other appropriate action or
proceeding against Borrower to enable Lender to enforce and realize upon this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, and the interest
in the Property, the Rents and any other collateral given to Lender


                                      -92-
<PAGE>
created by this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents;
provided, however, that any judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
enforceable against Borrower only to the extent of Borrower's interest in the
Property, in the Rents and in any other collateral given to Lender. Lender, by
accepting this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents,
agrees that it shall not, except as otherwise provided in Section 15.1(b) and
(c), sue for, seek or demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower or
Borrower Principal in any such action or proceeding, under or by reason of or
under or in connection with this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other
Loan Documents. The provisions of this Section 15.1 shall not, however, (i)
constitute a waiver, release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or
secured by this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents;
(ii) impair the right of Lender to name Borrower as a party defendant in any
action or suit for judicial foreclosure and sale under this Agreement and the
Mortgage; (iii) affect the validity or enforceability of any indemnity
(including, without limitation, those contained in Section 12.6, Section 13.5
and Article 14 of this Agreement), made in connection with this Agreement, the
Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents; (iv) impair the right of Lender
to obtain the appointment of a receiver; (v) impair the enforcement of the
assignment of leases provisions contained in the Mortgage; or (vi) impair the
right of Lender to obtain a deficiency judgment against Borrower or other
judgment on the Note against Borrower if necessary to obtain any Insurance
Proceeds or Awards to which Lender would otherwise be entitled under this
Agreement; provided however, Lender shall only enforce such judgment to the
extent of the Insurance Proceeds and/or Awards.

            (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 15.1 to the
contrary, Borrower and Borrower Principal shall be personally liable to Lender
on a joint and several basis for Losses due to:

            (i) fraud, material intentional misrepresentation, gross negligence
      or willful misconduct by Borrower, Borrower Principal or any other
      Affiliate of Borrower or Borrower Principal in connection with the
      execution and the delivery of this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage, any
      of the other Loan Documents, or any certificate, report, financial
      statement or other instrument or document furnished to Lender at the time
      of the closing of the Loan or during the term of the Loan;

            (ii) Borrower's, Borrower Principal's or any of their Affiliates'
      misapplication or misappropriation of Rents received by Borrower, to the
      extent Borrower or any Affiliate has the ability to control the
      distribution or application thereof, after the occurrence of an Event of
      Default;

            (iii) Borrower's, Borrower Principal's or any of their Affiliates'
      misapplication or misappropriation of tenant security deposits or Rents
      collected in advance, to the extent Borrower or any Affiliate has the
      ability to control the distribution or application thereof;

            (iv) Borrower's, Borrower Principal's or any of their Affiliates'
      misapplication or the misappropriation of Insurance Proceeds or Awards, to
      the extent Borrower or any Affiliate has the ability to control the
      distribution or application thereof;


                                      -93-
<PAGE>
            (v) Borrower's failure to pay Taxes or Other Charges (except to the
      extent that sums sufficient to pay such amounts have been deposited in
      escrow with Lender pursuant to the terms hereof and there exists no
      impediment to Lender's utilization thereof (whether or not used by Lender
      for such purpose) or the Property is not generating sufficient proceeds to
      pay such Taxes or Other Chartes);

            (vi) intentionally reserved;

            (vii) any act of actual physical waste or arson by Borrower, any
      principal, Affiliate, member or general partner thereof or by Borrower
      Principal, any principal, Affiliate, member or general partner thereof;

            (viii) Borrower's failure following any Event of Default to deliver
      to Lender upon demand all Rents collected by Borrower after such Event of
      Default and books and records relating to the Property;

            (ix) Borrower's withdrawal following an Event of Default of any
      amounts from any Property Operating Account, except as directed by Lender;
      or

            (x) Borrower's failure to complete the Required Repairs within the
      time frames set forth in Section 9.1 hereof, to the extent Lender has not
      required Borrower to make a deposit into the Required Repair Account
      pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1 hereof.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not to
pursue recourse liability as set forth in subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME NULL
AND VOID and shall be of no further force and effect and the Debt immediately
shall become fully recourse to Borrower and Borrower Principal, jointly and
severally, in the event of (i) a default by Borrower, Borrower Principal or any
SPE Component Entity (if any) of any of the covenants set forth in Article 6,
except the extent that such breach was inadvertent, immaterial and is promptly
cured, (ii) of a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Article 7 hereof,
or (iii) if (A) a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by
Borrower under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any similar federal or state law, or
(B) an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced against
Borrower or Borrower Principal in connection with which Borrower, Borrower
Principal, SPE Component Entity or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing has or
have colluded in any way with the creditors commencing or filing such
proceeding.

            (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right which
Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provision of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of the indebtedness
secured by the Mortgage or to require that all collateral shall continue to
secure all of the indebtedness owing to Lender in accordance with this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents.

expedited prepaid delivery and telecopy, upon the first attempted delivery on a

                                  ARTICLE XVII
                               FURTHER ASSURANCES

            SECTION 17.1. REPLACEMENT DOCUMENTS

            Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of Lender as to the loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation of the Note or any other Loan Document which is
not of public record, and, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender
and cancellation of such Note or other Loan Document, Borrower will issue, in
lieu thereof, a replacement Note or other Loan Document, dated the date of such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or other Loan Document in the same
principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor.

            SECTION 17.2. RECORDING OF MORTGAGE, ETC.

            Borrower forthwith upon the execution and delivery of the Mortgage
and thereafter, from time to time, will cause the Mortgage and any of the other
Loan Documents


                                      -96-
<PAGE>
creating a lien or security interest or evidencing the lien hereof upon the
Property and each instrument of further assurance to be filed, registered or
recorded in such manner and in such places as may be required by any present or
future law in order to publish notice of and fully to protect and perfect the
lien or security interest hereof upon, and the interest of Lender in, the
Property. Borrower will pay all taxes, filing, registration or recording fees,
and all expenses incident to the preparation, execution, acknowledgment and/or
recording of the Note, the Mortgage, the other Loan Documents, any note, deed of
trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with respect to
the Property and any instrument of further assurance, and any modification or
amendment of the foregoing documents, and all federal, state, county and
municipal taxes, duties, imposts, assessments and charges arising out of or in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Mortgage, any deed of trust or
mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with respect to the
Property or any instrument of further assurance, and any modification or
amendment of the foregoing documents, except where prohibited by law so to do.
Lender agrees to reasonably cooperate, at Borrower's expense, with reasonable
requests made by Borrower to assign this Agreement, or any of the other Loan
Documents to a new lender in connection with a refinance of the Loan in order to
minimize the tax obligations incurred by Borrower in connection with such
refinance

            SECTION 17.3. FURTHER ACTS, ETC.

            Borrower will, at the cost of Borrower, and without expense to
Lender, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and every further acts, deeds,
conveyances, deeds of trust, mortgages, assignments, security agreements,
control agreements, notices of assignments, transfers and assurances as Lender
shall, from time to time, reasonably require, for the better assuring,
conveying, assigning, transferring, and confirming unto Lender the property and
rights hereby mortgaged, deeded, granted, bargained, sold, conveyed, confirmed,
pledged, assigned, warranted and transferred or intended now or hereafter so to
be, or which Borrower may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or assign
to Lender, or for carrying out the intention or facilitating the performance of
the terms of this Agreement or for filing, registering or recording the
Mortgage, or for complying with all Legal Requirements; provided, however, none
of the foregoing shall materially increase the obligations or reduce the rights
of Borrower hereunder. Borrower, on demand, will execute and deliver, and in the
event it shall fail to so execute and deliver, hereby authorizes Lender to
execute in the name of Borrower or without the signature of Borrower to the
extent Lender may lawfully do so, one or more financing statements and financing
statement amendments to evidence more effectively, perfect and maintain the
priority of the security interest of Lender in the Property. Borrower grants to
Lender an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest for the purpose
of exercising and perfecting any and all rights and remedies available to Lender
at law and in equity, including without limitation, such rights and remedies
available to Lender pursuant to this Section 17.3.

            SECTION 17.4. CHANGES IN TAX, DEBT, CREDIT AND DOCUMENTARY STAMP
LAWS

            (a) If any law is enacted or adopted or amended after the date of
this Agreement which deducts the Debt from the value of the Property for the
purpose of taxation or which imposes a tax, either directly or indirectly, on
the Debt or Lender's interest in the Property, Borrower will pay the tax, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any. If Lender is advised by counsel chosen
by it that the payment of tax by Borrower would be unlawful or


                                      -97-
<PAGE>
taxable to Lender or unenforceable or provide the basis for a defense of usury
then Lender shall have the option by written notice of not less than one hundred
twenty (120) days to declare the Debt immediately due and payable without
imposing any prepayment premium or charge thereon.

            (b) Borrower will not claim or demand or be entitled to any credit
or credits on account of the Debt for any part of the Taxes or Other Charges
assessed against the Property, or any part thereof, and no deduction shall
otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value of the Property, or any
part thereof, for real estate tax purposes by reason of the Mortgage or the
Debt. If such claim, credit or deduction shall be required by law, Lender shall
have the option, by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120)
days, to declare the Debt immediately due and payable without imposing any
prepayment premium or charge thereon.

            If at any time the United States of America, any State thereof or
any subdivision of any such State shall require revenue or other stamps to be
affixed to the Note, the Mortgage, or any of the other Loan Documents or impose
any other tax or charge on the same, Borrower will pay for the same, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any.

            SECTION 17.5. EXPENSES

            Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay,
to reimburse, Lender upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable, actual attorneys' fees and
disbursements and the allocated costs of internal legal services and all actual
disbursements of internal counsel) reasonably incurred by Lender in accordance
with this Agreement in connection with (a) the preparation, negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and all the
costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for Borrower (including without
limitation any opinions requested by Lender as to any legal matters arising
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with respect to the Property);
(b) Borrower's ongoing performance of and compliance with Borrower's respective
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date,
including, without limitation, confirming compliance with environmental and
insurance requirements; (c) following a request by Borrower, Lender's ongoing
performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied
with after the Closing Date; (d) the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and administration of any consents, amendments, waivers or other
modifications to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other
documents or matters requested by Lender (except as expressly limited by the
provisions of the provisions of Section 13.4 hereof); (e) securing Borrower's
compliance with any requests made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement;
(f) the filing and recording fees and expenses, title insurance and reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel for providing to Lender all required legal
opinions, and other similar expenses incurred in creating and perfecting the
Lien in favor of Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
(g) enforcing or preserving any rights, in response to third party claims or the
prosecuting or defending of any action or proceeding or other litigation, in
each case against, under or affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the Property, or any other security given for the Loan; and (h)
enforcing any obligations of or collecting any


                                      -98-
<PAGE>
payments due from Borrower under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or
with respect to the Property or in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the
nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings; provided,
however, that Borrower shall not be liable for the payment of any such costs and
expenses to the extent the same arise by reason of the gross negligence, illegal
acts, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender.

                                 ARTICLE XVIII
                                     WAIVERS

            SECTION 18.1. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS

            The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower or Borrower Principal pursuant to this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise except as
limited by Article XV hereof. Lender's rights, powers and remedies may be
pursued singularly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as
Lender may determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay or omission to
exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall
impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a waiver
thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time
and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or Event of
Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver of any
subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any remedy,
right or power consequent thereon.

            SECTION 18.2. MODIFICATION, WAIVER IN WRITING

            No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or of the Note, or of any other Loan
Document, nor consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be in a writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance, and for the purpose, for which given. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to, or demand on Borrower, shall
entitle Borrower to any other or future notice or demand in the same, similar or
other circumstances.

            SECTION 18.3. DELAY NOT A WAIVER

            Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender in insisting
upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement, or
exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note or
under any other Loan Document, or any other instrument given as security
therefor, shall operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of
any other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of
limitation, by accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under
this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document, Lender shall not be deemed
to have waived any right either to require prompt payment when due of all other
amounts due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan


                                      -99-
<PAGE>
Documents, or to declare a default for failure to effect prompt payment of any
such other amount.

            SECTION 18.4. TRIAL BY JURY

            BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREES NOT TO
ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR
HEREAFTER EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR
OTHER ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IS GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND
LENDER, AND IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE
AS TO WHICH THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. EACH OF LENDER,
BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND BORROWER IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS
PARAGRAPH IN ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY BORROWER,
BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER.

            SECTION 18.5. WAIVER OF NOTICE

            Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature
whatsoever from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of
notice by Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which
Borrower is not, pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive
the giving of notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any
notice from Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of
notice by Lender to Borrower.

            SECTION 18.6. REMEDIES OF BORROWER

            In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment. Lender
agrees that, in such event, it shall cooperate in expediting any action seeking
injunctive relief or declaratory judgment.

            SECTION 18.7. WAIVER OF MARSHALLING OF ASSETS

            To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its
successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Property, and agrees not to assert any right under


                                     -100-
<PAGE>
any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of
alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or
any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender
under the Loan Documents to a sale of the Property for the collection of the
Debt without any prior or different resort for collection or of the right of
Lender to the payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Property in
preference to every other claimant whatsoever.

            SECTION 18.8. WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

            Borrower hereby expressly waives and releases, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the pleading of any statute of limitations as a defense to
payment of the Debt or performance of its Other Obligations.

            SECTION 18.9. WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM

            Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other
than a compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it
by Lender or its agents; provided, however, nothing in this section shall
prevent Borrower from, subject to the provisions of Section 18.6 above,
asserting such claim or counterclaim in a separate action against Lender.

                                  ARTICLE XIX
                                  GOVERNING LAW

            SECTION 19.1. CHOICE OF LAW

            This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract entered into
pursuant to the laws of the State of New York and shall in all respects be
governed, construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York, provided however, (a) that with respect to the creation,
perfection, priority and enforcement of any Lien created by the Loan Documents,
and the determination of deficiency judgments, the laws of the state where the
Property is located shall apply, and (b) with respect to the security interest
in each of the Reserve Accounts, the laws of the state where each such account
is located shall apply.

            SECTION 19.2. SEVERABILITY

            Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

            SECTION 19.3. PREFERENCES

            During the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall have the
continuing and exclusive right to apply or reverse and reapply any and all
payments by Borrower to any portion of the obligations of Borrower hereunder. To
the extent Borrower makes a payment or payments to Lender, which payment or
proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently


                                     -101-
<PAGE>
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to
be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Creditors Rights
Laws, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent
of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations hereunder or part thereof
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full force and effect,
as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Lender.

                                   ARTICLE XX
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            SECTION 20.1. SURVIVAL

            This Agreement and all covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made herein and in the certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall
survive the making by Lender of the Loan and the execution and delivery to
Lender of the Note, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as all
or any of the Debt is outstanding and unpaid unless a longer period is expressly
set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Whenever in this Agreement any
of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include
the legal representatives, successors and assigns of such party. All covenants,
promises and agreements in this Agreement, by or on behalf of Borrower, shall
inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of
Lender.

            SECTION 20.2. LENDER'S DISCRETION

            Whenever pursuant to this Agreement, Lender exercises any right
given to it to approve or disapprove, or any arrangement or term is to be
satisfactory to Lender, the decision of Lender to approve or disapprove or to
decide whether arrangements or terms are satisfactory or not satisfactory shall
(except as is otherwise specifically herein provided) be in the sole discretion
of Lender and shall be final and conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 20.3. HEADINGS

            The Article and/or Section headings and the Table of Contents in
this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall
not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

            SECTION 20.4. COST OF ENFORCEMENT

            In the event (a) that the Mortgage is foreclosed in whole or in
part, (b) of the bankruptcy, insolvency, rehabilitation or other similar
proceeding in respect of Borrower or any of its constituent Persons or an
assignment by Borrower or any of its constituent Persons for the benefit of its
creditors, or (c) Lender exercises any of its other remedies under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, Borrower shall be chargeable with
and agrees to pay all costs of collection and defense, including attorneys' fees
and costs, incurred by Lender or Borrower in connection therewith and in
connection with any appellate proceeding or post-judgment action involved
therein, together with all required service or use taxes.


                                     -102-
<PAGE>
            SECTION 20.5. SCHEDULES INCORPORATED

            The Schedules annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein as a
part of this Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

            SECTION 20.6. OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES

            Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note
and the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to such documents which Borrower
may otherwise have against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated
counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by Borrower in any
action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such documents and any
such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or
defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

            SECTION 20.7. NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP; NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES

            (a) Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and
lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture,
partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower
and Lender nor to grant Lender any interest in the Property other than that of
mortgagee, beneficiary or lender.

            (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the
benefit of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender,
Borrower and Borrower Principal any right to insist upon or to enforce the
performance or observance of any of the obligations contained herein or therein.
All conditions to the obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are
imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person
shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance
with their terms or be entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make the
Loan in the absence of strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other
Person shall under any circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such
conditions, any or all of which may be freely waived in whole or in part by
Lender if, in Lender's sole discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable
to do so.

            (c) The general partners, members, principals and (if Borrower is a
trust) beneficial owners of Borrower are experienced in the ownership and
operation of properties similar to the Property, and Borrower and Lender are
relying solely upon such expertise and business plan in connection with the
ownership and operation of the Property. Borrower is not relying on Lender's
expertise, business acumen or advice in connection with the Property.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Lender is not undertaking the performance of (i) any obligations under the
Leases; or (ii) any obligations with respect to such agreements, contracts,
certificates, instruments, franchises, permits, trademarks, licenses and other
documents.

            (e) By accepting or approving anything required to be observed,
performed or fulfilled or to be given to Lender pursuant to this Agreement, the
Mortgage, the Note or the other


                                     -103-
<PAGE>
Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any officer's certificate,
balance sheet, statement of profit and loss or other financial statement,
survey, appraisal, or insurance policy, Lender shall not be deemed to have
warranted, consented to, or affirmed the sufficiency, the legality or
effectiveness of same, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not
constitute any warranty or affirmation with respect thereto by Lender.
