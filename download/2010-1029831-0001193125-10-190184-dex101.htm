HGI and its Subsidiaries. I have, together with other members of the management of HGI, acted on behalf of HGI in connection with the negotiation of the Credit Agreement and I am familiar with the terms and conditions thereof. </FONT></P>

for the period from the Closing Date through December&nbsp;31, 2016 and on an annual basis for each of the following three fiscal years (the &#147;<U>Projected Financial Statements</U>&#148;). The Projected Financial Statements, which are attached
hereto as Exhibit A, give effect to the consummation of the Proposed Transactions and assume that the debt obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement will be paid from the cash flow generated by the operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and other resources (including, without limitation, refinancings, asset sales and other capital market transactions available at the time). The Projected Financial Statements were prepared on the basis of information available at
April&nbsp;29, 2010. The Projected Financial Statements do not reflect (i)&nbsp;any potential changes in interest rates other than from those assumed in the Projected Financial Statements, (ii)&nbsp;any potential material, adverse changes in general
business or economic conditions, or (iii)&nbsp;any potential changes in income tax laws. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have

effect to the Proposed Transactions. The Fair Value Summary Balance Sheet is attached hereto as Exhibit B. </FONT></P>

which the Projected Financial Statements are based are stated therein. Although any assumptions and any projections by necessity involve uncertainties and approximations, I believe, based on my discussions with other members of management, that the
assumptions on which the Projected Financial Statements are based are reasonable in light of current conditions and facts known to me. However, it is understood that the Lenders and the Administrative Agent recognize that projections as to future
events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during the periods covered by the Projected Financial Statements will differ from projected results and that such differences may be material. </FONT></P>

contingent or otherwise, as such debts become absolute and mature. For purposes of this Certificate, I understand &#147;fair value&#148; of any assets to mean the amount which may be realized within a reasonable time through sale of such assets and
the related business as a going concern at the regular market value thereof, with the fair value also being the amount which could be obtained for the property in question within such period from an interested buyer who is willing to purchase under
ordinary selling conditions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the foregoing, as of the date hereof, I have reached the
