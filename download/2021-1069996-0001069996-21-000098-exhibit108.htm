ARTICLE III  SPECIAL TERMINATION AND OTHER REMEDIES  A. The Company may terminate the share of the Reinsurer at any time, either during the term  or after the expiration of this Contract, by giving written notice to the Reinsurer in the  event the Reinsurer experiences one or more Special Termination Event(s).  The effective  date of termination shall be the date selected by the Company, which may be a date that is  retroactively applied up to a maximum of 90 days prior to the earliest of either the date of  public announcement or the date of discovery, as applicable, of the Reinsurer experiencing  one or more Special Termination Event(s), subject to the condition that such selected date  must be the last day of a calendar month.  A &#8220;Special Termination Event&#8221; shall be deemed  to have occurred in the event of any of the following circumstances:  1. A State Insurance Department or other legal authority orders the Reinsurer to cease  writing business;  2. The Reinsurer has voluntarily ceased assuming new and renewal reinsurance business  for the lines of business covered hereunder;  3.

For any period not exceeding 12 months, which commences no earlier than  12 months prior to the inception of this Contract, the Reinsurer&#8217;s policyholders&#8217;  surplus (or total stamp capacity by managing agent as respects Lloyd&#8217;s of London  syndicates), as reported in the financial statements of the Reinsurer, has been reduced  by 20% or more;  5.

The Reinsurer has transferred its claims-paying authority under this Contract to an  unaffiliated entity or in any other way has assigned its interests or delegated its  obligations under this Contract to an unaffiliated entity without the Company&#8217;s prior  written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the transfer of claims-paying  authority or administration to a third party, where the Reinsurer maintains control  over claims settlement decisions, shall not constitute a transfer of its claims-paying  authority for purposes of this subparagraph and agreement by a Lloyd&#8217;s syndicate to  follow claim settlements procedures under Lloyd&#8217;s 2006 Claims Settlement Scheme  or agreement by an International Underwriting Association of London company to  follow IUA Claims Agreement practices shall not constitute a transfer of its claims- paying authority, for purposes of this subparagraph;  10. The Reinsurer has failed to comply with the funding requirements set forth in the  RESERVES AND FUNDING ARTICLE; or  11. The Reinsurer, directly or through the actions of a parent company or an affiliated  entity, has invoked any statute, legislation, or jurisprudence that purports to enable  the Reinsurer to:  a. Require the Company to settle its claims liabilities, including but not limited to  any estimated or undetermined claims liabilities under this Contract, on an  accelerated basis.  This does not include any attempt to enforce a settlement of  claims liabilities under a commutation process to which the parties have agreed;  or  b. Novate its liabilities under this Contract to a third party without the Company&#8217;s  prior written consent.   Unless it is prohibited by law from doing so, immediately upon the Reinsurer&#8217;s knowledge  of a Special Termination Event, the Reinsurer must notify the Company of such event in  writing, by electronic mail, certified mail, or a nationally or internationally recognized  delivery service.  B. Where a Special Termination Event has taken place and after giving the Reinsurer prior  written notice by electronic mail, certified mail, or by a nationally or internationally  recognized delivery service, the Company may invoke any one or a combination of the  following:  1. The Company may terminate or reduce the Reinsurer&#8217;s share hereunder effective at  any time following the Reinsurer&#8217;s receipt of the written notice.  In such event, the  entire liability of the Reinsurer for losses subsequent to the date of termination shall  cease concurrently with the date of termination.  Upon such termination, the  Reinsurer shall refund to the Company the unearned portion of the reinsurance  premium paid to it hereon (calculated on a pro rata expiration basis) and any  minimum premium hereon shall be waived.  2. The Company may require the Reinsurer to fund its share of outstanding loss and  Loss Adjustment Expense reserves, reserves for losses and Loss Adjustment Expense  incurred but not reported to the Company (IBNR as determined by the Company),  </FONT></DIV>

Within 30 days of the Company&#8217;s  written request to fund, the Reinsurer shall render the requested funding (less any  such amounts already funded pursuant to the provisions of the RESERVES AND  FUNDING ARTICLE) to the Company by means of one of the methods of funding  described in the RESERVES AND FUNDING ARTICLE.  The Company and the  Reinsurer may mutually agree on alternative methods of funding or the use of a  combination of methods.  The Company may draw upon such funding in accordance  with the provisions of the RESERVES AND FUNDING ARTICLE.  Within 60 days  following each subsequent calendar quarter, the Company may prepare and forward  to the Reinsurer a statement of the Reinsurer&#8217;s current funding obligation under this  subparagraph.  Where such amount exceeds the balance of funding already rendered  by the Reinsurer, the Reinsurer shall, within 30 days of its receipt of such statement,  increase the amount of funding available to the current, reported level.  If, however,  the statement shows that the Reinsurer&#8217;s current funding obligation is less than the  balance of funding as of the statement date, the Company shall, within 30 days after  receipt of written request from the Reinsurer, release such excess funding by making  the appropriate adjustment.  This funding option is available to the Company at any  time there remain any outstanding liabilities of the Reinsurer.  3. The Company may require that the Reinsurer commute all present and future  liabilities under this Contract in return for a full and final release of all such liabilities.   If the Company and Reinsurer cannot agree on the capitalized value of the  Reinsurer&#8217;s liabilities, they shall appoint an independent actuary.  If the Company and  Reinsurer cannot agree on an actuary, the Company and the Reinsurer shall each  nominate three individuals, of whom the other shall decline two, and the final  decision shall be made by drawing lots.  All the actuaries selected shall be  disinterested in the outcome of the commutation and shall be Fellows of the Casualty  Actuarial Society.  The decision in writing of the appointed actuary, when filed with  the parties hereto, shall be final and binding on both parties.  The expense of the  actuary and of the actuarial calculation shall be equally divided between the two  parties.  Said actuarial calculation shall take place in a location chosen by the  Company.  This commutation option is available to the Company at any time there  remain any outstanding liabilities of the Reinsurer.  Until the final resolution of any  such commutation, settlements of amounts due hereunder shall continue in  accordance with the terms of this Contract.  C. The Company may revoke its notice hereunder, prior to the date of termination, without  prejudice to reinstitute later if it so chooses.  D. The Company, at its sole option, may classify the Reinsurer as a &#8220;Run-off Reinsurer,&#8221;  where said Reinsurer experiences one or more of the Special Termination Events set forth  in subparagraphs 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 under paragraph A above.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, in the event that a Reinsurer becomes  classified by the Company as a Run-off Reinsurer at any time, the Company may elect, by  giving written notice to the Run-off Reinsurer at any time thereafter, that all or any of the  following shall apply to the Run-off Reinsurer&#8217;s share hereunder:  </FONT></DIV>

If payment of any claim has been received from the Reinsurers constituting at least  70% of the interests and liabilities of all the Reinsurers that participated on this  Contract and are active as of the due date, it being understood that said date shall not  be later than 90 days from the date of transmittal by the intermediary of the initial  billing for each such payment, the Run-off Reinsurer shall be estopped from denying  such claim and must pay within 10 days following transmittal to the Run-off  Reinsurer of written notification of such payments.  For purposes of this  subparagraph, a Reinsurer shall be deemed to be active if it is not a Run-off  Reinsurer.  2. The interest penalty specified in the LATE PAYMENTS ARTICLE shall be  increased by 0.5% for each 30 days that the payment is past due, subject to a  maximum increase of 7.0%.  3. In the event that either party demands arbitration of a dispute between the Company  and the Run-off Reinsurer, and the amount in dispute is less than $250,000, unless the  arbitration notice includes a demand for rescission of this Contract, notwithstanding  the terms of the ARBITRATION ARTICLE, the dispute shall be resolved by a sole  arbitrator and the following procedures shall apply:  a. The sole arbitrator shall be chosen by mutual agreement of the parties within 15  business days after the demand for arbitration.  If the parties have not chosen an  arbitrator within the 15 business days after receipt of the arbitration notice, the  arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the Neutral Selection Procedure  modified for a single arbitrator, established by the AIDA Reinsurance and  Insurance Arbitration Society &#8211; U.S. (ARIAS) and in force on the date the  arbitration is demanded.  The nominated arbitrator must be available to read any  written submissions and hear testimony within 60 days of being chosen.  b. Within 10 business days after the arbitrator has been appointed, the parties shall  be notified of deadlines for the submission of briefs and documentary evidence,  as determined by the arbitrator.  There shall be no discovery or hearing unless  the parties agree to engage in limited discovery and/or a hearing.  Also, the  arbitrator can determine, without the consent of the parties, that a limited  hearing is necessary.  c. The arbitrator shall render a decision within 10 business days after the later of  the date on which briefs are submitted or the end of the limited hearing.  The  decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be final and binding on  both parties.  d. &#8220;Business days&#8221; mean days that are not a Saturday, Sunday or a U.S. federal  holiday.  E. The Company&#8217;s waiver of any rights provided in this Article is not a waiver of that right or  other rights at a later date.  </FONT></DIV>

Declaratory Judgment Expense shall be deemed to have been incurred on the  date of the original loss giving rise to the declaratory judgment action.  B. Extra Contractual Obligations/Loss in Excess of Policy Limits   1. Extra Contractual Obligations   &#8220;Extra Contractual Obligations&#8221; shall mean those liabilities not covered under any  other provision of this Contract, including any punitive, exemplary, compensatory, or  consequential damages, which arise from the handling of any claim on business  covered hereunder; such liabilities arising because of, but not limited to, the  following:  failure to settle within the Policy limit, or by reason of alleged or actual  negligence, fraud or bad faith in rejecting an offer of settlement, in preparation of the  defense, in the trial of any action against its insured, reinsured, its insured&#8217;s or  reinsured&#8217;s assignee or a third party claimant, or in the preparation or prosecution of  an appeal consequent upon such action.  2.

The  Reinsurer shall provide funding and/or any adjustments thereto in time for the Company to  meet the requirements of each applicable insurance regulatory authority having jurisdiction  over the Company&#8217;s reserves, provided that the Company sends the report of Reinsurer&#8217;s  Obligations at least 15 days prior to the date such funding is required.

If  the issuing bank of the LOC is put under negative credit watch by a major rating agency or  is removed from the list of banks approved by the NAIC Securities Valuation Office, the  Company may require that a replacement LOC be issued by a bank acceptable to the  Company, by providing the Reinsurer with written notice requesting such replacement  LOC.

D. The Reinsurer and Company agree that any funding provided by the Reinsurer pursuant to  the provisions of this Contract may be drawn upon at any time, notwithstanding any other  provision of this Contract, and be utilized by the Company or any successor, by operation  of law, of the Company including, without limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver,  or conservator of the Company for the following purposes:  1. To reimburse the Company for the Reinsurer&#8217;s share of unearned premium on  Policies reinsured hereunder on account of cancellations of such Policies;  2. To reimburse the Company for the Reinsurer&#8217;s Obligations, the payment of which is  due under the terms of this Contract and which has not been otherwise paid;  3. To make refund of any sum which is in excess of the actual amount required to pay  the Reinsurer&#8217;s Obligations under this Contract (or in excess of 102% of Reinsurer&#8217;s  Obligations, if funding is provided by a Trust Account);  4. To fund an account with the Company for the Reinsurer&#8217;s Obligations if such LOC is  under notice of non-renewal or not replaced by the Reinsurer within 10 days prior to  its expiration.

To pay the Reinsurer&#8217;s share of any other amounts the Company claims are due under  this Contract.   In the event the amount drawn by the Company on any funding provided by the Reinsurer  is in excess of the actual amount required for subparagraph 1, 2, or 4 or, in the case of  subparagraph 5, the actual amount determined to be due, the Company shall promptly  return to the Reinsurer the excess amount so drawn.

If the report shows that the Reinsurer&#8217;s Obligations exceed the available balance of  the funds withheld and/or cash advances and/or escrow accounts and/or LOC and/or  Trust Account as of the report date, the Reinsurer shall, within 30 days after receipt of  </FONT></DIV>

The Reinsurer may, at its own expense, reasonably request copies of such  files and agrees to pay the Company&#8217;s reasonable costs (including staff expense and other  overhead costs) incurred in procuring such copies.  B. The Reinsurer or its designated representative(s) shall not have access to Protected Records  related to a claim ceded to this Contract; however, the Reinsurer shall be permitted to have  access to those Protected Records described in subparagraph F.2 of this Article after the  Company&#8217;s final settlement or final adjudication of such underlying claim.

The provisions of this Article shall extend to the officers, directors, and employees of the  Reinsurer and its affiliates, who have received Confidential Information in accordance with  this Contract, and shall be binding upon their successors and assigns.  F. The Reinsurer acknowledges that any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information  may cause irreparable harm to the Company.  If Confidential Information is acquired by or  made available to an unauthorized third party due to the Reinsurer&#8217;s breach of this Article,  the Reinsurer shall notify the Company without undue delay upon discovery and the  Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance, including immediate issuance of a  temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.  The Company shall be entitled to  seek damages, attorney&#8217;s fees and costs, and any other remedies available under the law  due to the Reinsurer&#8217;s breach of this Article.  The Company may concurrently or  alternatively seek legal relief by way of arbitration as provided for in this Contract.  ARTICLE XXVIII  INSOLVENCY  A. In the event of the insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance shall be payable directly to  the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor, with  reasonable provision for verification, on the basis of the liability of the Company without  diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or because the liquidator, receiver,  conservator, or statutory successor of the Company has failed to pay all or a portion of any  claim.  It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory  successor of the Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a  claim against the Company, indicating the Policy reinsured which claim would involve a  possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer, within a reasonable time after such claim is  filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during  the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its  own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or  defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator,  or statutory successor.  The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable,  subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company as part of the expense of  conservation or liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit that may  accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.  B. Where two or more Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest  elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance  with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the Company.  C. It is further agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Company, the reinsurance  under this Contract shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company or its  liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor, except 1) where this Contract  specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of  the Company or 2) where the Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds  has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer  to the payee under such Policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to  such payees.  </FONT></DIV>

E. In the event of the insolvency of any company or companies covered hereunder, the laws of  the applicable domiciliary state(s) shall apply.  In the event of a conflict between any  provision of this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state of any company or companies  covered hereunder, that domiciliary state&#8217;s laws shall prevail.  ARTICLE XXIX  ARBITRATION  A. As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, any irreconcilable dispute arising  out of the interpretation, performance, or breach of this Contract, including the formation  or validity thereof, whether arising before or after the expiry or termination of the Contract,  shall be submitted for decision to a panel of three arbitrators.  Notice requesting arbitration  shall be in writing and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or such reputable  courier service as is capable of returning proof of receipt of such notice by the recipient to  the party demanding arbitration.  B.

C. One arbitrator shall be appointed by each party.  If the responding party fails to appoint its  arbitrator within 30 days after its receipt of the claimant party&#8217;s notice requesting  arbitration, the claimant party, after 10 days&#8217; notice by certified mail or reputable courier as  provided above of its intention to do so, may appoint the second arbitrator.  D. The two arbitrators shall, before instituting the hearing, appoint an impartial third arbitrator  who shall preside at the hearing.  Should the two arbitrators fail to choose the third  arbitrator within 30 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator, the parties shall  appoint the third arbitrator pursuant to the AIDA Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration  Society &#8211; U.S. (ARIAS) Umpire Selection Procedure.

E. Within 30 days after notice of appointment of all arbitrators, the panel shall meet and  determine timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures and schedules for hearings. The  panel shall be relieved of all judicial formality and shall not be bound by the strict rules of  procedure and evidence.

The arbitration shall take place in Baton Rouge,  Louisiana, or at such other place as the parties shall agree. The decision of any two  arbitrators shall be in writing and shall be final and binding.  The panel is empowered to  grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate.  F. This Contract shall be interpreted as an honorable engagement rather than as merely a legal  obligation.  The panel shall make its decision as promptly as possible following the  termination of the hearings, considering the terms and conditions expressed in this Contract  and the custom and practice of the applicable insurance and reinsurance business.   Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  G. Arbitration proceedings are subject to consolidation as follows:  1. Single contract, multiple reinsurers, common issue:  If more than one Reinsurer is  involved in arbitration where there are common questions of law or fact and a  possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, all such Reinsurers, at the  Company&#8217;s request, shall be joined in a single arbitration proceeding and shall  constitute and act as one party for purposes of this Article and communications shall  be made by the Company to each of the Reinsurers constituting the one party;  provided, however, that nothing therein shall impair the rights of such Reinsurers to  assert several, rather than joint defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the  liability of the Reinsurers under the terms of this Contract from several to joint.  2. Single reinsurer, multiple contracts, common issue:  If any Reinsurer to this Contract  has subscribed to other reinsurance contracts with the Company, under which a  dispute has arisen where there are common questions of law or fact with the dispute  being arbitrated under this Contract and a possibility of conflicting awards or  inconsistent results, the Reinsurer, at the Company&#8217;s request, shall arbitrate all such  reinsurance disputes involving the same loss or common questions of law or fact in  one consolidated proceeding, subject to the provisions of this Article.  3. Single reinsurer, multiple contracts:  If any Reinsurer to this Contract has subscribed  to other reinsurance contracts with the Company and various disputes have arisen  under such contracts, regardless of whether or not there are common questions of law  or fact, if mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, the parties shall arbitrate all  reinsurance disputes in one consolidated proceeding, subject to the provisions of this  Article.   The agreement to consolidate disputes under this Contract and one or more other  reinsurance contracts will supersede all other reinsurance contracts entered into between  the Company and the Reinsurer, regardless of whether any other reinsurance contract may  require or address consolidation.  H. Each party shall bear the expense of the arbitrator selected by or for it and shall jointly and  equally bear with the other party the cost of the third arbitrator.  The remaining costs of the  arbitration shall be allocated by the panel.  The panel may, at its discretion, award such  further costs and expenses as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to  attorneys&#8217; fees, to the extent permitted by law.  </FONT></DIV>

Any assessments, other than interim and regular assessments, from a Residual Market Mechanism   included in subparagraph 1(c) above.  3.     The  Company  may  include  in  Ultimate  Net  Loss  for  any  Loss  Occurrence  covered hereunder only  the liability attributable to that Loss Occurrence.  If the relevant entity does not specify what portion of an  assessment is attributable to each Loss Occurrence, the Company may include in Ultimate Net Loss in  respect of each Loss Occurrence a percentage of the Company&#8217;s assessments from the relevant entity  related to the calendar year in which the Loss Occurrence commenced, regardless of when assessed, such  percentage to be determined by dividing the relevant entity&#8217;s losses arising from the Loss Occurrence by its  total losses for the calendar year.  4. The Company will deduct from Ultimate Net Loss amounts received as recoupment of any assessment that  has been included in the Ultimate Net Loss, provided the recoupment is directly allocable to the assessment  (&#8220;itemized recoupment&#8221;).  The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recoup such  assessment.   Any amount received as an itemized recoupment of any assessment (whether under this  Contract or any predecessor contract), and therefore deductible from Ultimate Net Loss, shall not be  included in the subject premium of this Contract.  However, if a state levies assessments but does not allow itemized recoupment from policyholders, instead  allowing the Company to file an overall increased rate, any such premium increased thereby shall not be  deemed to be a recoupment that is deductible from Ultimate Net Loss.  Any recoupment received as part of  a general premium rate increase, not specifically itemized, shall be included as part of the subject premium  of this Contract or a successor contract, as applicable.
