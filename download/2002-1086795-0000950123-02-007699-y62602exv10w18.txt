<PAGE>
Commitment at such time; provided, however, that no Revolving Credit Lender

Availability at such time. Each Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $100,000 (other than,
in each case, a Borrowing the proceeds of which shall be used solely to repay or
prepay in full outstanding Swing Line Advances, outstanding Letter of Credit

Availability at such time. No Swing Line Advance shall be used for the purpose
of funding the payment of principal of any other Swing Line Advance. Each Swing
Line Borrowing shall be made as a Prime Rate Advance. Within the limits of the
Swing Line Facility and within the limits referred to in clause (ii) above, the
Borrower may borrow and reborrow under this Section 2.1(d) and may repay or
prepay the Swing Line Advances at such times prior to the Termination Date, and

conditions hereinafter set forth, to issue letters of credit for the account of
the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the

<PAGE>
Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent on or prior to any date for notice of
renewal set forth in such Letter of Credit (but in any event at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date of the proposed renewal of such Standby Letter
of Credit) and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article 3 unless such Issuing Bank shall have notified the Borrower (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date for notice of termination
set forth in such Letter of Credit (but in any event at least thirty (30)
Business Days prior to the date of automatic renewal) of its election not to

the terms of each Standby Letter of Credit that is automatically renewable
annually shall not permit the expiration date (after giving effect to any
renewal) of such Standby Letter of Credit in any event to be extended to a date
later than thirty (30) days before the Revolving Credit Termination Date. If

to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day
funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing in accordance with the

the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the


                                      -38-
<PAGE>
Borrower by crediting the Borrower's Account; provided, however, that in the
case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall first
make a portion of such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of Letter
of Credit Advances made by the applicable Issuing Bank and by any other
Revolving Credit Lender and outstanding on the date of such Revolving Credit
Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of such date,
available to the applicable Issuing Bank and such other Revolving Credit Lenders
for repayment of Letter of Credit Advances.

        (b) Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made either (x) on notice, given
not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date of the proposed Swing Line
Borrowing, by the Borrower to the Swing Line Bank and the Administrative Agent
or (y) pursuant to other arrangements, including, by way of example and not of
limitation, arrangements for daily repayments and borrowings on each Business
Day, which are satisfactory in form and substance to the Swing Line Bank, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Each notice of a Swing Line Borrowing
pursuant to clause (x) in the immediately preceding sentence (a "Notice of Swing
Line Borrowing") may be by telephone, confirmed promptly in writing, or telex or
telecopier, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii)
amount of such Borrowing and (iii) maturity of such Borrowing (which maturity
shall be no later than the seventh day after the requested date of such
Borrowing). The Swing Line Bank will make the amount of a requested Swing Line
Advance available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
Account, in same day funds. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such
funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3,
the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower by
crediting the Borrower's Account. Upon written demand by the Swing Line Bank,
with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each other Revolving
Credit Lender shall purchase from the Swing Line Bank, and the Swing Line Bank
shall sell and assign to each such other Revolving Credit Lender, such other
Lender's Pro Rata Share of all outstanding Swing Line Advances as of the date of
such demand, by deposit to the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day
funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of
Swing Line Advances to be purchased by such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees
to each such sale and assignment. Each Revolving Credit Lender agrees to
purchase its Pro Rata Share of outstanding Swing Line Advances on (i) the
Business Day on which demand therefor is made by the Swing Line Bank; provided
that notice of such demand is given not later than 12:00 P.M. (New York time) on
such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if
notice of such demand is given after such time. Upon any such assignment by the
Swing Line Bank to any other Revolving Credit Lender of a portion of a Swing
Line Advance, the Swing Line Bank represents and warrants to such other Lender
that the Swing Line Bank is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest
being assigned by it, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes
no responsibility with respect to such Swing Line Advance, the Loan Documents or
any Loan Party. If and to the extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall not
have so made the amount of such Swing Line Advance available to the
Administrative Agent, such Revolving Credit Lender agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent,


                                      -39-
<PAGE>
for the account of the Swing Line Bank, forthwith on demand such amount together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by the Swing Line
Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the
Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such
amount for the account of the Swing Line Bank on any Business Day, such amount
so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by
such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the
outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by the Swing Line
Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

        (c) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding,
(i) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances if the obligation of
the appropriate Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be suspended
pursuant to Section 2.9 or Section 2.10, and (ii) the Eurodollar Rate Advances
made on any date may not be outstanding as part of more than twelve (12)
separate Borrowings.

        (d) Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Swing Line Borrowing shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the
related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each appropriate Lender against any loss,
cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on
or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the
applicable conditions set forth in Article 3, including, without limitation, any
loss (including, without limitation, a return on such liquidation or deployment
that would result in such Lender receiving less than it would have received had
such Advances remained outstanding until the last day of the Interest Period),
cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made
by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such
failure, is not made on such date.

        (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from an
appropriate Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing under a Facility under
which such Lender has a Commitment that such Lender will not make available to
the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 2.2 and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so
made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and
the Borrower severally agree to repay or pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount and to pay interest thereon, for
each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the
date such amount is repaid or paid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the
case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at such time under Section
2.7 to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender,
the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall


                                      -40-
<PAGE>
pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid
shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for all
purposes.

        (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as
part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to
be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

        SECTION 2.3 Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters of
Credit.

        (a) Request for Issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon
notice, given not later than 3:00 P.M. (New York time) on the fifth Business Day
prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of Credit, by the
Borrower to an Issuing Bank, which shall give to the Administrative Agent and
each Revolving Credit Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or telecopier. Each
such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "Notice of Issuance") may be by
telephone, confirmed promptly in writing, or telex or telecopier, specifying
therein the requested (i) date of such issuance (which shall be a Business Day),
(ii) Available Amount of such Letter of Credit, (iii) expiration date of such
Letter of Credit, (iv) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of
Credit and (v) form of such Letter of Credit, and shall be accompanied by such
application and agreement for letter of credit as such Issuing Bank may specify
to the Borrower for use in connection with such requested Letter of Credit (a
"Letter of Credit Agreement"). If the requested form of such Letter of Credit is
acceptable to such Issuing Bank, in its sole discretion, such Issuing Bank will,
upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3, make such
Letter of Credit available to the Borrower at its office referred to in Section
11.2 or as otherwise agreed with the Borrower in connection with such issuance.
In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any such Letter of Credit
Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall govern.

        (b) Letter of Credit Reports. Each Issuing Bank shall furnish (i) to the
Administrative Agent on the first Business Day of each week a written report
summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued during the
previous week and drawings during such week under all Letters of Credit, (ii) to
the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Revolving Credit Lender on the
first Business Day of each month a written report summarizing issuance and
expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued during the preceding month and
drawings during such month under all Letters of Credit and (iii) to the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Revolving Credit Lender on the first
Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth the average
daily aggregate Available Amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all
Letters of Credit.

        (c) Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by an Issuing Bank of a draft
drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all purposes of this
Agreement the making by such Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit Advance which
shall be a Prime Rate Advance in the amount


                                      -41-
<PAGE>
of such draft. Each of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Revolving
Credit Lender hereby acknowledges and agrees that Letter of Credit Advances may
be made, or deemed made, by any Issuing Bank in respect of any Letter of Credit
and to participate in all Letter of Credit Advances made hereunder as provided
herein. The Borrower shall reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for each Letter
of Credit Advance, using its own funds or the proceeds of a Revolving Credit
Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing on the same Business Day on which such Letter
of Credit is drawn. To the extent the Borrower does not so reimburse the
applicable Issuing Bank, upon written demand by such Issuing Bank, with a copy
of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each Revolving Credit Lender shall
purchase from such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall sell and assign to
each such Revolving Credit Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
outstanding Letter of Credit Advance as of the date of such purchase, by making
available (for the account of its Applicable Lending Office) to the
Administrative Agent (for the account of such Issuing Bank), by deposit to the
Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the
portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Letter of Credit Advance to
be purchased by such Lender. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative
Agent shall transfer such funds to the applicable Issuing Bank. The Borrower
hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Revolving Credit Lender
agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Letter of Credit Advance
on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by the applicable
Issuing Bank; provided that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00
A.M. (New York time) on such Business Day or (ii) the first Business Day next
succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. Upon
any such assignment by the applicable Issuing Bank to any other Revolving Credit
Lender of a portion of a Letter of Credit Advance, such Issuing Bank represents
and warrants to such other Lender that such Issuing Bank is the legal and
beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, free and clear of any
Liens, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to such Letter of Credit Advance, the Loan Documents
or any Loan Party. If and to the extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall
not have so made the amount of such Letter of Credit Advance available to the
Administrative Agent, such Revolving Credit Lender agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date of demand by the applicable Issuing Bank
until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal
Funds Rate for its account or the account of such Issuing Bank, as applicable.
If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the account
of the applicable Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in
respect of principal shall constitute a Letter of Credit Advance made by such
Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding
principal amount of the Letter of Credit Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall
be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

        (d) Failure to Make Letter of Credit Advances. The failure of any Lender
to make any Letter of Credit Advance to be made by it on the date specified in
Section 2.3(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to
make its Letter of Credit Advance on such


                                      -42-
<PAGE>
date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to
make the Letter of Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.

        (e) Outstanding Letters of Credit. The letters of credit set forth under
the caption "Letters of Credit Outstanding on the Closing Date" on Schedule
2.3(e) annexed hereto and made a part hereof were issued pursuant to the
Existing Credit Agreement and which remain outstanding as of the Closing Date
(the "Outstanding Letters of Credit"). The Borrower, each Issuing Bank and each
of the Lenders hereby agree with respect to the Outstanding Letters of Credit
that such Outstanding Letters of Credit, for all purposes under this Agreement
shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit governed by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. Each Lender agrees to participate in each Outstanding Letter of
Credit issued by any Issuing Bank in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of
the face amount of such Outstanding Letter of Credit.

        SECTION 2.4 Repayment of Advances.

        (a) Term A Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative
Agent for the ratable account of the Term A Lenders the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Term A Advances on the following dates in the amounts
indicated (which amounts shall be reduced as a result of the application of
prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Section 2.6):

unused portion of the Unused


                                      -45-
<PAGE>
Revolving Credit Commitments; provided, however, that each partial reduction of
such Facility (i) shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) shall be made ratably among
the appropriate Lenders in accordance with their Commitments with respect to
such Facility. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each of the
Revolving Lenders of any termination or reduction in the Unused Revolving Credit
Commitments pursuant to the preceding sentence.

        (b) Mandatory. (i) The Term A Commitments of the Term A Lenders shall
automatically and permanently terminate and shall be of no further force and
effect on the Closing Date after the Term A Borrowing has been made by the Term
A Lenders.

               (ii) The Term B Commitments of the Term B Lenders shall
automatically and permanently terminate and shall be of no further force and
effect on the Closing Date after the Term B Borrowing has been made by the Term

Advances shall have been repaid in full, the Revolving Credit Facility shall be
automatically and permanently reduced on each date on which prepayment thereof
is required to be made pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(ii), (iii), or (v) in an
amount equal to the applicable Reduction Amount, provided that each such
reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be made ratably among the
Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitments.

               (iv) The Letter of Credit Facility shall be permanently reduced
from time to time on the date of each reduction in the Revolving Credit Facility

exceeds the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to such reduction of
the Revolving Credit Facility.

               (v) In the event the Closing Date shall not have occurred by the
close of business on May 31, 2002 then all of the Commitments shall be
automatically terminated and this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect.

        SECTION 2.6   Prepayments.

        (a) Optional. The Borrower may, without premium or penalty, upon at
least one (1) Business Day's notice in the case of Prime Rate Advances and three
(3) Business Days' notice in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case
to the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given, the Borrower shall,
prepay the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Advances, in whole or
ratably in part, together, in the case of Term A Advances and Term B Advances,
with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the aggregate principal
amount prepaid; provided, however, that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in
an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $100,000
in excess thereof and (ii) no such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance shall
be made other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor


                                      -46-
<PAGE>
without payment by the Borrower of the amounts provided for in Section 11.4(c).
Each prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.6(a) shall be applied to repay
those Facilities designated by the Borrower and unless otherwise designated by
the Borrower with respect to such Facilities, such prepayment shall be applied
first to the payment of Prime Rate Advances and second to the payment of
Eurodollar Rate Advances; provided, that if the Borrower designates that any
prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.6(a) is to be applied to the Term
Facilities, such prepayment shall be applied ratably to the Term A Facility and
the Term B Facility, and ratably to each unpaid installment of principal of each
of the Term Facilities. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds
are on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, such funds shall be applied
to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Credit Lenders, as
applicable.

        (b) Mandatory. (i) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the
end of each Fiscal Year, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower's Chief Executive Officer or
Chief Financial Officer demonstrating its calculation of Excess Cash Flow for
such Fiscal Year (except that in the case of Fiscal Year 2002, such calculation
shall be made for the period from the Business Day immediately following the
Closing Date through the end of such Fiscal Year) along with a prepayment of the
then outstanding Advances equal to fifty percent (50%) of the annual Excess Cash
Flow if the ratio of Consolidated Funded Debt to EBITDA at the end of such
Fiscal Year equals or is greater than 2.50:1; provided, however, that if the
ratio of Consolidated Funded Debt to EBITDA, measured at the end of such Fiscal
Year of the Borrower (after giving pro forma effect to making of such
prepayment), for such Fiscal Year of the Borrower, is less than 2.50:1, then the
required prepayment of the then outstanding Advances shall be in the amount of
twenty-five percent (25%) of the annual Excess Cash Flow.

               (ii) Within five (5) days after receipt by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Dispositions, unless such
proceeds may be reinvested in accordance with the definition of "Asset
Disposition," the Borrower shall prepay the then outstanding Advances in an
amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds in excess
of $2,000,000 in any Fiscal Year. In the event that such Net Cash Proceeds have
been reinvested in accordance with the definition of "Asset Disposition" and
were not used within such one hundred eighty (180) day period as required
thereby, then Borrower shall, on the first Business Day after such one hundred
eighty (180) day period, prepay the then outstanding Advances in an amount equal
to the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds which have not been so reinvested.

               (iii) Within five (5) days after receipt by the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from any Debt Issuance, the Borrower
shall prepay the then outstanding Advances in an amount equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds.

               (iv) Within five (5) days after receipt by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from any Equity Issuance, fifty percent
(50%), of such Net Cash Proceeds; provided, that the Borrower may retain an
amount up to one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds to the extent
that (x) such Net Cash Proceeds are derived from a Qualified Initial Public
Offering or from a subsequent Public Offering of common shares by the Borrower
to redeem its series B redeemable preferred stock (including accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon) and (y) after giving effect to such transaction, the ratio of
Consolidated Funded Debt to EBITDA is equal to or less than 3.00 to 1.00.
Concurrently with the consummation of such transaction the proviso set forth in
Section 8.1 shall be in effect.

               (v) Within five (5) days after receipt of Net Cash Proceeds by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries from any Extraordinary Receipt received
by or paid to or for the account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and
not otherwise included in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, unless the Borrower
or such Subsidiary intends in good faith to reinvest such proceeds in accordance
with the definition of "Extraordinary Receipt," the Borrower shall prepay the
then outstanding Advances in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
such Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $2,000,000 in any Fiscal Year.

        (vi) Each prepayment made pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (v) shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 11.4(c) and shall be applied to prepay the
Facilities in the following manner: first, ratably to the Term A Facility and
the Term B Facility, and ratably to each unpaid installment of principal of each
of the Term Facilities until such installments are paid in full; second, to
prepay Swing Line Advances then outstanding until such Advances are paid in
full; third, to prepay Revolving Credit Advances and Letter of Credit Advances
then outstanding (whereupon the Revolving Credit Facility shall be permanently
reduced as set forth in Section 2.5(b)(iv) in the amount of such prepayment)
until such Revolving Credit Advances are paid in full; and fourth, deposited in
the L/C Cash Collateral Account to cash collateralize 100% of the Available
Amount of the Letters of Credit then outstanding and within any of the foregoing
Facilities, unless otherwise designated by the Borrower, such prepayments shall
be applied first to the payment of Prime Rate Advances and second to the payment
of Eurodollar Rate Advances. Each prepayment made pursuant to clause (i) or (iv)
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 11.4(c) and shall be applied to
prepay the Term A Facility and the Term B Facility on a ratable basis, and
ratably to each unpaid installment of principal of each of the Term Facilities
until such installments are paid in full. Upon the drawing of any Letter of
Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, such
funds shall be applied to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving
Credit Lenders, as applicable. The amount remaining (if any) after the required
prepayment of the Advances then outstanding and the 100% cash collateralization
of the aggregate Available Amount of Letters of Credit then outstanding (the sum
of such prepayment amounts, cash collateralization amounts and remaining amount
being referred to herein as the "Reduction Amount") may be retained by the
Borrower. Upon the termination of all of the Commitments and the final payment
in full of all Obligations, including, without limitation, termination or
expiration of all Letters of Credit and the final


                                      -48-
<PAGE>
payment in full of all Obligations in respect of all Letters of Credit, then all
amounts remaining on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account shall be
returned to the Borrower.

               (vii) The Borrower shall, within fifteen (15) days following the
end of each month in each Fiscal Year, pay to the Administrative Agent for
deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account an amount sufficient to cause the
aggregate amount on deposit in such Account to equal the amount by which the
aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds the
Letter of Credit Facility on such Business Day.

               (viii) At any time that the aggregate amount of Revolving Credit
Advances, Letter of Credit Advances, Swing Line Advances and the aggregate
Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, in each case outstanding, exceeds the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Borrower shall immediately repay Revolving Credit
Advances to the extent necessary to reduce the principal balance of Revolving
Credit Borrowings to an amount equal to or less than the Revolving Credit
Facility.

               (ix) The foregoing notwithstanding, the provisions of this
Section 2.6(b) shall not be construed to permit any Equity Issuance, Debt
Issuance or Asset Disposition otherwise prohibited under the terms of this
Agreement.

        (c) Application of Prepayments to the Term A Facility and the Term B
Facility. Upon receipt of any amounts to be applied to the prepayment in respect
of the Term A Facility and the Term B Facility pursuant to this Section 2.6, the
Administrative Agent shall apply such amounts to the prepayment of the Term A
Advances and Term B Advances ratably; provided, however, that the Borrower may,
by providing not less than six (6) Business Days prior notice to the
Administrative Agent, offer the Term B Lenders the option to decline to accept
any prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.6(b), and, if within five (5)
Business Days of receiving a copy of such notice from the Administrative Agent,
any Term B Lender notifies the Administrative Agent that it elects to refuse to
accept the prepayment of its Term B Advances, the Administrative Agent shall
apply the portion of such prepayment that would have been allocated to the
repayment of such Lender's Term B Advances, to the prepayment of the Advances of
the Lenders under the Term A Facility (to the extent that there are Term A
Advances then outstanding) and of the Advances of the Term B Lenders which have
not so refused ratably to each unpaid installment of principal of each such
Facility (and, if all Lenders under the Term B Facility elect to refuse their
ratable share of such prepayment, only to the Advances of the Lenders under the
Term A Facility, to the extent that there are Term A Advances then outstanding).
If any Term B Lender shall not give notice to the Administrative Agent within
such five (5) Business Day period, the Administrative Agent shall assume that
such Lender shall have accepted such prepayment.

        SECTION 2.7   Interest.

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

        (a) Scheduled Interest. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative

principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

               (i) Prime Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is a
Prime Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (x) the

on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a
duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest
Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the
date such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

        (b) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall
pay interest on any Advance and all other amounts then outstanding under the
Facilities at the applicable Post-Default Rate (to the extent permitted by law)
whenever an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (i) under Section
9.1 for the period commencing on the occurrence of such Event of Default until
such Event of Default has been cured or waived as acknowledged in writing by the
Administrative Agent and (ii) under any Section contained in Article 9 (other
than Section 9.1) for the period commencing on the sixty-first day after the
occurrence of such Event of Default (if not then cured or waived) until such
Event of Default has been cured or waived as acknowledged in writing by the
Administrative Agent.

        (c) Notice of Interest Rate. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of
Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2(a), the Administrative Agent shall give notice
to the Borrower and each appropriate Lender of the applicable interest rate
determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of clause (a)(i) or (ii).

        SECTION 2.8   Fees.

        (a) Commitment Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of the Lenders (other than Defaulting Lenders), commitment fees,
from the Closing Date in the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective
date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a
Lender in the case of each other Lender, until the Revolving Credit Termination

                                      -50-
<PAGE>
Unused Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender. For purposes of this
subsection (a), Swing Line Advances shall not constitute utilization of the
Revolving Credit Commitments of the Revolving Credit Lenders (other than the
Lender Parties which have made the Swing Line Advances).

        (b) Letter of Credit Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender a
commission, payable in arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December, commencing June 28, 2002 and on the earliest to
occur of the full drawing, expiration, termination or cancellation of any such
Letter of Credit and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date, on such Lender's
Pro Rata Share of the average daily aggregate Available Amount during such
quarter of all Letters of Credit outstanding from time to time at the rate per
annum equal to (x) the Applicable Margin then in effect for Eurodollar Advances
under the Revolving Credit Facility with respect to Standby Letters of Credit
and (y) 50% of the Applicable Margin then in effect for Eurodollar Advances
under the Revolving Credit Facility with respect to Trade Letters of Credit.

               (ii) In addition to the foregoing fees described in (i) above,
the Borrower shall pay to the applicable Issuing Bank, for its own account, (x)
on the Available Amount of each Letter of Credit, a fronting fee, for the period
from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including the
termination thereof, computed at a rate equal to 0.25% thereof, which amount
shall be payable in arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December of each year and on the date of termination thereof
and (y) transfer fees and other customary fees and charges in connection with
the issuance or administration of each Letter of Credit as the Borrower and the
applicable Issuing Bank shall agree.

        (c) Administrative Agent's Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for its own account such fees as may from time to time be
agreed between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, including pursuant to
the Fee Letter.

        SECTION 2.9 Conversion of Advances.

        (a) Optional. The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to
the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York time) on the third
Business Day prior to the date of a proposed Conversion of Advances into
Eurodollar Rate Advances and on the Business Day prior to the date of a proposed
conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Prime Rate Advances, and subject to
the provisions of Sections 2.7 and 2.10, Convert all or any portion of the
Advances of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances of the other
Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into
Prime Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Rate Advances unless the Borrower pays the amounts, if any,
provided for in Section 11.4(c), any Conversion of Prime Rate Advances into
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount
specified in Section 2.1(c), no Conversion of any Advances shall result in

                                      -51-
<PAGE>
more separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.2(c) and each Conversion
of Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing under any Facility shall be
made ratably among the appropriate Lenders in accordance with their Commitments
under such Facility. Each such notice of Conversion shall, within the
restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the
Advances to be Converted and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for such Advances. Each
notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

        (b) Mandatory. (i) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by
payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $500,000, such Advances shall
automatically Convert into Prime Rate Advances.

               (ii) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any
Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.1, the
Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the appropriate
Lenders, whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Prime
Rate Advance.

               (iii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event
of Default and the acceleration of the Notes, interest thereon and other amounts
payable by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
pursuant to Article 9, (x) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on
the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Prime
Rate Advance and (y) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert
Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

        SECTION 2.10  Increased Costs, Etc.

        (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in reserve
requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage, or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation, or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make or of making, funding or
maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances (excluding for purposes of this Section
2.10 any such increased costs resulting from (x) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to
which Section 2.12 shall govern) and (y) changes in the basis of taxation of
overall net income or profit or overall gross income by the United States or by
the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender Party is
organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision
thereof), then, subject to Section 11.4(f), the Borrower shall from time to
time, within five (5) days after demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of
such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender Party additional amounts sufficient to compensate
such Lender Party for such increased cost (except to the extent already
reflected in


                                      -52-
<PAGE>
the definition of Eurodollar Rate); provided, however, that a Lender Party
claiming additional amounts under this Section 2.10(a) agrees to use reasonable
efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making
of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
increased cost that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender
Party. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such increased cost, submitted to
the Borrower by such Lender Party, shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

        (b) If, due to the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any
central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of
law), there shall be any increase in the amount of capital required or
reasonably expected to be maintained by any Lender Party or any corporation
controlling such Lender Party as a result of or based upon the existence of such
Lender Party's commitment to lend or to issue Letters of Credit hereunder or the
issuance or maintenance of the Letters of Credit (or similar contingent
obligations), then, within five (5) days after demand by such Lender Party (with
a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party, from time to time
as specified by such Lender Party, additional amounts sufficient to compensate
such Lender Party in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such
Lender Party reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to
the existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or to issue Letters of
Credit hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance of any Letters of Credit. A
certificate as to such amounts setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
calculation of such amounts submitted to the Borrower by such Lender Party shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

        (c) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances under any Facility,
Lenders owed greater than 50% of the then aggregate unpaid principal amount
thereof notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any
Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such
Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Eurodollar Rate Advances for
such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the
Borrower and the appropriate Lenders, whereupon (i) each such Eurodollar Rate
Advance under any Facility will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Prime Rate Advance and (ii)
the obligation of the appropriate Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into,
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall
notify the Borrower that such Lenders have determined that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist.

        (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its


                                      -53-
<PAGE>
Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender
to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) each Eurodollar Rate
Advance under each Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment will
automatically, at the end of such applicable Interest Periods (or sooner if
required by law), Convert into a Prime Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of
the appropriate Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that before making any such
demand, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different
Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a designation would allow such
Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations
to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to find or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Advances and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, result in an
economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage to such Lender.

        SECTION 2.11 Payments and Computations.

        (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes,
irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise
provided in Section 2.15), not later than 12:00 P.M. (New York time) on the day
when due in U.S. dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Account in same day funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly
thereafter cause like funds to be distributed (i) if such payment by the
Borrower is in respect of principal, interest, commitment fees or any other
Obligation then payable hereunder and under the Notes to more than one Lender
Party, to such Lender Parties for the account of their respective Applicable
Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the amounts of such respective
Obligations then payable to such Lender Parties and (ii) if such payment by the
Borrower is in respect of any Obligation then payable hereunder to one Lender
Party, to such Lender Party for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in
each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its
acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 11.7(d), from and after
the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent
shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest
assigned thereby to the Lender Party assignee thereunder, and the parties to
such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

        (b) If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the
Obligations under the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan
Documents do not specify the Advances or the Facility to which, or the manner in
which, such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent shall distribute
such funds to each Lender Party ratably in accordance with such Lender Party's
proportionate share of the principal amount of all outstanding Advances and


                                      -54-
<PAGE>
the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding in repayment or
prepayment of such of the outstanding Advances or other Obligations owed to such
Lender Party, and for application to such principal installments, as the
Administrative Agent shall direct.

        (c) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender Party, if and to the
extent payment owed to such Lender Party is not made when due hereunder (after
giving effect to applicable grace periods, if any) or, in the case of a Lender,
under the Note held by such Lender, to charge from time to time against any or
all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender Party any amount so due.

        (d) Interest, fees and Letter of Credit commissions shall be computed by
the Administrative Agent on the basis of the actual number of days (including
the first day but excluding the last day) elapsed over a year of 360 days;
provided, that interest on all Prime Rate Advances shall be computed on the
basis of the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the
last day) elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate, fee or commission
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

        (e) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to
be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as the
case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of
interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next
following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.

        (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender Party
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender Party
on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender Party. If
and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to
the Administrative Agent, each such Lender Party shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

        SECTION 2.12  Taxes.

        (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes
shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in
the case of each Lender Party and the Administrative Agent,


                                      -55-
<PAGE>
net income taxes that are imposed by the United States and net income taxes (or
franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof) that are imposed on such Lender Party
or the Administrative Agent by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws
of which such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is
organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender
Party, net income taxes (or franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof) that are
imposed on such Lender Party by the state or foreign jurisdiction of such Lender
Party's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any
Note to any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall
be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
2.12) such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the
Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority
or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

        (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future stamp,
documentary, excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies that arise
from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to,
this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

        (c) The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender Party and the
Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes, and for the
full amount of taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.12, imposed on or paid by such Lender Party or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, additions to
tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, except
with respect to any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may
be, for such a liability arising from such Lender Party's or the Administrative
Agent's, as the case may be, willful misconduct or gross negligence. This
indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date such Lender
Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand
specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor.

        (d) Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment by the
Borrower of Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at
its address referred to in Section 11.2, the original receipt of payment thereof
or a certified copy of such receipt.

        (e) Each Lender Party that is not a United States Person shall, on or
prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of
each Initial Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and on the date of the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender Party in the case
of each other Lender Party, and from time to time thereafter


                                      -56-
<PAGE>
as requested in writing by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (but only so
long thereafter as such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), provide
each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower with two (2) original Internal
Revenue Service forms W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as appropriate, or any successor
or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, the Internal Revenue
Code or the Treasury Regulations thereunder, certifying that such Lender is
exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes. In addition, each Lender Party
shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any
form previously delivered by such Lender Party. Each Lender Party shall promptly
notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position
to provide any previously delivered certificates to the Borrower (or any other
form of certification adopted by the United States taxing authorities for such
purpose). If the forms provided by a Lender Party at the time such Lender Party
first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest
withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be
considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender Party provides the
appropriate form certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding
tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods
governed by such form; provided, however, that, if at the date of the Assignment
and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party becomes a party to this
Agreement, the Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under subsection
(a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at
such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to
withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise
includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with
respect to the Lender Party assignee on such date. If any form or document
referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other
than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required
on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY,
that the Lender Party reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender Party
shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include
in such form or document such confidential information. For purposes of this
subsection (e), the terms "United States" and "United States Person" shall have
the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

        (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender Party has failed to
provide the Borrower with the appropriate form described in subsection (e)
(other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring after the date
on which a form originally was required to be provided or if such form otherwise
is not required under subsection (e)), such Lender Party shall not be entitled
to indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by
the United States by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a
Lender Party become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form
required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender Party
shall reasonably request to assist such Lender Party to recover such Taxes.

        (g) Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.12 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its
Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter
accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party.

        (h) Each Lender Party shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do
so, deliver to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
such other forms or similar documentation as may be required from time to time
by any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation in order to establish such
Lender Party's complete exemption from withholding on all payments under this
Agreement or the Notes.

        SECTION 2.13 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender Party shall obtain
at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of
any right of set-off, or otherwise) (i) on account of Obligations due and
payable to such Lender Party hereunder or under the Notes at such time in excess
of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the amount of such
Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party at such time to (y) the
aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties
hereunder and under the Notes at such time) of payments on account of the
Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties hereunder or under the Notes
at such time obtained by all the Lender Parties at such time or (ii) on account
of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender Party hereunder
and under the Notes at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to
the proportion of (x) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Lender Party
at such time to (y) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due
and payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time)
of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all
Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time obtained by all of the
Lender Parties at such time, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the
other Lender Parties such participations in the Obligations due and payable or
owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender Party to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such purchase from each
other Lender Party shall be rescinded and each such other Lender Party shall
repay to the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of such
Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the purchase
price paid to such Lender Party to (y) the aggregate purchase price paid to all
Lender Parties) of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender
Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the amount of such
other Lender Party's required repayment to (y) the total amount of such required
repayments to the purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid
or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so
recovered.

The Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so purchasing a participation from
another Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its


                                      -58-
<PAGE>
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender Party were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

        SECTION 2.14 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances and issuances
of Letters of Credit shall be available, and the Borrower shall use such
proceeds and Letters of Credit solely (a) with respect to the Term Advances, to
(i) finance the Spectrum Acquisition and to repay existing indebtedness and (ii)
pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Spectrum Acquisition in an
amount not to exceed $7,000,000, and (b) with respect to the Revolving Credit
Advances, to finance (i) working capital, (ii) general corporate purposes of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and (iii) Permitted Acquisitions.

        SECTION 2.15 Defaulting Lenders. (a) In the event that, at any one time,
(i) any Lender Party shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender
shall owe a Defaulted Advance to the Borrower and (iii) the Borrower shall be
required to make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to or
for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, so long as no
Default shall occur or be continuing at such time and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, set off and otherwise apply the obligation of the
Borrower to make such payment to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender
against the obligation of such Defaulting Lender to make such Defaulted Advance.
In the event that, on any date, the Borrower shall so set off and otherwise
apply its obligation to make any such payment against the obligation of such
Defaulting Lender to make any such Defaulted Advance on or prior to such date,
the amount so set off and otherwise applied by the Borrower shall constitute for
all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents an Advance by such
Defaulting Lender made on the date under the Facility pursuant to which such
Defaulted Advance was originally required to have been made pursuant to Section
2.1. Such Advance shall be a Prime Rate Advance and shall be considered, for all
purposes of this Agreement, to comprise part of the Borrowing in connection with
which such Defaulted Advance was originally required to have been made pursuant
to Section 2.1, even if the other Advances comprising such Borrowing shall be
Eurodollar Rate Advances on the date such Advance is deemed to be made pursuant
to this subsection (a). The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent at
any time the Borrower exercises its right of set-off pursuant to this subsection
(a) and shall set forth in such notice (i) the name of the Defaulting Lender and
the Defaulted Advance required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and (ii) the
amount set off and otherwise applied in respect of such Defaulted Advance
pursuant to this subsection (a). Any portion of such payment otherwise required
to be made by the Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender which
is paid by the Borrower, after giving effect to the amount set off and otherwise
applied by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection (a), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 2.15.

        (b) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender Party shall be a
Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a Defaulted Amount to
the Administrative Agent or any of the other Lender Parties and (iii) the
Borrower shall make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting


                                      -59-
<PAGE>
Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, on its behalf or on behalf of such
other Lender Parties and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
apply at such time the amount so paid by the Borrower to or for the account of
such Defaulting Lender to the payment of each such Defaulted Amount to the
extent required to pay such Defaulted Amount. In the event that the
Administrative Agent shall so apply any such amount to the payment of any such
Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount so applied by the Administrative Agent
shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, payment, to such extent, of such Defaulted Amount on such date. Any
such amount so applied by the Administrative Agent shall be retained by the
Administrative Agent or distributed by the Administrative Agent to such other
Lender Parties, ratably in accordance with the respective portions of such
Defaulted Amounts payable at such time to the Administrative Agent and such
other Lender Parties and, if the amount of such payment made by the Borrower
shall at such time be insufficient to pay all Defaulted Amounts owing at such
time to the Administrative Agent and the other Lender Parties, in the following
order of priority:

              (i) first, to the Administrative Agent for any Defaulted Amount
then owing to the Administrative Agent (in its capacity of such); and

              (ii) second, to the Lender Parties for any Defaulted Amounts then
owing to such Lender Parties, ratably in accordance with such respective
Defaulted Amounts then owing to such Lender Parties.

Any portion of such amount paid by the Borrower for the account of such
Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (b), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (c) of this Section 2.15.

        (c) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender Party shall be a
Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not owe a Defaulted Advance
or a Defaulted Amount and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender Party shall be required to pay or distribute any amount hereunder
or under any other Loan Document to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender, then the Borrower or such other Lender Party shall pay such amount to
the Administrative Agent to be held by the Administrative Agent, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, in escrow or the Administrative Agent shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hold in escrow such amount
otherwise held by it. Any funds held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under
this subsection (c) shall be deposited by the Administrative Agent in an account
with Fleet, in the name and under the control of the Administrative Agent, but
subject to the provisions of this subsection (c). The terms applicable to such
account, including the rate of interest payable with respect to the credit
balance of such account from time to time, shall be Fleet's standard terms
applicable to escrow accounts maintained with it. Any interest credited to such
account from time to time shall be held by the Administrative Agent in escrow
under, and applied by the Administrative Agent from time to


                                      -60-
<PAGE>
time in accordance with the provisions of, this subsection (c). The
Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
apply all funds so held in escrow from time to time to the extent necessary to
make any Advances required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and to pay any
amount payable by such Defaulting Lender hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party, as and when
such Advances or amounts are required to be made or paid and, if the amount so
held in escrow shall at any time be insufficient to make and pay all such
Advances and amounts required to be made or paid at such time, in the following
order of priority:

              (i) first, to the Administrative Agent for any amount then due and
payable by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent (in its capacity
as such) hereunder;

               (ii) second, to the Lender Parties for any amount then due and
payable by such Defaulting Lender to such Lender Parties hereunder, ratably in
accordance with such respective amounts then due and payable to such Lender
Parties; and

               (iii) third, to the Borrower for any Advance then required to be
made by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to a Commitment of such Defaulting
Lender.

In the event that any Lender Party that is a Defaulting Lender shall, at any
time, cease to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds held by the Administrative
Agent in escrow at such time with respect to such Lender Party shall be
distributed by the Administrative Agent to such Lender Party and applied by such
Lender Party to the Obligations owing to such Lender Party at such time under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative
Agent shall reasonably direct.

        (d) The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this
Section 2.15 are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower may
have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Advance and
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party may have against such
Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Amount.

        SECTION 2.16 Removal of Lender. In the event that any Lender Party (an
"Affected Lender") (a) demands payment of costs or additional amounts pursuant
to Section 2.10 or Section 2.12 or (b) asserts, pursuant to Section 2.10(d) that
it is unlawful for such Affected Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Advances, then
(subject to such Affected Lender's right to rescind such demand or assertion
within ten (10) days after the notice from the Borrower referred to below and so
long as no Event of Default exists) the Borrower may, upon twenty (20) days'
prior written notice to such Affected Lender and the Administrative Agent, with
the reasonable assistance of the Administrative Agent, elect to cause such
Affected Lender to assign all of its rights and obligations under the Agreement
(including, without limitation, all of its Commitment or Commitments, the
Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) to an Eligible Assignee
selected by the Borrower which is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent, so long as such Affected Lender receives payment in full in cash of the
outstanding principal


                                      -61-
<PAGE>
amount of all Advances made by it and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
and all other amounts due and payable to such Affected Lender as of the
effective date of such assignment (including, without limitation, amounts owing
to such Affected Lender pursuant to Section 2.3, 2.4, 2.7, 2.8, 2.10 or 2.12)
and in such case such Affected Lender agrees to make such assignment, and such
assignee shall agree to accept such assignment and assume all the obligations of
such Affected Lender hereunder, in accordance with Section 11.7. Until the
consummation of an assignment in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.16, the Borrower shall continue to pay to the Affected Lender any
Obligations as they become due and payable.

Debt (as such terms are defined in the Security Agreement and the Holdings
Pledge Agreement) pledged under such agreements, subject to no security
interests of any other Person other than Permitted Liens and unperfected Liens

authorizations, franchises, certificates, and inspections of all Regulatory
Agencies and are otherwise necessary for such Loan Party to continue to conduct
business and own, use, operate, and maintain its property and assets as
heretofore conducted, owned, used, operated, and maintained which, if not
obtained (whether directly or by lawful and effective assignment) or not
maintained in good standing, would have a Material Adverse Effect. No such
approval, permit, license, consent, authorization, franchise, or certificate is
conditioned or limited (in any material respect) any more so than as is
generally the case with respect to Persons engaged in the same or similar lines
of business. Each such approval, permit, license, consent, authorization,
franchise, or certificate was duly and validly granted or issued, is in full

notice or lapse of time or both, could result in the amendment, modification,
suspension, rescission, revocation, forfeiture, or non-renewal of any such
approval, permit, license, consent, authorization, franchise, or certificate.

licensed and certified (as and where required) by each regulatory body having
jurisdiction over services rendered by such Person, and (ii) eligible (as and
where required) to participate in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and

aggregate.

Schedule I), and any representation or warranty contained herein which refers to
any such Schedule shall from and after the date of any such amendment refer to
such Schedule as so supplemented or amended; provided, however, that in no event
shall any such supplemented or amended disclosure cure any existing Default or
Event of Default.

governmental office, any document or instrument reasonably deemed by the
Administrative Agent to be necessary or desirable for the creation and

Collateral and to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent and to the
extent the value of such Collateral exceeds $1,000,000 and use reasonable
efforts to obtain a landlord waiver or bailee letter, in form and substance

any real property of the Borrower which is subject to a mortgage or other Lien
and to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, use reasonable efforts
to obtain a mortgagee waiver, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, from the holder of each mortgage or other Lien on such
real property; and (vii) to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this

Section shall be granted pursuant to the Collateral Documents or, in the
Administrative Agent's discretion, such other security documentation (which
shall be substantially similar to the Collateral Documents already executed and
delivered by the Borrower and the Guarantors) as is satisfactory in form and
substance to the Administrative Agent (the "Additional Collateral Documents")
and shall constitute valid and enforceable perfected security interests prior to
the rights of all third Persons and subject to no other Liens except Liens
permitted under Section 6.1. The Additional Collateral Documents and other
instruments related thereto shall be duly recorded or filed in such manner and
in such places and at such times as are required by law to establish, perfect,
preserve and protect the Liens, in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the Lender Parties, granted pursuant to the Additional Collateral
Documents and, all taxes, fees and other charges payable in connection therewith

documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the
Required Lenders to assure themselves that this Section has been complied with.

then, and in any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall at the request,
or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrower,
declare the Commitments of each appropriate Lender (other than the Commitment in
respect of Letter of Credit Advances by an Issuing Bank or a Revolving Credit
Lender pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and Swing Line Advances by a Revolving Credit
Lender pursuant to Section 2.2(b)) and of each Issuing Bank to issue Letters of
Credit to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate; (ii)
shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, (A) by
notice to the Borrower, declare the Notes, all interest thereon and all other
amounts payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to be
forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Notes, all such interest and all such
other amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by the Borrower and (B) by notice to each party required
under the terms of any agreement in support of which a Standby Letter of Credit
is issued, request that all Obligations under such agreement be declared to be
due and payable; provided, however, that in the event of an actual or deemed
entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (x) the obligation of each
Lender to make Advances (other than Letter of Credit Advances by an Issuing Bank
or a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and Swing Line Advances
by a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.2(b)) and of each Issuing
Bank to issue Letters of Credit shall automatically be terminated and (y) the
Notes, all such interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and be
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; and (iii) exercise any
other remedy available under the Loan Documents or applicable law.

If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders,
irrespective of whether it is taking any of the actions described in Article 9

the Borrower will, pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lender
Parties in same day funds at the Administrative Agent's office designated in
such demand, for deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to
the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding. If at
any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held in the L/C Cash
Collateral Account are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than
the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties or that the total amount of such
funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, the
Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the
Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C
Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate
Available Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in the
L/C Cash Collateral Account that the Administrative Agent determines to be free
and clear of any such right and claim.

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         SECTION 10.1 Authorization and Action. Each Lender Party (in its
capacities as a Lender, each Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Bank and any Hedge
Bank) hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers
and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation,
enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be
required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to
act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lender Parties and all holders of Notes;
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take
any action that exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or that
is contrary to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or applicable law. The
Administrative Agent agrees to give to each Lender Party prompt notice of each
notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall not be a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender.

         SECTION 10.2 Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with
the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof
until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance
entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such Note, as assignor, and an
Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 11.7; (b) may consult
with legal counsel (including counsel for any Loan Party), independent public
accountants and other experts reasonably selected by it and shall not be liable
for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance
with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty
or representation to any Lender Party and shall not be responsible to any Lender
Party for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or
oral) made in or in connection with the Loan Documents; (d) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of any Loan Document on the part of any Loan
Party or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any Loan
Party; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender Party for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the
perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest created or purported to
be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; and (f) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument

or writing (which may be by telegram, telecopy or telex) believed by it to be
genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

         SECTION 10.3 Fleet and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitments, the
Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, Fleet shall have the same rights
and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender Party and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term "Lender
Party" or "Lender Parties" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include
Fleet in its individual capacity. Fleet and its affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment
banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, any
Loan Party, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or
own securities of any Loan Party or any such Subsidiary, all as if Fleet were
not the Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lender Parties.

         SECTION 10.4 Lender Party Credit Decision. Each Lender Party
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party and based on the financial
statements referred to in Section 4.6 and such other documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into this Agreement. Each Lender Party also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender Party and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.5      Indemnification.

         (a) Each Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify the Administrative
Agent (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against
such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be
imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of any of the Loan Documents or any action taken or
omitted by the Administrative Agent under any of the Loan Documents; provided,
however, that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender Party agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 11.4, to the
extent that the Administrative Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs
and expenses by the Borrower.

         (b) Each Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify each Issuing Bank
(to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against such
Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that

                                    - 112 -
<PAGE>
may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Issuing Bank in any way
relating to or arising out of any of the Loan Documents or any action taken or
omitted by such Issuing Bank under any of the Loan Documents; provided, however,
that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting from such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender Party
agrees to reimburse each Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its ratable share
of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of
counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 11.4, to the extent that such
Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the
Borrower.

         (c) For purposes of Sections 10.5(a) and 10.5(b), the Lender Parties'
respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any time,
according to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Advances
outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lender Parties, (ii) their
respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of
Credit outstanding at such time, (iii) the aggregate unused portions of their
respective Term A Commitments and Term B Commitments at such time, and (iv)
their respective Unused Revolving Credit Commitments at such time; provided,
that the aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Advances owing to the Swing
Line Bank and Letter of Credit Advances owing to the Issuing Banks shall be
considered to be owed to the Revolving Credit Lenders ratably in accordance with
their respective Revolving Credit Commitments. In the event that any Defaulted
Advance shall be owing by any Defaulting Lender at any time, such Lender Party's
Commitment with respect to the Facility under which such Defaulted Advance was
required to have been made shall be considered to be unused for purposes of this
Section 10.5 to the extent of the amount of such Defaulted Advance. The failure
of any Lender Party to reimburse the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount
required to be paid by the Lender Parties to the Administrative Agent or such
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, as provided herein shall not relieve any other
Lender Party of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Administrative Agent
or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for its ratable share of such amount,
but no Lender Party shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender
Party to reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, for such other Lender Party's ratable share of such amount. Without
prejudice to the survival of any other agreements of any Lender Party hereunder,
the agreement and obligations of each Lender Party contained in this Section
10.5 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other
amounts payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 10.6 Successor Administrative Agents. The Administrative Agent
may resign as to any or all of the Facilities at any time by giving thirty (30)
days prior written notice thereof to the Lender Parties and the Borrower and may
be removed as to all of the Facilities at any time with or without cause by the
Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent as to such of


                                    - 113 -
<PAGE>
the Facilities as to which the Administrative Agent has resigned or been removed
which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and
shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders'
removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative
Agent may, on behalf of the Lender Parties, appoint a successor Administrative
Agent, which shall be a Lender which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Borrower and which is a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of
the United States or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $1,000,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent as to all of
the Facilities and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing
statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may
be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to
continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the
Collateral Documents, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of
the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall
be discharged from all of its duties and obligations under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent as to less
than all of the Facilities and upon the execution and filing or recording of
such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or
notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may
request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported
to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor Administrative Agent
shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent as to such
Facilities, other than with respect to funds transfers and other similar aspects
of the administration of Borrowings under such Facilities, issuances of Letters
of Credit (notwithstanding any resignation as Administrative Agent with respect
to the Letter of Credit Facility) and payments by the Borrower in respect of
such Facilities which functions shall continue to be performed by the
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under this Agreement as to such Facilities,
other than as aforesaid. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent as to all of the Facilities, the
provisions of this Article 10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent as to any
Facilities under this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.7 Events of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default (other than the
non-payment of principal of or interest on Loans) unless the Administrative
Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower specifying such Default
and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the
Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders (and shall give
each Lender notice

                                    - 114 -
<PAGE>
of each such non-payment). The Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section
10.1(b) hereof) take such action with respect to such Default as shall be
directed by the Required Lenders.

             SECTION 10.8 Syndication and Documentation Agent. Each Lender, the
Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent
acknowledges that the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent, in such
capacity, shall have no duties or responsibilities, and shall incur no
liabilities, under this Agreement or other Loan Documents in their capacities as
such.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 11.1 Amendments, Etc. No amendment, modification, supplement,
termination or waiver of or to any provision of this Agreement, nor consent to

Required Lenders and the Borrower; provided, however, that no such amendment,
modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent, as the case may be,
shall, (i) reduce the rate of interest or extend the final scheduled maturity
date or the scheduled date for payment of any principal payment, Advance or Note
(other than any mandatory prepayment), or the stated maturity of any Letter of
Credit beyond the Revolving Credit Termination Date, or the date for payment of
any fees or interest on any Advance, or waive, reduce or excuse any such payment
or any part thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any Advance, or reduce
the principal amount thereof, without the prior written consent of each affected
Lender affected thereby, (ii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral
(except as expressly provided in the Collateral Documents) under the Collateral
Documents, without the prior written consent of each Lender, (iii) amend, modify
or waive any provision of this Section 11.1, without the prior written consent
of each Lender, (iv) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Lenders, without the prior written consent of each affected Lender, (v)
consent to the assignment or transfer by Borrower of any of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
Lender, or (vi) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their
respective Guaranty, without the prior written consent of each Lender; provided,
further, that no such amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver
or consent shall (1) increase the Commitments of any Lender over the amount
thereof then in effect without the consent of such Lender (it being understood
that waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or
Events of Default shall not constitute an increase of the Commitment of any
Lender, and that an increase in the available portion of any Commitment of any
Lender shall not constitute an increase in the Commitment of such Lender), (2)
amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document which affects the rights or obligations of the Swing Line Bank or the
Issuing Banks, as the case may be, without the consent of the Swing Line Bank or
the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, (3) amend, modify or waive any provision
of Article 10 as same applies to the

                                    - 115 -
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent or any other provisions as same relates to the rights or
obligations of the Administrative Agent, without the consent of the
Administrative Agent, (4) amend, modify or waive any provisions relating to the
rights or obligations of the Administrative Agent under the other Loan
Documents, without the consent of the Administrative Agent, (5) alter the
required application of any prepayments or repayments (or commitment reduction),
as between the various Facilities pursuant to Section 2.6(b) (although the
Required Lenders may waive in whole or in part, any such prepayment, repayment
or commitment reduction so long as the application, as amongst the various
Facilities, of any such prepayment, repayment or commitment reduction which is
still required to be made is not altered), without the consent of the Majority
Lenders of each Facility which is being allocated a lesser prepayment, repayment
or commitment reduction, (6) amend the definition of Majority Lenders, without
the consent of the Majority Lenders of each Facility or (7) amend the definition
of Pro Rata Share, without the consent of the Majority Lenders of the Revolving
Facility.

right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law or in equity.

         SECTION 11.4 Costs and Expenses.

         (a) The Borrower agrees to pay on demand (i) all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Agents in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, and of the
Administrative Agent in connection with modification and amendment of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, (A) all reasonable due diligence,
collateral review, syndication (including printing, distribution and bank
meetings), transportation, computer, duplication, appraisal, audit, insurance,
consultant, search, filing and recording fees and expenses, and (B) the
reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Agents with
respect thereto, with respect to advising the Agents as to their rights and
responsibilities, or the perfection, protection or preservation of rights or
interests under the Loan Documents, with respect to negotiations with any Loan
Party or with other creditors of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries
arising out of any Default or any events or circumstances that may give rise to
a Default and with respect to presenting claims in or otherwise participating in
or monitoring any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding involving
creditors' rights generally and any proceeding ancillary thereto) and (ii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Agents and the Lender Parties
in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents, whether in any action,
suit or litigation or any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding
affecting creditors' rights generally or otherwise (including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agents and each
Lender Party with respect thereto).

         (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, each
Lender Party and each of their respective Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified
Party") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
and settlement costs) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any
Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by
reason of, or in connection with the preparation for a defense of, any
investigation, litigation or proceeding arising out of, related to or in
connection with (i) the Transaction, (ii) any acquisition or proposed
acquisition or similar business combination or proposed business combination by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of all or any portion of the shares of
capital stock or substantially all of the property and assets of any other
Person, (iii) the Facilities, the actual or

                                    - 118 -
<PAGE>
proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances or the Letters of Credit by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents, or (iv) the actual or alleged presence of
Hazardous Materials on any property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or any Environmental Action relating in any way to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its directors, officers, employees,
stockholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the Transaction is consummated,
except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in
a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such
Indemnified Party's gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The
Borrower also agrees not to assert any claim against the Administrative Agent,
any Lender Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory
of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising
out of or otherwise relating to the Facilities, the actual or proposed use of
the proceeds of the Advances or the Letters of Credit, the Loan Documents or any
of the Transaction, other than claims for direct, as opposed to consequential,
damages.

         (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar
Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender Party
other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result
of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(i) or 2.10(d) or a
prepayment pursuant to Section 2.6(a) or (b), acceleration of the maturity of
the Notes pursuant to Article 9 or for any other reason, the Borrower shall,
upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Lender Party any amounts required to compensate such Lender Party for any
additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as a result of
such payment, including, without limitation, any loss (including, without
limitation, a return on such liquidation or deployment that would result in such
Lender receiving less than it would have received had such Advances remained
outstanding until the last day of the Interest Period), cost or expense incurred
by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds
required by any Lender Party to fund or maintain such Advance.

         (d) If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs, expenses or
other amounts payable by it under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel and indemnities, such amount may be
paid on behalf of such Loan Party by the Administrative Agent, in its sole
discretion.

         (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any
Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the agreements and
obligations of the Borrower contained in Sections 2.10 and 2.12 and this Section
11.4 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other
amounts payable hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents.


                                    - 119 -
<PAGE>
         (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, unless a Lender gives notice to the Borrower that it is obligated to
pay an amount under Section 2.10, 2.12 or 11.4(c) within 180 days after the date
the Lender Party incurs the respective increased costs, taxes, loss, expense or
liability, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on
capital, then such Lender Party shall only be entitled to be compensated for
such amount by the Borrower or any other Loan Party pursuant to said Section
2.10, 2.12 or 11.4(c) to the extent the costs, taxes, loss, expense or
liability, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on
capital are incurred or suffered on or after the date which occurs 180 days
prior to such Lender giving notice to the Borrower that it is obligated to pay
the respective amounts pursuant to said Section 2.10, 2.12 or 11.4(c). Each
Lender, in determining additional amounts owing under Section 2.10, 2.12 or
11.4(c), will act reasonably and in good faith and to the extent the increased
costs or reductions in amounts receivable or reduction in return on capital
relate to such Lender Party's loans, commitments or letters of credit in general
and not specifically attributable to the Advances or Letters of Credit
hereunder, use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable and which
cover all advances and letters of credit similar to the Advances and Letters of
Credit made, issued or participated in by such Lender Party whether or not the
documentation for such other advances or letters of credit permit such Lender
Party to receive amounts of the type described in such Section 2.10, 2.12 and
11.4(c).

         SECTION 11.5 Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Article 9 to authorize the Administrative
Agent to declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Article
9, each Lender Party and each of its respective Affiliates is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and otherwise apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any
time owing by such Lender Party or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries against any and all of the
Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and
the Note or Notes (if any) held by such Lender Party, irrespective of whether
such Lender Party shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note
or Notes and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender Party
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any
such set-off and application; provided, however, that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights
of each Lender Party and its respective Affiliates under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other
rights of set-off) that such Lender Party and its respective Affiliates may have
at law, in equity or otherwise.

         SECTION 11.6 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when
it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and
when the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender
and each Issuing Bank that each such Initial Lender and each such Issuing Bank
has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender Party and

                                    - 120 -
<PAGE>
their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have
the right to assign any of its rights hereunder or any interest herein without
the prior written consent of the Lender Parties.

         SECTION 11.7      Assignments and Participations.

         (a) Each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances
owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i)
except in the case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such
assignment, was a Lender (or an Affiliate of a Lender) or an assignment of all
of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the
Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such
assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $1,000,000, (ii) no
such assignments shall be permitted without the prior consent of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default or Default then exists,
the Borrower (in either case, which consents shall not be unreasonably
withheld), (iii) no such assignment shall be permitted if, immediately after
giving effect thereto, the Borrower would be required to make payments to or on
behalf of the assignee Lender Party pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or (b) or 2.12
and the assignor Lender Party was not, at the time of such assignment, entitled
to receive any payment pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or (b) or 2.12, and (iv) the
parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and
Acceptance, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (other than with respect to an
assignment to one or more of a Lender's Affiliates, in which event such fee
shall be $1,500, and other than with respect to an assignment by or to Bank of
America, in which event such fee shall not apply).

         (b) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and
after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender or Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, hereunder and (y) the Lender or Issuing Bank assignor thereunder
shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by
it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning
Lender's or Issuing Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender or Issuing Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

         (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender Party assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and
agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender Party makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility

                                    - 121 -
<PAGE>
with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the
perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to
be created under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or
thereto; (ii) such assigning Lender Party makes no representation or warranty
and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the
Borrower or any other Loan Party or the performance or observance by any Loan
Party of any of its obligations under any Loan Document or any other instrument
or document furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has
received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial
statements referred to in Section 4.6 and such other documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to
enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning
Lender Party or any other Lender Party and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such
assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints
and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms
hereof and thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender or Issuing Bank, as the
case may be.

         (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to
in Section 11.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lender Parties and the Commitment under each Facility of, and principal
amount of the Advances owing under each Facility to, each Lender Party from time
to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as a Lender Party hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any
Lender Party at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice. No assignment shall be effective unless and until the Assignment and
Acceptance has been accepted by the Administrative Agent and registered in the
Register. This Section 11.7(d) shall be construed so that the Notes are at all
times maintained in "registered form" for purposes of Internal Revenue Code
Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) and any related regulations promulgated
thereunder (or any successor provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or such
regulations).

         (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender Party and an assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject
to such assignment and

                                    - 122 -
<PAGE>
the appropriate processing and reconciliation fee, the Administrative Agent
shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in
substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and
(iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. In the case of any assignment
by a Lender, within ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of such notice and
the return of the old Notes (or a customary indemnity with respect to any lost
Notes), the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or Notes a new Note to
the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed
by it under a Facility pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the
assigning Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder under such Facility, a new
Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment
retained by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered
Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and
Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit B, C or D
hereto, as the case may be .

         (f) Each Issuing Bank may assign to an Eligible Assignee all of its
rights and obligations under the undrawn portion of its Letter of Credit
Commitment at any time; provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall
be to an Eligible Assignee and (ii) the parties to each such assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (other than with respect to an
assignment by or to Bank of America).

         (g) Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or more Persons
(other than any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and
the Note or Notes, if any, held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender
Party's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its
Commitments) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender Party shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
other Lender Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
Party in connection with such Lender Party's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any
right to approve any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by
any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver,
modification or consent would reduce the rate of interest or extend the final
scheduled maturity of any Advance or Note, or the date for payment of any fees
or other interest on any Advance, or waive or excuse any such payment or any
part thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any Advance, or reduce the
principal amount thereof, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or release all or substantially all of the Collateral (except as
expressly provided in the Collateral Documents) under all of the Collateral
Documents. If a

                                    - 123 -
<PAGE>
Lender Party that is not a United States Person with the meaning of Internal
Revenue Code Section 7701 sells a participating interest pursuant to this
Section 11.7(g) (or otherwise ceases to own a beneficial interest in all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement for purposes of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(c)(6)) such Lender Party shall provide the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent with revised forms required by Section
2.12(c) reflecting the portion of the rights and obligations under this
Agreement which have been sold on an Internal Revenue Service form W-8IMY
(including the required attachments thereto) and that portion of the rights and
obligations retained on an Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as
appropriate.

         (h) Any Lender Party may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
11.7, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender
Party by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided, however, that, prior to any
such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
received by it from such Lender Party in accordance with the terms set forth in
Section 11.10.

         (i) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender Party may at any time create a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System without notice to, or the consent of, the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent and any Lender which is a fund may pledge all or any
portion of Advances owing to it or the Note or Notes held by it to its trustee
in support of its obligations to its trustee. No such pledge, assignment or
creation of security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its
obligations under this Agreement.

         SECTION 11.8 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
telecopier shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
of this Agreement.

         SECTION 11.9 No Liability of the Issuing Banks. The Borrower assumes
all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any
Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. No Issuing
Bank nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable or
responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any
acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b)
the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement
thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by any Issuing Bank
against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter
of

                                    - 124 -
<PAGE>
Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate
reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in
making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the
Borrower shall have a claim against any Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank
shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not
consequential, damages suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves were
caused by (i) such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence or (ii)
such Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of
Credit after the presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly
complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Issuing Bank may accept documents
that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary.

         SECTION 11.10 Confidentiality. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any
Lender Party shall disclose any Confidential Information to any Person without
the consent of the Borrower, other than (a) to the Administrative Agent's or
such Lender Party's Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents,
auditors and advisors and to actual or prospective Eligible Assignees and
participants, and then only on a confidential basis and subject to such Person's
agreement to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, (b)
as required by any law, rule or regulation or judicial process, (c) as required
by any state, federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating banks or
banking and (d) in any court action between any Loan Party and the
Administrative Agent or any Lender Party arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         SECTION 11.11 Further Assurances. (a) At any time and from time to
time, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Loan Party shall
execute, deliver and acknowledge or cause to be executed, delivered or
acknowledged, such further documents and instruments and do such further acts as
the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order to fully affect the
purposes of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any other agreements,
instruments and documents delivered pursuant hereto or in connection with the
Facilities.

                  (b) Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or
mutilation of any Note or Collateral Document which is not of public record and,
in the case of any such mutilation, upon the surrender and cancellation of such
Note or Collateral Document, the Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a
replacement Note or Collateral Document in the same principal amount thereof (in
the case of any Note) and otherwise of like tenor.

         SECTION 11.12     JURISDICTION, ETC.

         (a) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY
NEW YORK STATE COURT OR FEDERAL COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SITTING IN
NEW YORK CITY, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION OR

OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.

         (b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO, ANY OBJECTION THAT
IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
