Commitments to Make Loans</a>.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Syndicated Loans</u>.
Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth
herein, to make Syndicated Loans to the Borrowers from time to time before the
Termination Date; provided that, immediately after each such Syndicated Loan is
made:</p>

<h4>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Syndicated Loans
by such Lender shall not exceed the amount of its Commitment, and</h4>

<h4>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
Syndicated Loans, Swing Loans, and Letter of Credit Obligations shall not
exceed the aggregate amount of all Commitments, and</h4>

<h4>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Working Capital Obligations shall not exceed the lesser of
(A) the aggregate amount of all Commitments and (B) the Borrowing Base; </h4>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Each Syndicated Borrowing under this Section 2.01(a) shall
be in an aggregate principal amount of (X) as to Base Rate Loans, $1,000,000 or
any larger integral multiple of $500,000, and (Y) as to Euro-Dollar Loans,
$5,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of $1,000,000 (except that in either
case any such Syndicated Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount of the Unused
Commitments) and shall be made by the several Lenders ratably in proportion to
their respective Commitments.  Within
the foregoing limits, the Borrowers may borrow under this Section, repay or, to
the extent permitted by Section 2.09 and Section 2.11, prepay Syndicated Loans
and reborrow under this Section 2.01(a) at any time before the Termination
Date.</p>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Swing Loans</u>.  In
addition to the foregoing, Wachovia shall from time to time, upon the request
of the Borrowers, if the applicable conditions precedent in Article 3 have been
satisfied, make Swing Loans to the Borrowers in an aggregate principal amount
at any time outstanding not exceeding $15,000,000; provided that, immediately
after such Swing Loan is made, the conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and
(iii)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;2.01(a)&nbsp;shall have been satisfied.  Each Swing Loan Borrowing under this
Section&nbsp;2.01(b)&nbsp;shall be in an aggregate principal amount of
$1,000,000 or any larger multiple of $500,000.
Within the foregoing limits, the Borrowers may borrow under this Section&nbsp;2.01(b),
prepay and reborrow under this Section&nbsp;2.01(b)&nbsp;at any time before the
Termination Date.  Swing Loans shall not
be considered a utilization of the Commitment of Wachovia or any other Lender hereunder.  All Swing Loans shall be made as Base Rate
Loans.  At any time, upon the request of
Wachovia, each Lender (other than Wachovia, which shall retain its ratable
share thereof) shall, on the third Domestic Business Day after such request is
made, purchase a participating interest in Swing Loans in an amount equal to
its ratable share (based upon its respective Commitment)&nbsp;of such Swing
Loans.  On such third Domestic Business
Day, each Lender will immediately transfer to Wachovia, in immediately
available funds, the amount of its participation.  Whenever, at any time after Wachovia has received from any such
Lender its participating interest in a Swing Loan, the Administrative Agent
receives any payment on account thereof, the Administrative Agent will
distribute to such Lender its participating interest in such amount
(appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the
period of time during which such Lender's participating interest was
outstanding and funded); provided, however, that in the event that such payment
received by the Administrative Agent is required to be returned, such Lender
will return to the Administrative Agent any portion thereof previously
distributed by the Administrative Agent to it.
Each Lender's obligation to purchase such participating interests shall
be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including, without limitation:
(i)&nbsp;any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Lender or any other Person may have against Wachovia requesting such
purchase or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii)&nbsp;the
occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the
termination of the Commitments; (iii)&nbsp;any adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise)&nbsp;of either of the Borrowers, the Parent, or any
other Person; (iv)&nbsp;any breach of this Agreement by the Parent or either of
the Borrowers or any other Lender; or (v)&nbsp;any other circumstance,
happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.&nbsp;

Method of Borrowing Loans</a>..</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrowers shall give the Administrative Agent notice (a
"Notice of Borrowing"), which shall be substantially in the form of <u>Exhibit
E-1</u>, prior to (i) 2:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia, time) on the same Domestic
Business Day of each Swing Loan Borrowing, (ii) 12:00 Noon (Atlanta, Georgia,
time) on the same Domestic Business Day of each Syndicated Loan which is a Base
Rate Borrowing, and (iii) 12:00 Noon (Atlanta, Georgia, time) at least 3
Euro-Dollar Business Days before each Syndicated Loan which is a Euro-Dollar
Borrowing, specifying:</p>

<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Domestic Business
Day in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the
case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing,</p>

<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the aggregate amount of such Borrowing,</p>

<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be Base
Rate Loans, Euro-Dollar Loans, or Swing Loans, and</p>

<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, the duration of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition
of Interest Period.</p>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing for a Syndicated
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the
contents thereof and of such Lender's ratable share of such Syndicated
Borrowing, and such Notice of Borrowing, once received by the Administrative
Agent, shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrowers.&nbsp;
<p>

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not later than 2:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia, time) on the date
of each Syndicated Borrowing, each Lender shall (except as provided in
paragraph (d) of this Section) make available its ratable share of such
Syndicated Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately available in
Atlanta, Georgia, to the Administrative Agent at its address determined
pursuant to Section 10.01.  Unless the
Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in
Article 3 has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the funds
so received from the Lenders available to the Borrowers at the Administrative
Agent's aforesaid address.  Unless the
Administrative Agent receives notice from a Lender, at the Administrative
Agent's address referred to in or specified pursuant to Section 10.01, no later
than 4:00 P.M. (local time at such address) on the Domestic Business Day before
the date of a Syndicated Borrowing stating that such Lender will not make a
Syndicated Loan in connection with such Syndicated Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that such Lender will make a
Syndicated Loan in connection with such Syndicated Borrowing and, in reliance
on such assumption, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated
to) make available such Lender's ratable share of such Syndicated Borrowing to
the Borrowers for the account of such Lender.
If the Administrative Agent makes such Lender's ratable share available
to the Borrowers and such Lender does not in fact make its ratable share of
such Syndicated Borrowing available on such date, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to recover such Lender's ratable share from either (but not
both) (i) such Lender, together with interest thereon for each day during the
period from the date of such Syndicated Borrowing until such sum shall be paid
in full at a rate per annum equal to the overnight Federal funds to cover such
amount for each such day during such period, or (ii) the Borrowers (and for
such purpose shall be entitled, after notice to the Borrowers, to charge such
amount to any account of the Borrowers maintained with the Administrative
Agent), together with interest thereon for each day during the period from the
date of such Syndicated Borrowing until such sum shall be paid in full at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate or Adjusted London Interbank Offered
Rate, whichever is in effect for such Loan, plus the Applicable Margin; <u>provided</u>
that (x) any such payment by the Borrowers of such Lender's ratable share and
interest thereon shall be without prejudice to any rights that the Borrowers
may have against such Lender and (y) until such Lender has paid its ratable
share of such Syndicated Borrowing, together with interest pursuant to the
foregoing, it will have no interest in or rights with respect to such
Syndicated Borrowing for any purpose hereunder.  If the Administrative Agent does not exercise its option to
advance funds for the account of such Lender, it shall forthwith notify the
Borrowers of such decision.  Unless the
Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in
Section 3 has not been satisfied, Wachovia will make available to the Borrowers
at Wachovia's Lending Office the amount of any such Borrowing which is a Swing
Loan Borrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; If any Lender makes a new Syndicated Loan hereunder on a day
on which any Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Syndicated
Loan from such Lender, such Lender shall apply the proceeds of its new
Syndicated Loan to make such repayment as a Refunding Loan and only an amount
equal to the difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed and the
amount of such Refunding Loan shall be made available by such Lender to the
Administrative Agent as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section, or remitted
by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.13, as
the case may be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Lenders shall not be obligated to make any Euro-Dollar Loans if
there shall have occurred a Default or an Event of Default, which Default or
Event of Default shall not have been cured or waived, and all Refunding Loans
shall be made as Base Rate Loans (but shall bear interest at the Default Rate,
if applicable).  Nothing in the
preceding sentence shall obligate, or be deemed to obligate, any of the Lenders
to make any Loans at all during the existence of an Event of Default, other
than Refunding Loans in the event that the Obligations have not been
accelerated pursuant to Section 7.01.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that a Notice of Borrowing fails to specify
whether the Syndicated Loans comprising such Syndicated Borrowing are to be
Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, such Syndicated Loans shall be made as
Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrowers are
otherwise entitled under this Agreement to repay any Syndicated Loans maturing
at the end of an Interest Period applicable thereto with the proceeds of a new
Borrowing, and the Borrowers fail to repay such Syndicated Loans using its own
moneys and fails to give a Notice of Borrowing in connection with such new
Syndicated Borrowing, a new Syndicated Borrowing shall be deemed to be made on
the date such Syndicated Loans mature in an amount equal to the principal
amount of the Syndicated Loans so maturing, and the Syndicated Loans comprising
such new Syndicated Borrowing shall be Base Rate Loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
there shall not be more than 12 Euro-Dollar Borrowings outstanding at any given
time.&nbsp;</p>

the Consolidated Subsidiaries as measured by the Leverage Ratio for the
immediately preceding Fiscal Quarter of the Parent.  Except as set forth in the last sentence hereof, any such

for herein shall be effective 45 days after the end of each of the Parent's
first three Fiscal Quarters of each Fiscal Year and 90 days after the end of

Date"); <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that any reduction in the Applicable
Margin shall not apply to any Euro-Dollar Loans outstanding on a Performance
Pricing Determination Date that have an Interest Period commencing before such
Performance Pricing Determination Date.

Borrowers setting forth the Leverage Ratio are not received by Administrative
Agent by the date required pursuant to Section 6.01(a) and (b) of this
Agreement (and without limiting the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders

a failure to timely deliver such financial statements or Compliance Certificate
is waived in writing by the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders.  </p>

principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until it
becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day plus the

shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per
annum equal to the Default Rate.

principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the applicable
Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period.  Such interest shall be payable for each
Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer
than 3 months, at intervals of 3 months after the first day therof.  Any overdue principal of and, to the extent

Period, which rates appear on Telerate Page 3750 effective as of 11:00 A.M.,

liabilities" (or in respect of any other category of liabilities which includes
deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is
determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
General Provisions as to Payments</b></a>.&nbsp;
<p>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrowers shall make each payment of principal of, and
interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, without any setoff, counterclaim
or any deduction whatsoever, not later than 11:00 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia, time)
on the date when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available in
Atlanta, Georgia, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in
Section 10.01.  The Administrative Agent
will promptly distribute to Wachovia each such payment received on account of
Swing Loans and to each Lender its ratable share of each such payment received by
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base
Rate Loans or of fees hereunder shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic
Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Domestic Business Day.
Whenever any payment of principal of or interest on, the Euro-Dollar
Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date
for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar
Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar
month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding
Euro-Dollar Business Day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All payments of principal, interest and fees and all other
amounts to be made by the Borrowers with respect to the Obligations or
otherwise (including, without limitation, with respect to the Letter of Credit
Obligations) pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid without deduction for,
and free from, any tax, imposts, levies, duties, deductions, or withholdings of
any nature now or at anytime hereafter imposed by any governmental authority or
by any taxing authority thereof or therein excluding in the case of each
Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender is
organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender,
taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction of such Lender's applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, imposts, levies, duties,
deductions or withholdings of any nature being "Taxes").  In the event that the Borrowers are required
by applicable law to make any such withholding or deduction of Taxes with
respect to any of the Obligations, the Borrowers shall pay such deduction or
withholding to the applicable taxing authority, shall promptly furnish to any
Lender in respect of which such deduction or withholding is made all receipts and
other documents evidencing such payment and shall pay to such Lender additional
amounts as may be necessary in order that the amount received by such Lender
after the required withholding or other payment shall equal the amount such
Lender would have received had no such withholding or other payment been
made.  If no withholding or deduction of
Taxes are payable in respect to any Obligations, the Borrowers shall furnish
any Lender, at such Lender's request, a certificate from each applicable taxing
authority or an opinion of counsel acceptable to such Lender, in either case
stating that such payments are exempt from or not subject to withholding or
deduction of Taxes.  If the Borrowers
fail to provide such original or certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
of Taxes or certificate(s) or opinion of counsel of exemption, the Borrowers
hereby agree to compensate such Lender for, and indemnify them with respect to,
the tax consequences of the Borrowers' failure to provide evidence of tax
payments or tax exemption.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Each Lender which is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any state thereof or
the District of Columbia (each a "Non&#8209;U.S. Lender") agrees to furnish to
the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on the date of this Agreement, if a
signatory hereto, or within 10 Domestic Business Days after it becomes a Lender
hereunder, two (2) copies of either (a) U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224
or U. S. Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 for the year 2000, or (b)
thereafter, U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN, or (c) any successor forms thereto (wherein such Non&#8209;U.S.
Lender claims entitlement to complete exemption from or a reduced rate of U.S.
federal withholding tax on interest paid by the Borrowers hereunder) and to
provide to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent a new Form 4224 or Form
1001, or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN, or any successor forms thereto if any previously delivered
form is found to be incomplete or incorrect in any material respect or upon the
obsolescence of any previously delivered form; <u>provided</u> that if any
Lender complies with the requirements of this paragraph on the Closing Date or
at such time as such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, but is unable at
any time thereafter, for any reason, to establish such exemption, or to file
such forms, the Borrowers shall nonetheless remain obligated under the terms of
the immediately preceding paragraph with respect to such Lender.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Borrowers
are  required to pay any Lender amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.13, the Borrowers may give notice to such Lender
(with copies to the Administrative Agent) that they wish to seek one or more
assignees (which may be one or more of the other Lenders) to assume the
Commitment of such Lender and to purchase such Lender's outstanding Loans and
Notes for an amount equal to the sum of the outstanding unpaid principal of and
accrued interest on such Loans and Notes, plus all other fees and amounts due
to such Lender hereunder, in each case, to the date such Loans, Notes and
interest are purchased.  Upon such sale
or prepayment, each such Lender shall have no further commitment or other
obligation to the Borrowers hereunder or under any Note. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the event any Lender receives a refund of any Taxes
paid by the Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.13(c), it will pay to the
Borrowers the amount of such refund promptly upon receipt thereof; provided
that if at any time thereafter it is required to return such refund, the
Borrowers shall promptly repay to it the amount of such refund. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers and
the Lenders contained in this Section 2.13(c) shall be applicable with respect
to any Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and any calculations required
by such provisions (i) shall be made based upon the circumstances of such
Participant, Assignee or other Transferee and (ii) constitute a continuing
agreement and shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment
in full or cancellation of the Notes.</p>

(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; All monies to be applied to the Obligations, whether such
monies represent voluntary payments by the Borrowers, Net Cash Proceeds, or are
received from any disposition of Collateral (subject to any apportioning of the
proceeds from such disposition to the Noteholders in accordance with the
Collateral Documents), shall be allocated among the Administrative Agent and
such of the Lenders as are entitled thereto (and, with respect to monies
allocated to the Lenders in accordance with their ratable share of the
Commitments unless otherwise provided herein) in the following order (in each
case, until all Obligations within each category itemized in this paragraph (d)
below are fully paid): (i) first, to the Administrative Agent for the payment
of all of the Administrative Agent's fees and expenses accrued but not paid;
(ii) second, to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and
Wachovia in payment of the accrued interest due and payable on the Loans; (iii)
third, to Wachovia toward payment of outstanding principal of the Swing Loans;
(iv) fourth, to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders toward
payment of outstanding principal of all other Base Rate Loans; (v) fifth, to
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders toward payment of
outstanding principal of the Euro-Dollar Loans; (vi) sixth, to the payment of
any fees payable with respect to any outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations
then due and owing; (vii) seventh, as cash collateral for any outstanding
Letter of Credit Obligations equal to 110% of the undrawn amount thereof;
(viii) eighth, to payment of the Reimbursement Obligations; (ix) ninth, to the
Lenders in payment of accrued interest then due and payable in respect of any
Obligations other than the Loans then outstanding; (x) tenth, to the Lenders
toward payment of any expenses that have not been reimbursed to the Lenders by
the Parent or the Borrowers (or the other Lenders, as applicable) in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, together with any interest accrued thereon; (xi)
eleventh, to the Administrative Agent to pay any amounts owed under
indemnification obligations that have not been paid to Agent by the Lenders or
the Parent or the Borrowers, together with interest accrued thereon; (xii)
twelfth, to the Lenders for any amounts owed under indemnification obligations
that they have paid to the Administrative Agent and for any expenses that they
have reimbursed to the Administrative Agent; (xiii) thirteenth, to any other
Obligations then due and payable; and (xiv) fourteenth, to the Borrowers or

Requests for Issuance of Letters of Credit</a>.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Request for Issuance</u>.
At least two Domestic Business Days before the effective date for any
Letter of Credit, the relevant Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent a
written notice containing the original signature of an authorized officer or
employee of such Borrower substantially in the form of <u>Exhibit P-1</u>.  Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the original face amount of the Letter of Credit requested, the
effective date (which day shall be a Domestic Business Day) of issuance of such
requested Letter of Credit, the date on which such requested Letter of Credit
is to expire, the amount of then outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations, the
purpose for which such Letter of Credit is to be issued, whether such Letter of
Credit may be drawn in single or partial draws and the person for whose benefit
the requested Letter of Credit is to be issued, and, in the case of a Letter of
Credit denominated in a foreign currency, such foreign currency, subject
however, to the acceptance of such foreign currency by the Foreign LC
Issuer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Issuance; Notice of Issuance</u>.  If the original face amount of the requested Letter of Credit is
less than or equal to the Unused Commitment at such time and the applicable
conditions set forth in this Agreement are satisfied, the Issuer shall issue
the requested Letter of Credit.  The
Issuer shall give each Lender written or telex notice in substantially the form
of <u>Exhibit P-2</u> (each, a "Letter of Credit Notice"), or telephonic notice
confirmed promptly thereafter in writing, of the issuance of a Letter of Credit
and shall deliver to each Lender in connection with such notice a copy of the
Letter of Credit issued by the Issuer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>No Extension or Amendment</u>.  No Issuer shall extend or amend any Letter of Credit if the

Letter of Credit Reimbursement Obligations; Duties of
the Issuer.</a>

&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Reimbursement</u>.
Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in any Letter of Credit
Application Agreement:</p>

<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the relevant Borrower shall reimburse relevant Issuer for
drawings under a Letter of Credit issued by it no later than the earlier of (A)
the time specified in such Letter of Credit Application Agreement, or (B) 1
Domestic Business Day after the payment by the Issuer; </p>

<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
any Reimbursement Obligation with respect to any Letter of
Credit shall bear interest from the date of the relevant drawing under the
pertinent Letter of Credit until the date of payment in full thereof at a rate
per annum equal to (A) prior to the date that is 3 Domestic Business Days after
the date of the related payment by the Issuer, the Base Rate and (B)
thereafter, the Default Rate; and</p>

<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in order to implement the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a
draw under any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuer is reimbursed in accordance
with subsection (i) above, the Borrowers irrevocably authorize the
Administrative Agent to treat such nonpayment as a Notice of Borrowing in the
amount of such Reimbursement Obligation and to make Syndicated Loans to the
Borrowers in such amount (which amount shall be the Dollar Equivalent amount
with respect to a Letter of Credit denominated in a foreign currency)
regardless of whether the conditions precedent to the making of Loans hereunder
have been met.  Each Borrower further
authorizes the Administrative Agent to credit the proceeds of such Loan so as
to immediately eliminate the liability of the Borrowers for Reimbursement
Obligations under such Letter of Credit.</p>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Duties of the Administrative Agent</u>.  Any action taken or omitted to be taken by
the relevant Issuer in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or
omitted in the absence of willful misconduct or gross negligence, shall not put
such Issuer under any resulting liability to any Lender, or assuming that such
Issuer has complied with the procedures specified in Section 2.18 and such
Lender has not given a notice contemplated by Section 2.20(a) that continues in
full force and effect, relieve any Lender of its obligations hereunder to such
Issuer.  In determining whether to pay
under any Letter of Credit, the Issuer shall have no obligation relative to the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders other than to confirm that any documents
required to have been delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to comply on
their face, with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.&nbsp;

Letter of Credit Participations</a>.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Purchase of Participations</u>.  Immediately upon issuance by any Issuer of any Letter of Credit
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.18, each Lender shall
be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from
such Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and
participation, to the extent of such Lender's ratable share of the aggregate
Commitments, in each Letter of Credit (or guaranty pertaining thereto)
outstanding on the date of this Agreement and issued under the terms of this
Agreement hereafter; <u>provided</u>, that a Letter of Credit shall not be
entitled to the benefits of this Section 2.20 if the Administrative Agent and
the relevant Issuer shall have received written notice from any Lender on or
before the Domestic Business Day immediately prior to the date of the relevant
Issuer's issuance of such Letter of Credit that one or more of the conditions
contained in Section 2.17 or Article 4 is not then satisfied, and, in the event
the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuer receives such a notice and
determines that one or more such conditions contained in Section 2.17 or
Article 4 is not then satisfied, it shall have no further obligation to issue
any Letter of Credit until such notice is withdrawn by that Lender or until the
Required Lenders have effectively waived such condition in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.  The parties
to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that all collateral security held by an
Issuer or any other issuer of a Letter of Credit securing any of the Letter of
Credit Obligations shall constitute collateral security for the ratable benefit
of the Lenders as risk participants and the Secured Parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Sharing of Letter of Credit Payments</u>.  In the event that any Issuer makes any
payment under any Letter of Credit for which the Borrower shall not have repaid
such amount to the Issuer pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.21 or which cannot be paid
by a Loan pursuant to Section 2.19(a)(iii), the Issuer shall notify the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender of such failure, and each Lender shall promptly and unconditionally pay
to the relevant Issuer such Lender's ratable share of the Dollar Equivalent
amount of such payment and in same day funds.
If the Administrative Agent so notifies such Lender prior to 10:00 A.M.
(Atlanta, Georgia, time)&nbsp;on any Domestic Business Day, such Lender shall
make available to the relevant Issuer its ratable share of the amount of such
payment on such Domestic Business Day in same day funds.  If and to the extent such Lender shall not
have so made its ratable share of the amount of such payment available to the
relevant Issuer, such Lender agrees to pay to such Issuer forthwith on demand
such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
payment was first due until the date such amount is paid to the Issuer at the
Base Rate for the first 3 days and thereafter at the Default Rate.  The failure of any Lender to make available
to the Issuer its Commitment Share of any such payment shall neither relieve
nor increase the obligation of any other Lender hereunder to make available to
the relevant Issuer its ratable share of any payment on the date such payment
is to be made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Sharing of Reimbursement Obligation Payments</u>. Whenever
an Issuer receives a payment on account of a Reimbursement Obligation,
including any interest thereon, as to which the Issuer has received any
payments from the Lenders pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.20, it shall promptly
pay to each Lender which has funded its participating interest therein, in
Dollars, an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Share thereof.  Each such payment shall be made by the
Issuer on the Domestic Business Day on which the funds are paid to such Person,
if received prior to noon, 12:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia, time), on such
Domestic Business Day, and otherwise on the next succeeding Domestic Business
Day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Documentation</u>.
Upon the request of any Lender, the Issuers shall furnish to such Lender
copies of any Letter of Credit, Letter of Credit Application Agreement and
other documentation relating to Letters of Credit issued pursuant to this
Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Obligations Irrevocable</u>.  The obligations of the Lenders to make payments to the Issuers
with respect to a Letter of Credit shall be irrevocable, not subject to any
qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with, but
not subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all
circumstances (assuming that an Issuer has issued such Letter of Credit in
accordance with  Section 2.17 and such
Lender has not given a notice contemplated by Section 2.20(a) that continues in

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any time the Administrative Agent may, and, upon the
written request of any Lender after receipt of any Letter of Credit Notice the
Administrative Agent will, calculate the Dollar Equivalent of each Letter of
Credit denominated in a foreign currency, and in the event that, as a result of
such calculation, the Dollar Equivalent of all Letters of Credit denominated in
a foreign currency outstanding exceeds $5,000,000, then, upon request by the

in a foreign currency with respect to any Letter of Credit denominated in a
foreign currency as required by this Agreement or any Letter of Credit
Application Agreement, the Foreign LC Issuer may, through the Administrative
Agent, require such payment to be made in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent
amount of such payment.  In any case in
which the Borrowers shall make such payment in Dollars, the Borrowers agree to
hold the Foreign LC Issuer and each Lender harmless from any loss incurred by
the Foreign LC Issuer and such Lender arising from any change in the value of

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court or
enforcing any such judgment it is necessary to convert any amount due in any
foreign currency into any other currency, the rate of exchange used shall be
the Administrative Agent's spot rate of exchange for the purchase of the
foreign currency with such other currency at the close of business on the
Euro-Dollar Business Day preceding the date on which judgment is given or any
order for payment is made. The obligation of the Borrowers in respect of any
amount due from them hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment or order for
a liquidated sum or sums in respect of amounts due hereunder or under any
judgment or order in any other currency or otherwise be discharged only to the
extent that on the Euro-Dollar Business Day following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment in a currency other than the relevant
foreign currency the Administrative Agent is able (in accordance with normal
lending procedures) to purchase the relevant foreign currency with such other
currency.  If the amount of the relevant
foreign currency that the Administrative Agent is able to purchase with such
other currency is less than the amount due in the relevant foreign currency,
notwithstanding any judgment or order, the Borrowers shall indemnify the
Foreign LC Issuer and each Lender for the shortfall.&nbsp;</p>

a separate collateral agent or co-collateral agent which is not so prohibited
from taking any of such actions or exercising any of such powers, rights or
remedies.  If the Collateral Agent shall
appoint an additional Person as a separate collateral agent or co-collateral
agent as provided above, each and every remedy, power, right, claim, demand or

every remedy, power, right, claim, demand or cause of action intended by this

collateral agent or co-collateral agent shall run to and be enforceable by any
of them.  Should any instrument from the
Lenders be required by the separate collateral agent or co-collateral agent so
appointed by the Collateral Agent in order more fully and certainly to vest in
and confirm to him or it such rights, powers, duties and obligations, any and
all of such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and
delivered by the Lenders whether or not a Default or Event of Default then
exists.  In case any separate collateral
agent or co-collateral agent, or a successor to either, shall die, become
incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the estates, properties, rights,
power, duties and obligations of such separate collateral agent or
co-collateral agent, so far as permitted by applicable law, shall vest in and

amounts owed under Section&nbsp;9.03 (other than due to any change in the
Eurodollar Reserve Percentage), or gives notice under Section&nbsp;9.02 that it
can no longer participate in Euro-Dollar Loans, then in each case the Borrowers
shall have the right, if no Default or Event of Default exists, and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;10.08(c), to designate an
assignee (a "Replacement Lender")&nbsp;to purchase the Notice Lender's share of
outstanding Base Rate Loans, Euro-Dollar Loans and all other obligations
hereunder and to assume the Notice Lender's obligations to the Borrowers under
this Agreement; <u>provided</u>, <u>that</u>, any Replacement Lender must be
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders
(and, in any event, may not be an Affiliate of the Parent or any
Subsidiary).  Subject to the foregoing,
the Notice Lender agrees to assign without recourse to the Replacement Lender
its share of outstanding Base Rate Loans and Euro-Dollar Loans and its
Commitment, and to delegate to the Replacement Lender its obligations to the
Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and its future
obligations to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.  Upon such sale and
delegation by the Notice Lender and the purchase and assumption by the
Replacement Lender, and compliance with the provisions of
Section&nbsp;10.08(c), the Notice Lender shall cease to be a "Lender" hereunder
and shall thereafter have no rights to any of the Collateral or the proceeds
thereof, and the Replacement Lender shall become a "Lender" under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall have the same rights under the
Loan Documents with respect to the Collateral as the Notice Lender had prior to
such assignment and assumption; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that any
Notice Lender shall continue to be entitled to the indemnification provisions
contained elsewhere herein.</p>

<p>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Parent and each of the Borrowers hereby grants to the
Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and to Wachovia as
to the Swing Loans, and the Issuers as to the Letter of Credit Obligations, a
lien for all Obligations owing to them from the Borrowers upon all deposits or
deposit accounts, of any kind, or any interest in any deposits or deposit
accounts thereof, now or hereafter pledged, mortgaged, transferred or assigned
to the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, Wachovia, or any such Lender
or Issuer or otherwise in the possession or control of the Collateral Agent,
the Administrative Agent, Wachovia, or any such Lender or Issuer for any
purpose for the account or benefit of the Parent or the Borrowers and including
any balance of any deposit account or of any credit of the Parent or the
Borrowers with the Administrative Agent, Wachovia, or any such Lender or
Issuer, whether now existing or hereafter established, hereby authorizing the
Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, Wachovia, and each Lender or Issuer
at any time or times with or without prior notice, so long as an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to exercise its right of offset,
security interest, and Lien on such balances and accounts, or any part thereof,
and to pay such balances and the proceeds and funds within such accounts to the
Collateral Agent for distribution among the Noteholders and Lenders in
accordance with the terms of the Security Agreement, as if such balances and
property in such accounts were "Proceeds" thereunder, whether or not the
Collateral or other collateral, if any, or the responsibility of other Persons
primarily, secondarily or otherwise liable may be deemed adequate.  The Collateral Agent hereby designates the
Administrative Agent, each Lender, Wachovia, and each Issuer a sub-collateral
agent for purposes of exercising the rights granted to each of them in this
Section 10.05.  For the purposes of this
paragraph, all remittances and property shall be deemed to be in the possession
of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, Wachovia, or any such Lender
or Issuer as soon as the same may be put in transit to it by mail or carrier or
by other bailee.  Each of the Lenders,
the Administrative Agent, the Parent, and the Borrowers agrees that this
Section 10.05 shall constitute a security agreement with respect to such
balances and the accounts in which they are deposited and that, to the extent
such deposit accounts are maintained at the Lenders, the Lenders shall have
control over such deposit accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Wachovia, each Lender, and each Issuer agree that if any of
them shall receive payment, either from the Collateral Agent (through the
Administrative Agent) pursuant to the application of proceeds under a
Collateral Document or otherwise, of a proportion of the aggregate amount of
the principal and interest owing with respect to the Loans held by it, or the
Letter of Credit Obligations, which is greater than the proportion received by
any other Lender in respect of the aggregate amount of all principal and
interest owing with respect to the Loans held by such other Lender, or an
Issuer with respect to the Letter of Credit Obligations, the Lender or Issuer
receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
participations in the Loans held by the other Lenders owing to such other
Lenders and the Letter of Credit Obligations, and such other adjustments shall
be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest
with respect to the Loans held by the Lenders owing to such other Lenders and
the Letter of Credit Obligations shall be shared by the Lenders and the Issuer
ratably in accordance to the ratio their individual Commitment bears to the
aggregate of all Commitments; provided that, if all or any portion of such
payment received by the purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender, such purchase from each other Lender or Issuer shall be
rescinded and such other Lender or Issuer shall repay to the purchasing Lender
or Issuer the purchase price of such participation to the extent of such
recovery together with an amount equal to such other Lender's or Issuer's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other
Lender's or Issuer's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered
from the purchasing Lender or Issuer) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender or Issuer in respect of the total amount so
recovered.  Each of the Borrowers
agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law,
that any holder of a participation in a Loan, or risk participant with respect
to the Letter of Credit Obligations, whether or not acquired pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of setoff or counterclaim and other
rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a
participation were a direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such
participation.&nbsp;</p>

waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall
be delivered by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent (for distribution to
each Lender) forthwith following the date on which the same shall have been
executed and delivered by the requisite percentage of Lenders.  The Borrowers will not, directly or
indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of
supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, to any Lender (in its
capacity as such) as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into
by such Lender of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, on the same terms,

<p>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns; provided that the Borrowers may not assign or otherwise transfer any
of its rights under this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more Persons,
provided that any such Person is a commercial bank or other financial
institution, or a Related Fund or an Affiliate thereof (each a "Participant")
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such
Lender, any Commitment hereunder or any other interest of such Lender
hereunder; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that if a Lender is selling a
participation in only a portion of its Commitment or any other interest of such
Lender hereunder, the participation being sold (determined as of the effective
date of the sale of the participation) shall be in an amount not less than
$5,000,000.  In the event of any such
sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall
remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain
the holder of any such Note for all purposes under this Agreement, and the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement.  In no event shall
a Lender that sells a participation be obligated to the Participant to take or
refrain from taking any action hereunder except that such Lender may agree that
it will not (except as provided below), without the consent of the Participant,
agree to (i) the change of any date fixed for the payment of principal of or
interest on the related loan or loans, (ii) the change of the amount of any
principal, interest or fees due on any date fixed for the payment thereof with
respect to the related loan or loans, (iii) the change of the principal of the
related loan or loans, (iv) any change in the rate at which either interest is
payable thereon or (if the Participant is entitled to any part thereof) fee is
payable hereunder from the rate at which the Participant is entitled to receive
interest or fee (as the case may be) in respect of such participation, (v) the
release or substitution of all or any substantial part of the Collateral (if
any) held as security for the Loans, or (vi) the release of any Guarantee given
to support payment of the Loans.  Each
Lender selling a participating interest
to any Person other than an Affiliate or Related Fund of such Lender in
any Loan, Note, Commitment or other interest under this Agreement, will, within
10 Domestic Business Days of such sale, provide the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent with written notification stating that such sale has
occurred and identifying the Participant and the interest purchased by such
Participant.  The Borrowers agree that
each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Article 8 with respect to
its participation in Loans outstanding from time to time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more commercial
banks or other financial institutions organized under laws of the United States
of America or any state and having total assets in excess of $5,000,000,000 or
an affiliate of any such bank or any other financial institution reasonably
acceptable to Administrative Agent in its sole discretion (each an "Assignee")
all or a proportionate part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement,
the Notes and the other Loan Documents, and such Assignee shall assume all such
rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, executed by
such Assignee, such transferor Lender and the Administrative Agent (and, in the
case of an Assignee that is not then a Lender or a Related Fund or Affiliate of
such Lender, subject to clause (iii) below, by the Borrowers); <u>provided</u>
that (i) no interest may be sold by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph (c)
unless the Assignee shall agree to assume ratably equivalent portions of the
transferor Lender's Commitment, (ii) if a Lender is assigning only a portion of
its Commitment, then, the amount of the Commitment being assigned (determined
as of the effective date of the assignment) shall be in an amount not less than
$5,000,000, (iii) no interest may be sold by a Lender pursuant to this
paragraph (c) to any Assignee that is not then a Lender (or an Affiliate or
Related Fund of a Lender) without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and, unless a Default or Event of Default is in existence, the
Borrower (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and
(iv) a Lender may not have more than 3 Assignees that are not then Lenders (or
an Affiliate or Related Fund thereof) at any one time.  Upon (A) execution of the Assignment and Acceptance
by such transferor Lender, such Assignee, the Administrative Agent and (if
applicable) the Borrowers, (B) delivery of an executed copy of the Assignment
and Acceptance to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, (C) payment by
such Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase
price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, (D) payment of a
processing and recordation fee to the Administrative Agent in the amount of
$1,000, if the Assignee is an Affiliate or Related Fund of a Lender, or $3,500,
for any other Assignee, and (E) recordation of such assignment on the Register,
as defined and provided below, such Assignee shall for all purposes be a Lender
party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a
Lender under this Agreement to the same extent as if it were an original party
hereto with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the
transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a
corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by the Borrowers, the
Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be required.  The Borrowers hereby designate the
Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrowers' agent, solely for purposes of
this Section 10.08(c), to maintain a register (the "Register") on which it will
record the Commitments from time to time of each of the Lenders, the Loans made
by each of the Lender and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of
the Loans of each Lender.  Failure to
make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation shall not affect
the Borrowers' obligations in respect of such Loans.  With respect to any Lenders, the transfer of any Commitment of
such Lenders and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan
shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register
maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such
Commitment and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the
transferor with respect to such Commitment and Loans shall remain owing to the
transferor.  The registration of
assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitment and Loans shall be
recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance
by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to this Section 10.08(c).
Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Acceptance to the
Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer
of all or part of a Commitment and/or Loan, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note
evidencing such Commitment and/or Loan, and thereupon one or more new Notes in
the aggregate principal amount so assigned shall be issued to the new Lender
and, if applicable, a new Note shall be issued to the assigning or transferor
Lender in the remaining aggregate principal amount of its Commitment and/or
Loan not so assigned.  The Borrower
agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature which may be
imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in
performing its duties under this Section 10.08(c); but excluding any such
losses, claims, damages and liabilities incurred by reason of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent.  Each Lender agrees to indemnify the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature which may be imposed on,
asserted against or incurred by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent by
reason of the inaccuracy of any information which is furnished by such Lender
concerning such Lender or its Lending Office or the amount assigned pursuant to
an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the provisions of Section 10.09, the Borrowers
authorize each Lender to disclose to any Participant, Assignee or other
transferee (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all
financial information in such Lender's possession concerning the Borrowers
which has been delivered to such Lender by the Borrowers pursuant to this
Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by the Borrowers in connection
with such Lender's credit evaluation prior to entering into this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Transferee shall be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.13 or 9.03 than the transferor Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made
with the Borrowers' prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of
Section 2.13, 9.02 or 9.03 requiring such Lender to designate a different
Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances
giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything in this Section 10.08 to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of the
Loans and/or obligations owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United
States Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by
such Federal Reserve Bank, provided that any payment in respect of such
assigned Loans and/or obligations made by the Borrowers to the assigning and/or
pledging Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy
the Borrowers' obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Loans and/or
obligations to the extent of such payment.
No such assignment shall release the assigning and/or pledging Lender
from its obligations hereunder.&nbsp;</p>

Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers of same so as to allow the Borrowers
to seek a protective order or to take any other appropriate action; provided,

Severability</a>

<p class=MsoBodyText>.  In case any one
or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement, the Notes or any of the
other Loan Documents should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

<a name="_Toc518986177">SECTION 10.14.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Interest</a>.&nbsp;
<p>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In no event shall the amount of interest, and all charges,
amounts or fees contracted for, charged or collected pursuant to this
Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents and deemed to be interest under
applicable law (collectively, "Interest") exceed the highest rate of interest
allowed by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"), and in the event any such
payment is inadvertently received by any Lender, then the excess sum (the
"Excess") shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrowers
shall notify such Lender in writing that it elects to have the Excess returned
forthwith.  It is the express intent
hereof that the Borrowers not pay and the Lenders not receive, directly or
indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may
legally be paid by the Borrowers under applicable law.  The right to accelerate maturity of any of
the Loans does not include the right to accelerate any interest that has not
otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders do not intend to collect any unearned interest in the
event of any such acceleration.  All
monies paid to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under any
of the Notes or the other Loan Documents, whether at maturity or by prepayment,
shall be subject to rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required
by applicable law.  By the execution of
this Agreement, each of the Borrowers covenants, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, that (i) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute
the acceptance by the Borrowers of such Excess, and (ii) the Borrowers shall
not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, based in whole or in part upon contracting
for charging or receiving any Interest in excess of the Maximum Rate.  For the purpose of determining whether or
not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, all interest at any time contracted for,
charged or received from the Borrowers in connection with this Agreement, the
Notes or any of the other Loan Documents shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts
throughout the full term of the Commitments.
The Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall, to the
maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (x) characterize any non-principal
payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as Interest and (y) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof.
The provisions of this Section shall be deemed to be incorporated into
each Note and each of the other Loan Documents (whether or not any provision of
this Section is referred to therein).
All such Loan Documents and communications relating to any Interest owed
by the Borrowers and all figures set forth therein shall, for the sole purpose
of computing the extent of obligations hereunder and under the Notes and the
other Loan Documents be automatically recomputed by the Borrowers, and by any
court considering the same, to give effect to the adjustments or credits
required by this Section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to O.C.G.A. Sec.7-4-2, the Borrowers, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the only charges imposed or to be
imposed by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders upon the Borrowers for the
use of money in connection with the Loans is and will be the interest required
to be paid under the provisions of Section 2.07 of this Agreement and the
related provisions of the Notes, and that the fees payable pursuant to Section
2.08 are and shall be deemed to be compensation for services and are not and
shall not be deemed to be interest or any other charge for the use, forbearance
or detention of money.&nbsp;</p>
