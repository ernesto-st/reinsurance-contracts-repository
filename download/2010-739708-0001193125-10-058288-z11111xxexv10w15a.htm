Term Loan, a Tranche B Term Loan, a Tranche C Term Loan, a Delayed Draw 1 Term Loan, a Delayed Draw
2 Term Loan, a Dollar Revolving Credit Borrowing, an Alternative Currency Revolving Credit
Borrowing, a conversion of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, or a
continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (ii)&nbsp;the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or
continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii)&nbsp;the principal amount of
Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv)&nbsp;the currency in which the Loans to be borrowed
are to be denominated, (v)&nbsp;the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans or
Revolving Credit Loans are to be converted, (vi)&nbsp;if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period

such Revolving Credit Loans are being borrowed under the Dollar Revolving Credit Facility or the
Alternative Currency Revolving Credit Facility and (viii)&nbsp;in the case of Alternative Currency
Revolving Credit Loans, whether the borrower shall be the Parent Borrower or one of the Foreign
Subsidiary Revolving Borrowers. If the relevant Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a
Committed Loan Notice or fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation,

Rate Loans (unless the Loan being made or continued is denominated in an Alternative Currency, in
which case it shall be made or continued as a Eurocurrency Rate Loan with an Interest Period of one
month). Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of
the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If the
relevant Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate
Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period (or fails to give
a timely notice requesting a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative
Currency), it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1)&nbsp;month. If no currency

Obligations and Swing Line Loans held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through
the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share
contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a)&nbsp;notify the Administrative Agent
of such fact, and (b)&nbsp;purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them
and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by
them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess
payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of
them; <I>provided </I>that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the
purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section&nbsp;10.06 (including pursuant to
any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to
that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase
price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender&#146;s ratable share (according
to the proportion of (i)&nbsp;the amount of such paying Lender&#146;s required repayment to (ii)&nbsp;the total
amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by
the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest
thereon. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender
may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of setoff, but subject to Section&nbsp;10.10) with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such
participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding
in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section&nbsp;2.13 and will in
each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that
purchases a participation pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the
right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this

appropriate form was not delivered or not property executed, or because such Lender failed to
notify the Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of
withholding tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Agent (to the

that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in
particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative
Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any
of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any
other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent
is hereby authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative

individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a &#147;<B>Supplemental Administrative

enable such Supplemental Administrative Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with
respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every
covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or
performance thereof by such Supplemental Administrative Agent shall run to and be enforceable by
either the Administrative Agent or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, and (ii)&nbsp;the provisions
of this Article&nbsp;IX and of Sections&nbsp;10.04 and 10.05 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall

any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent. In case any
Supplemental Administrative Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting,

Agreement is binding upon them. Each Lender (a)&nbsp;hereby consents to the subordination of the Liens
on the Receivables Collateral securing the Obligations on the terms set forth in the Intercreditor
Agreement, (b)&nbsp;hereby agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary to the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and (c)&nbsp;hereby authorizes and instructs the
Administrative Agent to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and to subject the Liens on the
Receivables Collateral securing the Obligations to the provisions thereof. The foregoing
provisions are intended as an inducement to the ABL Secured Parties (as such term is defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) to extend credit to the borrowers under the ABL Credit Agreement and such
ABL Secured Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of such provisions and the provisions of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.01. <U>Guarantee</U>. The Company unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor
and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment and performance of the Obligations, in
each case, whether such Obligations are now existing or hereafter incurred under, arising out of
any Loan Document whether at stated maturity or earlier, by reason of acceleration, mandatory
prepayment or otherwise in accordance herewith or with any other Loan Documents. The Company
further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice
to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any
extension or renewal of any Obligation. The Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from
and protest to any Borrower or other Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice
of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.02. <U>Guarantee of Payment</U>. The Company further agrees that its guarantee
hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right
to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any
security held for the payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit
on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of any Borrower or any
other Person.

Section&nbsp;4.13, the obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction,
limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release,
surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off,
counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or

Obligations; (iv)&nbsp;any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the

the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of the Company as a matter of Law or
equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations). The Company expressly
authorizes the Secured Parties to take and hold security for the payment and performance of the
Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without
consideration), to enforce or apply such security and direct the order and manner of any sale
thereof in their sole discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or

the Obligations. The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may in accordance with the
terms of the Collateral Documents, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more
of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in
lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation
with any Borrower or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them
against any Borrower or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the
liability of the Company hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully paid in
full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company waives any defense
arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable Law, to
impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the
Company against any Borrower or any other Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security.

continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part
thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent
or any other Secured Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any other Loan
Party or otherwise.

in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at
Law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrower or any
other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity,
by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will

punctual payment and performance of the Obligations, in each case, whether such Obligations are now
existing or hereafter incurred under, arising out of any Loan Document whether at stated maturity
or earlier, by reason of acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise in accordance herewith or
with any other Loan Documents. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the Obligations may be
extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it
will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.
Each of the Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower or
any other Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its
guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.

any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party
to any security held for the payment of the Obligations, or to any balance of any deposit account

surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off,
counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the

expressly authorizes the Secured Parties to take and hold security for the payment and performance
of the Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without
consideration), to enforce or apply such security and direct the order and manner of any sale
thereof in their sole discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or

the Obligations. The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may in accordance with the
terms of the Collateral Documents, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more
of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in

with any Borrower or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them
against any Borrower or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the
liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully and
indefeasibly paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates,
pursuant to applicable Law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or
other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any Borrower or any other Loan Party, as the case
may be, or any security.

Parties together with the net worth of the Claiming Party on the date hereof (or, in the case of
any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.14, the date of the Guarantee Agreement
Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Party making any

subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations; <I>provided </I>that if any

its signature below becomes a Guarantor under the Guarantee Agreement with the same force and
effect as if originally named therein as a Guarantor and the New Subsidiary hereby (a)&nbsp;agrees to
all the terms and provisions of the Guarantee Agreement applicable to it as a Guarantor thereunder
and (b)&nbsp;represents and warrants that the representations and warranties made by it as a Guarantor

or hereafter incurred under, arising out of any Loan Document whether at stated maturity or

reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of
waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any
defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall
not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (i)&nbsp;the failure of the Administrative
Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
remedy under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii)&nbsp;any rescission, waiver,
amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any

other Secured Party for the Obligations; (iv)&nbsp;any default, failure or delay, willful or
otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (v)&nbsp;any other act or omission that may
or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate
as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of Law or equity (other than the indefeasible
payment in full in cash of all the Obligations). Each Guarantor expressly authorizes the
Secured Parties to take and hold security for the payment and performance of the
Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without
consideration), to enforce or apply such security and direct the order and manner of any
sale thereof in their sole discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other
guarantors or obligors upon or in respect of the Obligations, all without affecting the
obligations of any Guarantor hereunder.

the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation
from any cause of the liability of any Borrower or any other Loan Party, other than the
indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. The Administrative Agent and
the other Secured Parties may in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents, at
their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more
judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of
foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation
with any Borrower or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to
them against any Borrower or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way
the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been
fully and indefeasibly paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such
election operates, pursuant to applicable Law, to impair or to extinguish any right of
reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any Borrower
or any other Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security.

extent permitted by applicable law, its contribution right against any other Guarantor to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer, any Cash
Management Bank, any Hedge Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or
under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps
to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent,
the L/C Issuers, the Cash Management Banks, the Hedge Banks and the Lenders hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or
consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;4.02, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan, issuance of
a Letter of Credit, provision of Cash Management Services or entering into Secured Hedge
Agreements shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Cash Management Bank, any Hedge Bank or any L/C Issuer
may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any
Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances.

except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative
Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties with respect to which such waiver, amendment or
modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section&nbsp;10.01

together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by facsimile or other electronic
communication of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement shall be effective

also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by facsimile or electronic

the remaining provisions contained herein and in the Guarantee Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any

designated by the Administrative Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties; (ii)&nbsp;occupy
any premises owned or, to the extent lawful and permitted, leased by any of the Grantors where the
Collateral or any part thereof is assembled or located for a reasonable period in order to

deem appropriate. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall not have

a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the

each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section&nbsp;9-611 of the UCC or its
equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Administrative Agent&#146;s intention to make any sale of
Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such
sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker&#146;s board or on a securities exchange, shall state the
board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion
thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be
held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the
Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the
Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate
parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. The
Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall
determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have
been given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or
private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and
place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to
which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on
credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent
until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent
shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and
pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again
upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by Law, private) sale made pursuant
to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by Law)
from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said
rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by Law), the Collateral or any
part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due
and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such
Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such
property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written
agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the
Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor
shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto,
notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an
agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured Obligations paid in full.

Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at Law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell

shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such

the remaining provisions contained herein and in the Security Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any

invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot

discretion) determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any
Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such

adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by
announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be
made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part
of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained

Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by Law,
private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to

of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by
Law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof
by using any claim then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against
the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold,
retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor. For
purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be
treated as a sale thereof; the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant
to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion
thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have
entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured
Obligations paid in full. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon
it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at Law or in equity to foreclose this
Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a
court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, the

a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any

invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 7. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Supplement should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions contained herein and in the Security Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any
other jurisdiction). The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

sale. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and
at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of
such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot
as an entirety or in sepa
rate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine.
The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall
determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have
been given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or
private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and
place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to
which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on
credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent
until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent
shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and
pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again
upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by Law, private) sale made pursuant
to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by Law)
from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said
rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by Law), the Collateral or any
part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due
and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such
Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such
property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written
agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the
Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor
shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto,
notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an
agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured Obligations paid in full.
As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Administrative
Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at Law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell
the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having
competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale
pursuant to the provisions of this Section&nbsp;4.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially
reasonable standards as provided in Section&nbsp;9-610(b) of the UCC or its equivalent in other

invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction. The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as
close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4.08. <U>Right of Set-Off</U>. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each
Lender and its Affiliates is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to
Holdings, any such notice being waived by Holdings to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, to set-off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender and its
Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of Holdings against any and all obligations owing to
such Lender and its Affiliates hereunder, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not
such Lender or Affiliate shall have made demand under this Agreement and although such obligations
may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable
deposit or Indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify Holdings and the Administrative
Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; <I>provided</I>, that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each
Lender under this Section&nbsp;4.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights
of set-off) that such Lender may have.
