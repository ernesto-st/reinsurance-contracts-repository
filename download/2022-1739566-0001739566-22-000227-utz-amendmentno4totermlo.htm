Section 3.3. This Amendment and each other Loan Document (as amended hereby,  as applicable) have been duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party that is party hereto or thereto,  as applicable. This Amendment and each other Loan Document (as amended hereby, as applicable) con- stitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party, enforceable against each Loan Party that  is party hereto or thereto, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may  be limited by Debtor Relief Laws and by general principles of equity.  Section 3.4. Immediately after giving effect to this Amendment, the representations  and warranties of each Loan Party set forth in Article V of the Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents  are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Fourth Amendment Effective Date; provided  that, to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, they shall  be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date; provided further that any representation  and warranty that is qualified as to &#8220;materiality,&#8221; &#8220;Material Adverse Effect&#8221; or similar language are true  and correct (after giving effect to any qualification therein) in all respects on and as of the Fourth Amend- ment Effective Date or such earlier date, as the case may be.  Section 3.5. At the time of and immediately after giving effect to this Amendment,  no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  ARTICLE IV    Lien Release and Terminations  Section 4.1. Release.  Immediately upon the Fourth Amendment Effective Date, the  Lien on any property of the Loan Parties constituting Fixtures (under and as defined in the UCC) shall be  automatically released.  Section 4.2. Terminations.  The Administrative Agent (or its agents or representa- tives) shall promptly execute, deliver and file all releases, discharges of security interests, terminations,  and other documents, and take any other actions as may be required and/or reasonably requested to evi- dence the consummation of the release contemplated by Section 4.1.  The Borrower (or its agents or rep- resentatives) is hereby authorized to file UCC-3 termination statements evidencing the release set forth in  Section 4.1.  ARTICLE V  Miscellaneous  Section 5.1. Counterparts and eSignatures. This Amendment and any document,  amendment, approval, consent, information, notice, certificate, request, statement, disclosure or authori- zation related to this Amendment (each a &#8220;Communication&#8221;), including Communications required to be  in writing, may be in the form of an Electronic Record and may be executed using Electronic Signatures.   Each of the Loan Parties agrees that any Electronic Signature on or associated with any Communication  shall be valid and binding each of the Loan Parties to the same extent as a manual, original signature, and  that any Communication entered into by Electronic Signature, will constitute the legal, valid and binding  -4-    obligation of each of the Loan Parties enforceable against such in accordance with the terms thereof to the  same extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered.  Any Communication may be  executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic coun- terparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication.  For the avoidance of doubt, the  authorization under this paragraph may include, without limitation, use or acceptance by the Administra- tive Agent and each of the Lenders of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted  into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed Communication con- verted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. The Administrative Agent and each  of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or more copies of any Communication in the form of an  imaged Electronic Record (&#8220;Electronic Copy&#8221;), which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of  such Person&#8217;s business, and destroy the original paper document.  All Communications in the form of an  Electronic Record, including an Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and  shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record.  Notwithstanding anything  contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to accept an Electronic  Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant  to procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (a) to the extent the Ad- ministrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of  the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf  of any Loan Party without further verification and (b) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any  Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.  For  purposes hereof, &#8220;Electronic Record&#8221; and &#8220;Electronic Signature&#8221; shall have the meanings assigned to  them, respectively, by 15 USC &sect;7006, as it may be amended from time to time.  Section 5.2. Applicable Law.  THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND  OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED  AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  Section 5.3. Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury.  SECTION 10.15 OF THE CREDIT  AGREEMENT IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, MUTATIS MUTANDIS.  Section 5.4. Headings.  The headings of this Amendment are for purposes of refer- ence only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.  Section 5.5. Acknowledgement and Reaffirmation of Guarantors.  The Guarantors  acknowledge and agree that this Amendment and all documents executed in connection herewith do not  operate to reduce or discharge the Guarantors&#8217; obligations under the Loan Documents.  Each Guarantor  hereby ratifies and confirms its obligations under the Loan Documents, including the Collateral and Guar- antee Requirement and including, without limitation, its guarantee of the Obligations and its grant of the  security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Collateral Documents) to secure the Obligations.   Section 5.6. Costs and Expenses.  Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.04  of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable and documented out of pocket costs  and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of  this Amendment (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out of pocket expenses of one  counsel for the Administrative Agent with respect thereto).  Section 5.7. Effect of Amendment.  On and after the Fourth Amendment Effective  Date, each reference to the Credit Agreement in any Loan Document (including to any Exhibit or Schedule  attached thereto) shall be deemed to be a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended by this Amend- ment.  As of the Fourth Amendment Effective Date, each reference in the Credit Agreement to &#8220;this  Agreement,&#8221; &#8220;hereunder,&#8221; &#8220;hereof,&#8221; &#8220;herein,&#8221; or words of like import, and each reference in the other  </FONT></DIV>

Except as expressly amended hereby or specifically waived above, (i)  all of the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents are and shall remain  in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed, and (ii) nothing contained herein shall be  construed as a substitution or novation of the obligations outstanding under the Credit Agreement or any  other Loan Document, which obligations shall remain in full force and effect, except in each case as  amended, restated, replaced and superseded hereby or by any instruments executed in connection herewith  or therewith.

(a) Each Term Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and  each continuation of Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans shall be made upon the Borrower&#8217;s  irrevocable notice, to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice  must be received by the Administrative Agent substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A or  any other form that may be approved by the Administrative Agent (including any form on an electronic  platform or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent, (i) in the  case of a Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loan, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, threetwo  (32) Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (ii) in the case of a Base Rate Loan, not  later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of the proposed Borrowing.

(b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall  promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable  Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the  Administrative Agent shall notify each Appropriate Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to  Base Rate Loans or continuation described in Section 2.02(a). In the case of each Borrowing, each  Appropriate Lender shall make (or cause its Applicable Lending Office to make) the amount of its Loan  available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office  for the applicable currency not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable  Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if  such Borrowing is the Credit Extension on the Closing Date, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent  shall, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Committed Loan Notice, make all  funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either  by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent with the amount of  such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to  (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.    (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loan may  be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency RateTerm  SOFR Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.04 in connection therewith.  During the existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may  require that (i) no Loans may be converted to or continued as Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans and  (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan at the  end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.    (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of  the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans upon  determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR by the  Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.    (e) Anything in clauses (a) to (d) above to the contrary notwithstanding, after giving  effect to all Term Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and all  continuations of Term Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in  effect at any time for all Borrowings of Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans.    (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior  to the date of any Borrowing, or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 1:00 p.m.,  New York City time, on the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available to the  Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent  may assume that such Lender has made such Applicable Percentage available to the Administrative Agent  on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with clause (b) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in  reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If  the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall  not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the Borrower  severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount  together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower  until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (a) in the case of the Borrower, the  interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (b) in the case of such  Lender, the greater of (x) the Federal Funds Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent  -67-  #95982248v17   in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing  or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing. A  certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under  this Section 2.02(f) shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. If the Borrower and such  Lender shall both pay all or any portion of the principal amount in respect of such Borrowing or interest  to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall  promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such Borrowing or interest paid by the Borrower for such  period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the  amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the  Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have  failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.    (g) With respect to SOFR or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the  right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary  herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will  become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other  Loan Document; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent  shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the  Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Class(es)  and Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Term SOFR Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of  such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of its receipt of  each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such  notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount  specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a  Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with  any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.04.

(c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest  Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder  shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and  after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.    Section 2.09 Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agents such fees as shall have  been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be  fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever (except as expressly agreed  between the Borrower and the applicable Agent).    Section 2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for  Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by the &#8220;corporate base rate&#8221; shall be made on the  basis of a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days or three hundred sixty six (366) days, as the case  may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of  a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the  day on which such Loan is made, and shall not accrue on such Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day  on which such Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any such Loan that is repaid on the same day  on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one (1) day. Each determination by  the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all  purposes, absent manifest error.    Section 2.11 Evidence of Indebtedness.    (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more  accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by one or more entries in the Register. Any failure to  so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the  Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any  conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall  be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the  Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative  Agent) a Term Note payable to such Lender or its registered assigns, which shall evidence such Lender&#8217;s  Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Term Note and  endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with  respect thereto.    Section 2.12 Payments Generally.    (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or  deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided  herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the  account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative  Agent&#8217;s Office in Dollars and in Immediately Available Funds not later than 3:00 p.m. on the date  specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable  Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by  wire transfer to such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative  Agent after 3:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable  interest or fee shall continue to accrue.    -77-  #95982248v17   (b) Except as set forth in the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221;, if any payment to be  made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the  next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees,  as the case may be.    (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior  to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the  Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may  assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may  (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person  entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent  in immediately available funds, then:    (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, then the applicable Lender agrees  to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the portion of such assumed payment  that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest  thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by  the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative  Agent in immediately available funds at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate  determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank  compensation, it being understood that nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from  its obligation to fulfill its Term Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative  Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender  hereunder; and    (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on  demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds,  together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the  Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative  Agent (the &#8220;Compensation Period&#8221;) at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined  by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank  compensation. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all  accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which  may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s  Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith  upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand  therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative  Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at the interest rate applicable to  such Loan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its  Term Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower  may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.    A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any  amount owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent demonstrable error.    (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to  be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not  made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable  Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof,      -78-  </FONT></DIV>

(e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several and not  joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required  hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no  Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its  participation.    (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for  any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has  obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.    (g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this  Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable  to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by  the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.04. If the  Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in  respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the  manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated  to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender&#8217;s Applicable  Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment  of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender.    Section 2.13 Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere  herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it any payment (whether voluntary,  involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or  other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative  Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by  them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such  Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided that (x) if all or any  portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the  circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the  purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender  shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to  such paying Lender&#8217;s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender&#8217;s  required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or  other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered,  without further interest thereon, (y) the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to  any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this  Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a  participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant and (z) the provisions of this Section 2.13  shall not be construed to apply to any disproportionate payment obtained by a Lender of any Class as a  result of the extension by Lenders of the maturity date or expiration date of some but not all Loans or  Term Commitments of that Class or any increase in the Applicable Rate (or other pricing term, including  any fee, discount or premium) in respect of Loans or Term Commitments of Lenders that have consented  to any such extension to the extent such transaction is permitted hereunder. The Borrower agree that any  Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by  applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section  10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the  -79-  #95982248v17   Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall  be conclusive and binding in the absence of demonstrable error) of participations purchased under this  Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each  Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase  have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this  Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the  purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.    Section 2.14 Incremental Credit Extensions.    (a) At any time and from time to time, subject to the terms and conditions set forth  herein, the Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (whereupon the Administrative Agent  shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), request to increase the amount of Term Loans or  add one or more additional tranches of term loans (any such Term Loans or additional tranche of term  loans, the &#8220;Incremental Term Loans&#8221; or the &#8220;Incremental Facilities&#8221;). Notwithstanding anything to  contrary herein, the aggregate principal amount of all Incremental Facilities (other than Refinancing Term  Loans) (determined at the time of incurrence), together with the aggregate principal amount of all  Permitted Alternative Incremental Facilities Debt, shall not exceed the sum of (i) the Unrestricted  Incremental First Lien Amount plus (ii) the amount of any voluntary prepayments, repurchases,  redemptions or other retirements of the Term Loans effected after the Closing Date (including pursuant to  debt buy-backs made by any Parent, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to &#8220;Dutch  Auction&#8221; procedures and open market purchases permitted hereunder, in an amount equal to the  discounted amount actually paid in respect thereof, but excluding (A) any prepayment of Term Loans  with the proceeds of substantially concurrent borrowings of new Loans hereunder and (B) prepayments  with the proceeds of substantially concurrent incurrence of other long term Indebtedness (other than  borrowings under the ABL Facility or other revolving indebtedness)) (this clause (ii), the &#8220;Voluntary  Prepayment Amount&#8221;) plus (iii) unlimited additional Incremental Facilities and Permitted Alternative  Incremental Facilities Debt so long as, after giving Pro Forma Effect thereto and after giving effect to any  Permitted Acquisition consummated in connection therewith and all other appropriate Pro Forma  Adjustments (but excluding the cash proceeds of any such Incremental Term Loans), the First Lien Senior  Secured Leverage Ratio for the most recently ended Test Period shall not exceed 4.00:1.00 (or, to the  extent such Incremental Term Loans are incurred in connection with any Permitted Acquisition or similar  Investment not prohibited by the Loan Documents, the First Lien Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for the  most recently ended Test Period does not exceed the greater of 4.00:1.00 and the First Lien Senior  Secured Leverage Ratio immediately prior to such Permitted Acquisition or permitted Investment) (other  than (x) amounts incurred concurrently with the incurrence of Indebtedness incurred in reliance on the  Unrestricted Incremental First Lien Amount and/or the Voluntary Prepayment Amount and (y) amounts  incurred concurrently or substantially concurrently with the incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to  drawings under the ABL Facility, in which case the First Lien Senior Secured Leverage Ratio may exceed  4.00:1.00, as a result of the incurrence of such amounts, and it being understood that Incremental  Facilities may be incurred pursuant to this clause (iii) prior to utilization of the Unrestricted Incremental  First Lien Amount and the Voluntary Prepayment Amount) (this clause (iii), the &#8220;Incremental Incurrence  Test&#8221;). Each Incremental Facility shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and be in an aggregate  principal amount that is not less than $5,000,000, provided that such amount may be less than the  applicable minimum amount if such amount represents all the remaining availability hereunder as set  forth above. Each Incremental Facility shall have the same guarantees as, and be secured on a pari passu  basis by the same Collateral securing, all of the other Obligations hereunder.    (b) Any Incremental Term Loans (other than Refinancing Term Loans) (i) for  purposes of prepayments, shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably  than) the Initial Term Loans, (ii) shall have interest rate margins and (subject to clauses (iii) and (iv))  -80-  </FONT></DIV>

The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby  acknowledge and agree that the provisions of Sections 2.05, 2.06 and 2.13 do not apply to the Permitted  Debt Exchange and the other transactions contemplated by this Section 2.17 and hereby agree not to  assert any Default or Event of Default in connection with the implementation of any such Permitted Debt  Exchange or any other transaction contemplated by this Section 2.17.    (c) In connection with each Permitted Debt Exchange, the Borrower shall provide  the Administrative Agent at least five (5) Business Days&#8217; (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the  Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent,  acting reasonably, shall mutually agree to such procedures as may be necessary or advisable to  accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.17; provided that the terms of any Permitted Debt Exchange  Offer shall provide that the date by which the relevant Lenders are required to indicate their election to  participate in such Permitted Debt Exchange shall be not less than five (5) Business Days following the  date on which the Permitted Debt Exchange Offer is made. The Borrower shall provide the final results  of such Permitted Debt Exchange to the Administrative Agent no later than three (3) Business Days prior  to the proposed date of effectiveness for such Permitted Debt Exchange (or such shorter period agreed to  by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to  conclusively rely on such results.    (d) The Borrower shall be responsible for compliance with, and hereby agrees to  comply with, all applicable securities and other laws in connection with each Permitted Debt Exchange, it  being understood and agreed that (i) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender assumes any  responsibility in connection with the Borrower&#8217;s compliance with such laws in connection with any  Permitted Debt Exchange and (ii) each Lender shall be solely responsible for its compliance with any  applicable &#8220;insider trading&#8221; laws and regulations to which such Lender may be subject under the  Exchange Act.

(a) Except as provided in this Section 3.01, any and all payments by the Borrower or  any Guarantor to or for the account of any Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made  free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes unless required by applicable Law. If any  applicable withholding agent shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any  sum payable under any Loan Document to any Agent or any Lender, (i) if such Taxes are Indemnified  Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower or applicable Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that  after all required deductions have been made (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable  under this Section 3.01), each of such Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it  would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such applicable withholding agent shall  make such deductions, (iii) such applicable withholding agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the  relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within thirty  (30) days after the date of such payment by such applicable withholding agent (or, if receipts or evidence  are not available within thirty (30) days, as soon as possible thereafter), such applicable withholding  agent shall furnish to Borrower and such Agent or Lender (as the case may be) the original or a facsimile  -87-  #95982248v17   copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other  written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.    (b) In addition, but without duplication of any amounts payable pursuant to Section  3.01(a) or (c), the Borrower agrees to pay all Other Taxes.    (c) Without duplication of any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or  Section 3.01(b), the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of  Indemnified Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction in respect of  amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable by such Agent and such Lender and (ii) any reasonable  expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Indemnified Taxes  were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Such Agent or  Lender, as the case may be, will, at the Borrower&#8217;s request, provide the Borrower with a written statement  thereof setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such amounts which shall be  conclusive absent manifest error. Payment under this Section 3.01(c) shall be made within ten (10) days  after the date such Lender or such Agent makes a demand therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in this Section 3.01(c), no Loan Party shall be required to indemnify any Agent or any  Lender pursuant to this Section 3.01(c) for any incremental interest, penalties or expenses resulting from  the failure of such Agent or Lender to notify the Loan Party of such possible indemnification claim within  180 days after such Agent or Lender receives written notice from the applicable taxing authority of the  specific tax assessment giving rise to such indemnification claim.    (d) If any Lender or Agent determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has  received a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts  have been paid to it by the Borrower or any Guarantor pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly  remit an amount equal to such refund as soon as practicable after it is determined that such refund pertains  to Indemnified Taxes (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by  the Borrower or any Guarantor under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise  to such refund plus any interest included in such refund by the relevant taxing authority attributable  thereto) to the Borrower, net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Lender  or Agent, as the case may be and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant taxing  authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Lender or  Agent, as the case may be, agree promptly to return an amount equal to such refund (plus any applicable  interest, additions to tax or penalties) to such party in the event such party is required to repay such refund  to the relevant taxing authority. Such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall, at the Borrower&#8217;s  request, provide the Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the  requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant taxing authority (provided that such Lender  or Agent may delete any information therein that such Lender or Agent deems confidential). Nothing  herein contained shall interfere with the right of a Lender or Agent to arrange its Tax affairs in whatever  manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Lender or Agent to claim any Tax refund or to make available its Tax  returns or disclose any information relating to its Tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or  require any Lender or Agent to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other  refunds, credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled.    (e) Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the  operation of Section 3.01(a) or (c) with respect to such Lender it will, if requested by the Borrower, use  commercially reasonable efforts (subject to legal and regulatory restrictions), at Borrower&#8217;s expense, to  designate another Applicable Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event; provided that such  efforts are made on terms that, in the judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Applicable  Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further,    -88-  </FONT></DIV>

Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which  determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the  Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the  Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:    (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month,  three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR, including, without limitation, because  the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such  circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or    (ii) CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a  Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator  with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a  public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month  interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be made  available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of U.S. dollar denominated  syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement,  there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will  continue to provide such interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date  on which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term  SOFR Screen Rate are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the &#8220;Scheduled  Unavailability Date&#8221;);    then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the  &#8220;Term SOFR Replacement Date&#8221;), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant  interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no  later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan  Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest  calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to,  or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the  &#8220;Successor Rate).    -91-  #95982248v17   If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest  payments will be payable on a monthly basis.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent  determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or  (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.02(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with  respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower  may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Successor  Rate in accordance with this Section 3.02 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date  or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due  consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit  facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark. and, in each case,  including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any  evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and  agented in the United States for such benchmark, which adjustment or method for calculating such  adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from  time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt,  any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a &#8220;Successor Rate&#8221;. Any such amendment shall  become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted  such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising  the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required  Lenders object to such amendment.    The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and  each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate.    Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice;  provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative  Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the  Administrative Agent.    Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined  would otherwise be less than 0.00%, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0.00% for the purposes of  this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.    In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent, in  consultation with the Borrower, will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and,  notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments  implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of  any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the  Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the  Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.    For purposes of this Section 3.02, those Lenders that either have not made, or do not have  an obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in Dollars shall be excluded from any  determination of Required Lenders.              -92-  </FONT></DIV>

(b) If any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law regarding capital  adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the Closing Date, or  compliance by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the  rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence  of such Lender&#8217;s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital  adequacy and such Lender&#8217;s desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such  Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return  (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.05), the  Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such  reduction within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such demand.    (c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be  required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency  funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan  equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such  Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error), and  (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous  requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the  maintenance of the Term Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans, such  additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest  five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Term Commitment or Loan by such Lender  (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent  demonstrable error) which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable  on such Loan, provided, the Borrower shall have received at least fifteen (15) days&#8217; prior notice (with a  copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or cost from such Lender.

(e) If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 3.03, then such Lender  will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Applicable  Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event; provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in  the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Applicable Lending Office(s) to suffer  no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; and provided further that nothing in this Section  3.03(e) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender  pursuant to Section 3.03(a), (b), (c) or (d).

Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the  Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and  hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any EurocurrencyLoan  other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or    (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to  make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan (other than a Base Rate Loan) on the date  or in the amount notified by the Borrower;    including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to  maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.

Section 3.05 Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation.    (a) Any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article III shall  deliver a certificate to the Borrower setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it  hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. In determining such amount,  such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.    (b) With respect to any Lender&#8217;s claim for compensation under Section 3.01, Section  3.02, Section 3.03 or Section 3.04, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender for any  amount incurred more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies  the Borrower of the event that gives rise to such claim; provided that, if the circumstance giving rise to  such claim is retroactive, then such 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the  period of retroactive effect thereof. If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under Section  3.03, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the  obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans from one Interest  Period to another, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans, until the  event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of      -94-  </FONT></DIV>

(d) If any Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative  Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.01, Section 3.02, Section 3.03 or Section 3.04 hereof  that gave rise to the conversion of such Lender&#8217;s Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans denominated in  Dollars pursuant to this Section 3.05 no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such  circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans made by other  Lenders are outstanding, such Lender&#8217;s Base Rate Loans shall be automatically converted to  Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for  such outstanding Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect  thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans and by such Lender  are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest Periods) in accordance with their  respective principal amount of Term Commitments.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein  or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities, except  those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any  fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions,  responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan  Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

Each Lender also represents that it  will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents  and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,  appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,  prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and  the other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be  furnished to the Lenders by any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to  provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,  property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their  respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.    Section 9.07 Indemnification of Agents. Whether or not the transactions  contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related  Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the  obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and  against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it in its capacity as an Agent-Related Person;  provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of  such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Agent-Related Person&#8217;s own gross negligence or willful  misconduct, as determined by the final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction;  provided that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders (or such other  number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be required by the Loan Documents) shall be deemed to  constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section 9.07. In the case of any  investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 9.07 applies  whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand  for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the  Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,  modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise)  of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan  Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative  Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower, provided that such  reimbursement by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrower&#8217;s continuing reimbursement obligations with  respect thereto, if any. The undertaking in this Section 9.07 shall survive termination of the Aggregate  Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.    Section 9.08 Agents in their Individual Capacities. Bank of America and its  Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire  Equity Interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or  other business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though Bank of America  were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The  Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive  information regarding any Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party (including information that may be  subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that  the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect  to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other  -139-  #95982248v17   Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the  terms &#8220;Lender&#8221; and &#8220;Lenders&#8221; include Bank of America in its individual capacity.    Section 9.09 Successor Agents. The Administrative Agent may resign as the  Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent upon thirty (30) days&#8217; notice to the Lenders and the Borrower.  If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from  among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which appointment of a successor agent shall  require the consent of the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default  under Section 8.01(f) or (g) (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed). If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the  Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the  Borrower, a successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as  successor agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights,  powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent and the term &#8220;Administrative  Agent&#8221; shall mean such successor administrative agent and/or supplemental administrative agent, as the  case may be (and the term &#8220;Collateral Agent&#8221; shall mean such successor collateral agent, as described in  this Section 9.09 and/or supplemental agent, as described in Section 9.02), and the retiring Administrative  Agent&#8217;s appointment, powers and duties as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall be  terminated. After the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation hereunder as the Administrative Agent  and Collateral Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and Section 10.04 and Section 10.05 shall inure to  its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent and  Collateral Agent under this Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as the  Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following the retiring  Administrative Agent&#8217;s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation shall  nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the  Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders  appoint a successor agent as provided for above (except that in the case of any collateral security held by  the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Collateral  Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is  appointed). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent  hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or  amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the  Required Lenders may reasonably request, in order to (a) continue the perfection of the Liens granted or  purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents or (b) otherwise ensure that the Collateral and  Guarantee Requirement is satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become  vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent  and Collateral Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall, to the extent not  previously discharged, be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.    Section 9.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the  pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,  adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent  (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by  declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any  demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or  otherwise:    (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing  and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such  other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the  Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and  -140-  </FONT></DIV>

The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the  direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including accepting  some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of  foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition  vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the  Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar  Laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, (b) at any other sale or foreclosure or  acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the  Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable Law.  In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be  entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or  unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that would vest  upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent  claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the  Equity Interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate  such purchase). In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form  one or more acquisition vehicles to make a bid, (ii) to adopt documents providing for the governance of  the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to  such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or Equity Interests thereof  shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the Required Lenders, irrespective of the  termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required  Lenders contained in clauses (a) through (g) of Section 10.01), (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be  authorized to assign the relevant Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle pro rata by the Lenders, as a  result of which each of the Lenders shall be deemed to have received a pro rata portion of any Equity  Interests and/or debt instruments issued by such an acquisition vehicle on account of the assignment of  the Obligations to be credit bid, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take  any further action, and (iv) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not  used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the  amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit bid by the  acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro  rata and the Equity Interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of the  Obligations that had been assigned to the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be canceled, without the  need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action.    Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to  authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization,  -141-  #95982248v17   arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to  authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.    Section 9.11 Collateral and Guaranty Matters. The Lenders irrevocably agree:    (a) that any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or  the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document shall be automatically released (i) upon termination of the  Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification  obligations and other contingent obligations not yet accrued and payable), (ii) at the time the property  subject to such Lien is transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with any transfer  permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person other than any other Loan Party,  (iii) subject to Section 10.01, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by  the Required Lenders, (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of  such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guaranty pursuant to clause (c) below or (v) if the property  subject to such Lien becomes Excluded Property;    (b) to release or subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on  such property that is permitted by Sections 7.01(i) and (o);    (c) if any Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or becomes an  Excluded Subsidiary, in each case as a result of a transaction or designation permitted hereunder (as  certified in writing delivered to the Administrative Agent by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower), (x)  such Subsidiary shall be automatically released from its obligations under the Guaranty and (y) any Liens  granted by such Subsidiary or Liens on the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary (to the extent such Equity  Interests have become Excluded Property or are being transferred to a Person that is not a Loan Party)  shall be automatically released.    Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will  confirm in writing the Administrative Agent&#8217;s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular  types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to  this Section 9.11. In each case as specified in this Section 9.11, the Administrative Agent will promptly  (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower&#8217;s expense, execute  and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to  evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest  granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations  under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section  9.11. Prior to releasing or subordinating its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release  any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.11, the Administrative  Agent and/or the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to receive a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the  Borrower stating that such actions are permitted under this Agreement. Neither the Administrative Agent  nor the Collateral Agent shall be liable for any such release undertaken in reliance upon any such  certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower.    The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Lenders or to any other  Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Loan Party or is cared for, protected or  insured or that the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent herein or pursuant hereto have been properly or  sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority,  or to exercise or to continue exercising at all or in any manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or  fidelity any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to the Collateral Agent in this  Section 9.11 or in any of the Collateral Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the  -142-  </FONT></DIV>

Section 9.12 Other Agents; Arrangers and Managers. None of the Lenders, the  Agents, the Lead Arrangers or other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this  Agreement as a &#8220;joint lead arranger and bookrunner&#8221; or &#8220;co-arranger&#8221; shall have any right, power,  obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders  as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or  be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not  relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this  Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.    Section 9.13 Appointment of Supplemental Administrative Agents.    (a) It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall  be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or  associations to transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of  litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the  enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent deems that by reason of  any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies  granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or  necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to appoint an additional  individual or institution selected by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee,  co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any  such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a &#8220;Supplemental  Administrative Agent&#8221; and, collectively, as &#8220;Supplemental Administrative Agents&#8221;).    (b) In the event that the Administrative Agent appoints a Supplemental  Administrative Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty  expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested  in or conveyed to the Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and  vest in such Supplemental Administrative Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable  such Supplemental Administrative Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to  such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and  obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such  Supplemental Administrative Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Administrative Agent or  such Supplemental Administrative Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Article IX and of Section 10.04  and Section 10.05 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental  Administrative Agent and all references therein to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be  references to the Administrative Agent and/or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, as the context  may require.    (c) Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be required by any  Supplemental Administrative Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent for more fully and  certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrower  shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments  promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent. In case any Supplemental Administrative Agent, or  a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers,  -143-  #95982248v17   privileges and duties of such Supplemental Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall  vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental  Administrative Agent.    Section 9.14 Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable Law, the  Administrative Agent may deduct or withhold from any payment to any Lender under any Loan  Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or  any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly  withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because  the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to  notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or  reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the  Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as  Tax or otherwise, and shall make payable in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefore  including any penalties, additions to Tax or interest and together with all expenses (including legal  expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred, whether or not such Tax was  correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the  amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be  conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and  apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan  Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.14. The agreements in  this Section 9.14 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any  assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of this Agreement and the  repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.14  shall not limit or expand the obligations of the Borrower or any Guarantor under Section 3.01 or any  other provision of this Agreement.    ARTICLE X    Miscellaneous    Section 10.01   Amendments, Etc. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,  no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no  consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in  writing signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may  be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent and each such waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided that no such  amendment, waiver or consent shall:    (a) extend or increase the Term Commitment of any Lender without the written  consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (it being understood that a waiver of any  condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 or the waiver of any Default, mandatory prepayment or  mandatory reduction of the Term Commitments shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Term  Commitment of any Lender);    (b) postpone any date scheduled for, or reduce the amount of, any payment of  principal or interest under Section 2.07 or Section 2.08, fees or other amounts without the written consent  of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, it being understood that the waiver of (or  amendment to the terms of) any mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans shall not constitute a  postponement of any date scheduled for the payment of principal or interest;    -144-  </FONT></DIV>

Furthermore, with the consent of the Administrative Agent at the request of the Borrower (without the  need to obtain any consent of any Lender), any Loan Document may be amended to cure ambiguities,  omissions, mistakes or defects.    Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall amend or waive any  provision of an Applicable Intercreditor Agreement (other than to cure ambiguities, omissions, mistakes  or defects or to add other parties thereto (to the extent contemplated by Section 7.01)) without the written  consent of the Required Lenders.

In maintaining the Participant Register, such Lender shall be  acting as the non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower solely for this purpose (without limitation, in no event  shall such Lender be a fiduciary of the Borrower for any purpose). No Lender shall have any obligation to  disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any  Participant or any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans, or its other  obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that  such commitment, loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103(c) of the United  States Treasury Regulations and, if different, under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code.    (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section  3.01, 3.03 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the  participation sold to such Participant.

To the extent  that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or  any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221;, and each such  QFC, a &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution  power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II  of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations  promulgated thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and  QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and  any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of  the United States or any other state of the United States):    (a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a &#8220;Covered  Party&#8221;) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such  Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under  such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported  QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the  transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such  QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws  of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of  a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights  under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit  Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater  extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the  Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the  United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of  the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party  with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.  (b) As used in this Section 10.27, the following terms have the following meanings:  &#8220;BHC Act Affiliate&#8221; of a party means an &#8220;affiliate&#8221; (as such term is defined under, and  interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.    &#8220;Covered Entity&#8221; means any of the following: (i) a &#8220;covered entity&#8221; as that term is  defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 252.82(b); (ii) a &#8220;covered bank&#8221; as  that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 47.3(b); or (iii) a &#8220;covered  FSI&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 382.2(b).    &#8220;Default Right&#8221; has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in  accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.    &#8220;QFC&#8221; has the meaning assigned to the term &#8220;qualified financial contract&#8221; in, and shall  be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).    -164-  </FONT></DIV>
