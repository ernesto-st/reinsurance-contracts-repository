<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.15 <U>Agent for Service</U>. The Borrowers have irrevocably designated, appointed, and
empowered CT Corporation System, with an office on the date hereof at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York,
New York 10011 as its designee, appointee and agent to receive and accept for and on its behalf,
service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents which may be served in any
action, suit or proceedings brought against the Borrowers in any United States or State of New York
court. If for any reason such designee, appointee and agent hereunder shall cease to be available
to act as such, the Borrowers agree to designate a new designee, appointee and agent in the Borough
of Manhattan, The City of New York on the terms and for the purposes of this &#167;15.15 satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent. Each Borrower further hereby irrevocably consents and agrees to the
service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents in any action, suit or
proceeding against each Borrower by serving a copy thereof upon the relevant agent for service of
process referred to in this &#167;15.15 (whether or not the appointment of such agent shall for any
reason prove to be ineffective or such agent shall accept or acknowledge such service) or by
mailing copies thereof by registered or certified air mail, postage prepaid, to such Borrower at
its address specified in &#167;15.7 hereof. Each Borrower agrees that the failure of any such designee,
appointee and agent to give any notice of such service to it shall not impair or affect in any way
the validity of such service or any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon.
Nothing herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the ability of the Lenders or the Administrative
Agent to serve any such legal process, summons, notices and documents in any other manner permitted
by applicable law or to obtain jurisdiction over the Borrowers or bring actions, suits or
proceedings against the Borrowers in such other jurisdictions, and in such manner, as may be
permitted by applicable law. Each of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which
they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions, suits or
proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Reimbursement and Pledge Agreement or any
other Loan Document brought in the United States Federal courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York or the courts of the State of New York and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any
such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. The Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders each waive personal service of any
summons, complaint or other process and irrevocably consent to the service of process by registered
mail, postage prepaid, or by any other means permitted by New York or federal law.

used by the Administrative Agent prevailing on the Business Day preceding the day on which the
judgment is given or (as the case may be) the order is made. In the event that there is a
difference between the rate of exchange on the basis of which the amount of such judgment or order
is determined and the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, then the rate of exchange
prevailing on the date of payment shall govern the amount owing hereafter, and each Borrower agrees

due under this Reimbursement and Pledge Agreement in Dollars before such judgment was obtained or
made. Any amount due from a Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders under the
second sentence of this &#167;15.16 will be due as a separate debt of such Borrower to the
Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, shall constitute an Obligation hereunder and shall not be

when executed and delivered shall be an original, and all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. Delivery by facsimile by any of the parties hereto of an executed counterpart hereof

any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed
the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the &#147;Maximum Rate&#148;). If the
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such
unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable Borrower. In determining whether the interest
contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum
Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a)&nbsp;characterize any payment that
is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b)&nbsp;exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c)&nbsp;amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or

U.S. withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code. Thereafter
and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A)&nbsp;promptly submit to the Administrative
Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor
forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as

this Agreement with respect to Customer&#146;s use of the System, the terms of this Exhibit&nbsp;C shall

Customer a personal, nontransferable and nonexclusive license to use the Software and the System
solely for the purpose of transmitting Written Instructions, receiving reports, making inquiries or
otherwise communicating with Custodian in connection with the Account(s). Customer shall use the
Software and the System solely for its own internal and proper business purposes and not in the
operation of a service bureau. Except as set forth herein, no license or right of any kind is
granted to Customer with respect to the Software or the System. Customer acknowledges that
Custodian and its suppliers retain and have title and exclusive proprietary rights to the Software
and the System, including any trade secrets or other ideas, concepts, know-how, methodologies, or
information incorporated therein and the exclusive rights to any copyrights, trademarks and patents
(including registrations and applications for registration of either), or other statutory or legal
protections available in respect thereof. Customer further acknowledges that all or a part of the
Software or the System may be copyrighted or trademarked (or a registration or claim made therefor)
by Custodian or its suppliers. Customer shall not take any action with respect to the Software or
the System inconsistent with the foregoing acknowledgments, nor shall Customer attempt to
decompile, reverse engineer or modify the Software. Customer may not copy, sell, lease or provide,
directly or indirectly, any of the Software or any portion thereof to any other person or entity

its use of the System, delivery of such database to Customer shall constitute the granting by
Custodian to Customer of a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use such database for so long
as this Exhibit&nbsp;C is in effect. It is understood and agreed that any database supplied by
Custodian is derived from sources which Custodian believes to be reliable but Custodian does not,
and cannot for the fees charged, guarantee or warrant that the data is correct, complete or
current. All such databases are provided as an accommodation by Custodian to its customers and are
compiled without any independent investigation by Custodian. However, Custodian will endeavor to
update and revise each database on a periodic basis as Custodian, in its discretion, deems
necessary and appropriate. Customer also agrees that Customer will

procedures are intended to determine whether instructions received by Custodian through the System
are authorized but are not (unless otherwise specified in writing) intended to detect any errors
contained in such instructions. Customer will cause all persons utilizing the Software and the
System to treat all applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and authentication keys with
the highest degree of care and confidentiality. Custodian is hereby irrevocably authorized to

its sole responsibility to assure that only Authorized Persons use the System and that to the

CUSTOMER MAY NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES RESELL, DIVERT, TRANSFER, TRANSSHIP OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE
