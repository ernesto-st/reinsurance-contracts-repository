case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted
herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are hereby authorized to appoint one or more additional
individual(s) or institution(s) selected by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any
such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a &#147;<B>Supplemental Agent</B>&#148; and collectively as &#147;<B>Supplemental Agents</B>&#148;). </P>

Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant
and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Collateral Agent or such Supplemental Agent, and (ii)&nbsp;the provisions of
this <U>Article&nbsp;IX</U> and of <U>Sections&nbsp;10.04</U> and <U>10.05</U> that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Agent and all references therein to the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be
references to the Collateral Agent and/or such Supplemental Agent, as the context may require. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) Should any instrument in writing from
any Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, such Loan Party
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent. In case any Supplemental Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or
be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Agent. </P>

&#147;IRS&#148;) is currently auditing the tax returns of La Quinta L.L.C., one of our REITs, and LQ Operating Lessee L.L.C., one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, in each case for calendar years 2010 and 2011. On January&nbsp;9, 2014, we received a
draft notice of proposed adjustment from the IRS in the amount of $158 million of additional tax for calendar years 2010 and 2011 in which the IRS has preliminarily asserted that the rent charged for these periods under the lease of hotel properties
from the REIT to the taxable REIT subsidiary exceeded an arm&#146;s length rent. The rent payable under such lease is based on a transfer pricing study prepared by an expert firm, and we believe that all such rent has been on an arm&#146;s length
basis. If, however, the IRS were successful in showing the rent charged was higher than the rent determined under any reasonable method, an excise tax would be imposed on the REIT equal to 100% of the excess rent. Such adjustments could also give
rise to additional state income taxes. The IRS has indicated that it intends to review similar issues with respect to subsequent taxable years of the REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. The IRS may also raise other issues in the course of examining
our tax returns that could result in additional proposed adjustments. </P>
