Unless the 2023 Additional Term A Commitments are otherwise  terminated in accordance with Article VI below prior to such time, the obligation of the 2023  Additional Term A Lenders to fund the 2023 Additional Term A Loans shall be subject solely to  the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with Section 13.1 of the Amended Credit Agreement) of  the following conditions (the date of such funding, the &#8220;Amendment No. 1 Funding Date&#8221;):  a. (x) The Specified Representations and (y) such of the representations made by Seller with  respect to the Acquired Assets in the Acquisition Agreement as are material to the interests  of the 2023 Additional Term A Lenders (in their capacity as such), but only to the extent  that the Borrower (or any of the Borrower&#8217;s Affiliates that is a party to the Acquisition  Agreement) has the right (taking into account any applicable notice and cure provisions)  to terminate its obligations under the Acquisition Agreement or decline to consummate the  Acquisition as a result of a breach of such representations in the Acquisition Agreement  without any liability to the Borrower or its Affiliates, in each case, shall be true and correct  in all material respects (or in all respects if qualified by materiality) immediately prior to,  and immediately after giving effect to, the initial borrowing of the 2023 Additional Term  A Loans.  b.

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the amendment of the Existing Credit Agreement pursuant  to this Amendment and all other Credit Documents amended and/or executed and delivered in connection  herewith shall not constitute a novation of the Existing Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents as  in effect prior to the date hereof.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to establish a precedent for purposes of  interpreting the provisions of the Amended Credit Agreement or entitle any Credit Party to a consent to, or  a waiver, amendment, modification or other change of, any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants  or agreements contained in the Amended Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document in similar or  different circumstances.

The interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determinedby reference to the LIBOR Rate, which is derived from the London interbank offered rate.  The London interbankoffered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings fromeach other in the London interbank market.  In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that,after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to theICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the &#8220;IBA&#8221;) forpurposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate.  As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022,the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate referencerate upon which to determine the interest rate on LIBOR Loans.  In light of this eventuality, public and privatesector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place ofthe London interbank offered ratea Loan denominated in dollars may be derived from an interest rate benchmarkthat may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform.  Upon the occurrenceof a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, Section 2.10(b) provides a mechanism fordetermining an alternative rate of interest.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuantto Section 2.10(d), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is based.However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have anyliability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to the Londoninterbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of &#8220;Adjusted LIBOR Rate&#8221;any interest rate used in thisAgreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including,without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 2.10(b),whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) theimplementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 2.10(c)),, includingwithout limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacementreference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBOR Rateexistinginterest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offeredany existinginterest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.  The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or otherrelated entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any  interest rate used in this Agreement orany alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevantadjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent may selectinformation sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, anycomponent thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of thisAgreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of anykind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses(whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate(or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.66 1.8 Times of Day.

If since thebeginning of such period any Person (that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or intothe Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period) shall have made any Investment,acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation, or disposed operation that would have required adjustment pursuantto this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratioshall be calculated giving Pro Forma Effect thereto for such Test Period as if such Investment, acquisition,disposition, merger, consolidation, or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the Test Period.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into(or consummated) in reliance on a provision of any covenant in this Agreement that does not require compliancewith a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, the Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDARatio) (any such amounts, the &#8220;Fixed Amounts&#8221;) substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred ortransactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the same covenant in this Agreement thatrequires compliance with any such financial ratio or test (any such amounts, the &#8220;Incurrence Based Amounts&#8221;), itis understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts (and any cash proceeds thereof) shall be disregarded in thecalculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence Based Amounts in connection with suchsubstantially concurrent Incurrence.(b) Whenever Pro Forma Effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma calculations shall bemade in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of a Borrower (and may include, for theavoidance of doubt and without duplication, cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies resultingfrom such Investment, acquisition, merger, or consolidation which is being given Pro Forma Effect that have beenor are expected to be realized; provided that such costs savings, operating expense reductions and synergies aremade in compliance with the definition of &#8220;Pro Forma Adjustment&#8221;).  If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate ofinterest and is being given Pro Forma Effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate ineffect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account for such67 entire period, any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness with a remaining term of 12 months orlonger, and in the case of any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness with a remaining term of lessthan 12 months, taking into account such Hedging Obligation to the extent of its remaining term).  Interest on aCapitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsiblefinancial or accounting officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized LeaseObligation in accordance with GAAP.  For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on anyIndebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a Pro Forma Basis shall be computed based upon theaverage daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period (or, if lower, the greater of (i) maximumcommitments under such revolving credit facilities as of the date of determination and (ii) the aggregate principalamount of loans outstanding under such a revolving credit facilities on such date).  Interest on Indebtedness thatmay optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrencyinterbank offeredsecured overnight financing rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rateactually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrower may designate.In connection with any action (other than with respect any Credit Event subject to the conditions set forthin Section 7.1) being taken solely in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of:(i) determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires thecalculation of the Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio or the Fixed Charge CoverageRatio; (ii) determining the accuracy of representations and warranties in Section 8 and/or whether aDefault or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under Section 11; or(iii) testing availability under baskets set forth in this agreement (including baskets measuredas a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets);in each case, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrower&#8217;s election to exercise such option in connection with anyLimited Condition Transaction, an &#8220;LCT Election&#8221;), the date of determination of whether any such action (otherthan with respect any Credit Event subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.1) is permitted hereunder, shall bedeemed to be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (the &#8220;LCTTest Date&#8221;), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactionsto be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceedsthereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date,the Borrower could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket,such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with; provided that, for the purpose of determiningwhether a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under Section 11, such condition shallbe deemed to be satisfied to the extent that on the date of consummation of the relevant Limited ConditionTransaction, no Event of Default under Section 11.1 or Section 11.5 has occurred and is continuing.  For theavoidance of doubt, if the Borrower has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios or baskets for whichcompliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any suchratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower and its RestrictedSubsidiaries or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of therelevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of suchfluctuations.  If the Borrower has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connectionwith any subsequent calculation of any ratio (other than the Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDARatio set forth in Section 10.7) or basket availability with respect to the incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, or themaking of Restricted Payments, mergers, the conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of theassets of the Borrower, the prepayment, redemption, purchase, defeasance or other satisfaction of Indebtedness, orthe designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of(i) the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or (ii) the date that the definitiveagreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such LimitedCondition Transaction, any such ratio (other than the Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio setforth in Section 10.7) or basket shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition68 </FONT></DIV>
