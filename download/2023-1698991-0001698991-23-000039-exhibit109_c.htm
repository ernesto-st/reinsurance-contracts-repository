If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis. (1) (2) Replacing Future Benchmarks.

Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(1) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower.  Except as provided in Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16, each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $250,000 or a whole multiple amount of $250,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(3), 2.04(3), 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16, each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $250,000 or a whole multiple amount of $50,000 in excess thereof.  Each Committed Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify: (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Term Borrowing, a Revolving Borrowing, a conversion of Term Loans or Revolving Loans from one Type to the other or a continuation of Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Class and Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans or Revolving Loans are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (vi) wire instructions of the account(s) to which funds are to be disbursed. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan to be made in a Committed Loan Notice, then the applicable Loans shall be made as Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one (1) month.  If the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made or continued as the same Type of Loan, which if a Eurodollar RateSOFR Loan, shall have a one-month Interest Period.  Any such automatic continuation of Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans.  If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. (2) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic continuation of Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans or continuation of Loans described in Section 2.02(1).  In the case of each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office not later than, in the case of any Borrowing on the Amendment No. 2 Effective Date, 10:00 a.m., New York time, and otherwise, 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice.

(3) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar RateSOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar RateSOFR Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.05 in connection therewith.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Facility Lenders under the applicable Facility may require by notice to the Borrower that no Loans under such Facility may be converted to or continued as Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans. (4) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate.  The determination of the Eurodollar RateAdjusted Term SOFR by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  At any time when Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the Administrative Agent&#8217;s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. (5) After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all Revolving Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans or Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans or Revolving Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent; provided that, after the establishment of any new Class of Loans pursuant to an Incremental Amendment, a Refinancing Amendment, an Extension Amendment or an amendment in respect of Replacement Loans, the number of Interest Periods otherwise permitted by this Section 2.02(5) shall increase by three (3) Interest Periods for each applicable Class so established. (6) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. (7) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing, or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 1:30 p.m., New York time, on the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such Pro Rata Share and such other applicable share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (2) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the Borrower severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (a) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (b) in the case of such Lender, the Overnight Rate plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.02(7) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall both pay all or any portion of the principal amount in respect of such Borrowing or interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such Borrowing or interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing.

Upon receipt by the relevant Issuing Bank of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (or, if applicable, for the benefit of Holdings or any Subsidiary of the Borrower) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be.

(c) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the relevant Issuing Bank an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Appropriate Lender&#8217;s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.03(3)(b) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. (d) [Reserved] (e) Until each Appropriate Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(3) to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank. 106 US-DOCS\126387463.20 </FONT></DIV>

A certificate of the relevant Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(3)(g) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(a) If, at any time after an Issuing Bank has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Lender such Lender&#8217;s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(3), the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such Issuing Bank any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender&#8217;s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the amount received by the Administrative Agent. (b) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.03(3)(a) or Section 2.03(3)(b) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Issuing Bank as required above), each Appropriate Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  The Obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this Section 2.03(4)(b) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. (5) Obligations Absolute.

Cash Collateral shall be maintained in controlled accounts at the Administrative Agent and may be invested in readily available Cash Equivalents selected by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are expressly subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Loan Parties or the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as the depository bank and on behalf of the Secured Parties) or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all relevant L/C Obligations, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the deposit accounts at the Administrative Agent as aforesaid, an amount equal to the excess of (A) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (B) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim.

Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04.

(d) Each Revolving Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(3) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (iii) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(3) (but not to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02.  No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay the applicable Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. (e) Swing Line Reports.  For so long as there is any Swing Line Lender other than the Administrative Agent, such Swing Line Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the last Business Day of each calendar month, and on each date that the funding or repayment of a Swing Line Loan by such Swing Line Lender occurs with respect to any such Swing Line Loan, a report in the form of Exhibit R-2, appropriately completed with the information for every Swing Line Loan made by such Swing Line Lender. 113 US-DOCS\126387463.20 </FONT></DIV>

(4) Repayment of Participations. (a) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the relevant Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, such Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender&#8217;s risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by such Swing Line Lender. (b) If any payment received by the relevant Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by such Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to such Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate.  The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of a Swing Line Lender.  The obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause (4)(b) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. (5) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender.  The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans.  Until each Revolving Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. (6) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender.  The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender with notice to the Administrative Agent; provided that no such notice shall be required in the event that the Swing Line Lender is also the Administrative Agent. (7) Provisions Related to Extended Revolving Commitments.  If the Maturity Date shall have occurred in respect of any Class of Revolving Commitments (the &#8220;Expiring Credit Commitment&#8221;) at a time when another Class or Classes of Revolving Commitments is or are in effect with a later Maturity Date (each, a &#8220;Non-Expiring Credit Commitment&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Non-Expiring Credit Commitments&#8221;), then with respect to each outstanding Swing Line Loan, if consented to by the applicable Swing Line Lender, on the earliest occurring Maturity Date such Swing Line Loan shall be deemed reallocated to the Class or Classes of the Non-Expiring Credit Commitments on a pro rata basis; provided that (a) to the extent that the amount of such reallocation would cause the aggregate credit exposure to exceed the aggregate amount of such Non-Expiring Credit Commitments, immediately prior to such reallocation (after giving effect to any repayments of Revolving Loans and any reallocation of Letter of Credit participations as contemplated in Section 2.03(13)) the amount of Swing Line Loans to be reallocated equal to such excess shall be repaid and (b) notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall still be obligated to pay Swing Line Loans allocated to the Revolving Lenders holding the Expiring Credit Commitments at the Maturity Date of the Expiring Credit Commitment or if the Loans have been accelerated prior to the Maturity Date of the Expiring Credit Commitment.

Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. (2) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(1), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, entries in the Register, evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. (3) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Sections 2.11(1) and (2), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Sections 2.11(1) and (2), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error. SECTION 2.12 Payments Generally. (1) All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder shall be made in Dollars (or such other form of consideration as the relevant recipient may agree) without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office for payment and in Same 128 US-DOCS\126387463.20 </FONT></DIV>

The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender&#8217;s Lending Office.  Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 2:00 p.m., New York time (or such later time), shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day (but the Administrative Agent may extend such deadline for purposes of computing interest and fees (but not beyond the end of such day) in its sole discretion whether or not such payments are in process). (2) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. (3) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date, or in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York time, on the date of such Borrowing, any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder (in the case of the Borrower, for the account of any Lender or an Issuing Bank hereunder or, in the case of the Lenders, for the account of any Issuing Bank, Swing Line Lender or the Borrower hereunder), that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then: (a) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender or Issuing Bank shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender or Issuing Bank in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender or Issuing Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect; and (b) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the &#8220;Compensation Period&#8221;) at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing.  If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount, or cause such amount to be paid, to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(3) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

(d) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or fund any participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. (e) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. (f) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.03 (or otherwise expressly set forth herein).

SECTION 2.13 Sharing of Payments.  Other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, if any Lender of any Class shall obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on account of the Loans of such Class made by it or the participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans held by it (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (1) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (2) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans of such Class made by them or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of any principal of or interest on such Loans of such Class or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender&#8217;s ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such paying Lender&#8217;s required repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon.  For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (i) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (ii) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.10) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

On any Incremental Facility Closing Date on which any Incremental Revolving Commitment is effective through any Revolving Commitment Increase, subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions in this Section 2.14, (A) each Incremental Revolving Lender of such Class shall make its Incremental Revolving Commitment available to the Borrower (when borrowed, an &#8220;Incremental Revolving Loan&#8221; and collectively with any Incremental Term Loan, an &#8220;Incremental Loan&#8221;) in an amount equal to its Incremental Revolving Commitment of such Class and (B) each Incremental Revolving Lender shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Incremental Revolving Commitment and the Incremental Revolving Loans made pursuant thereto.

Each request for an Extension Series of Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Commitments proposed to be incurred under this Section 2.16 shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $5.0 million (it being understood that the actual principal amount thereof provided by the applicable Lenders may be lower than such minimum amount), and the Borrower may condition the effectiveness of any Extension Amendment on an Extension Minimum Condition, which may be waived by the Borrower in its sole discretion.  In addition to any terms and changes required or permitted by Sections 2.16(1) and 2.16(2), each of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended pursuant to an Extension Amendment, without the consent of any other Lenders, to the extent necessary to (i) in respect of each Extension Amendment in respect of Extended Term Loans, amend the scheduled amortization payments pursuant to Section 2.07 or the applicable Incremental Amendment, Extension Amendment, Refinancing Amendment or other amendment, as the case may be, with respect to the Existing Term Loan Class from which the Extended Term Loans were exchanged to reduce each scheduled repayment amount for the Existing Term Loan Class in the same proportion as the amount of Term Loans of the Existing Term Loan Class is to be reduced pursuant to such Extension Amendment (it being understood that the amount of any repayment amount payable with respect to any individual Term Loan of such Existing Term Loan Class that is not an Extended Term Loan shall not be reduced as a result thereof), (ii) reflect the existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Commitments, as applicable, incurred pursuant thereto and (iii) modify the prepayments set forth in Section 2.05 to reflect the existence of the Extended Term Loans and the application of prepayments with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.01, (x) each Extension Amendment may, without the consent of any other Loan Party, Agent or Lender, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.16, including to effect technical and corresponding amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (y) at the option of the Borrower in consultation with the Administrative Agent, incorporate terms that would be favorable to existing Lenders of the applicable Class or Classes for the benefit of such existing Lenders of the applicable Class or Classes, in each case under this clause (y), so long as the Administrative Agent reasonably agrees that such modification is favorable to the applicable Lenders.  In connection with any Extension Amendment, the Borrower shall, if reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, deliver customary reaffirmation agreements and/or such amendments to the Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in order to ensure that such Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Commitments are provided with the benefit of the applicable Loan Documents. (5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, on any date on which any Existing Term Loan Class and/or Existing Revolving Class is converted or exchanged to extend the related scheduled maturity date(s) in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Section 2.16, in the case of the existing Term Loans or Revolving Commitments, as applicable, of each Extending Lender, the aggregate principal amount of such existing Loans shall be deemed reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Commitments, respectively, so converted or exchanged by such Lender on such date, and the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Commitments shall be established as a separate Class of Loans, except as otherwise provided under Sections 2.16(1) and (2).

(6) If and to the extent that a Tax Indemnitee, in its sole discretion (exercised in good faith), determines that it has received a refund (whether received in cash or applied as a credit against any other cash Taxes payable) of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes in respect of which it has received indemnification payments or additional amounts under this Section 3.01, then such Tax Indemnitee shall pay to the relevant Loan Party the amount of such refund, net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Tax Indemnitee (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund), and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Loan Party, upon the request of the Tax Indemnitee, agrees to repay the amount paid over by the Tax Indemnitee (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Tax Indemnitee to the extent the Tax Indemnitee is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(6), in no event will the Tax Indemnitee be required to pay any amount to a Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01(6) the payment of which would place the Tax Indemnitee in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Tax Indemnitee would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require a Tax Indemnitee to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. (7) On or before the date the Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower whichever of the following is applicable: (i) if the Administrative Agent is a &#8220;United States person&#8221; within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, two (2) executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Administrative Agent is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding or (ii) if the Administrative Agent is not a &#8220;United States person&#8221; within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, (A) with respect to payments received for its own account, two (2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI and (ii) with respect to payments received on account of any Lender, two executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (together with all required accompanying documentation) certifying that the Administrative Agent is a U.S. branch and may be treated as a United States person for purposes of applicable U.S. federal withholding Tax.  At any time thereafter, the Administrative Agent shall provide updated documentation previously provided (or a successor form thereto) when any documentation previously delivered has expired or become obsolete or invalid or otherwise upon the reasonable request of the Borrower.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(7), the Administrative Agent shall 149 US-DOCS\126387463.20 </FONT></DIV>

Upon receipt of such notice, (a) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans and shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar RateAdjusted Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar RateAdjusted Term SOFR component of the Base Rate with respect to any Base Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar RateAdjusted Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar RateAdjusted Term SOFR.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. SECTION 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. IfSubject to Section 1.12 hereof, if the Administrative Agent (in the case of clause (a) or (b) below) or the Required Lenders (in the case of clause (cb) below) reasonably determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar RateSOFR Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that: (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, 150 US-DOCS\126387463.20 </FONT></DIV>

SECTION 3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans. (1) Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall: (a) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender; (b) subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and any Excluded Taxes); or (c) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than with respect to Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans made by such Lender that is not otherwise accounted for in the definition of &#8220;Eurodollar Rate&#8221; or this clause (1); and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar RateAdjusted Term SOFR (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), increase the cost to such Issuing Bank of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, from time to time within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that such amounts shall only be payable by the Borrower to the applicable Lender under this Section 3.04(1) so long as it is such Lender&#8217;s general policy or practice to demand compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other financing agreements. (2) Capital Requirements.  If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender&#8217;s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender&#8217;s capital or on the capital of such Lender&#8217;s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this 151 US-DOCS\126387463.20 </FONT></DIV>

Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin) actually incurred by it as a result of: (1) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar RateSOFR Loan on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (2) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurodollar RateSOFR Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or (3) any assignment of a Eurodollar RateSOFR Loan on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.07, including any loss or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Eurodollar RateSOFR Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.

If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under Section 3.04, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans from one Interest Period to another Interest Period, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.06(3) shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested. (3) Conversion of Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans.  If any Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.02, 3.03 or 3.04 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of such Lender&#8217;s Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans made by other Lenders, as applicable, are outstanding, such Lender&#8217;s Base Rate Loans shall be automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans of a given Class held by the Lenders of such Class holding Eurodollar RateSOFR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. (4) Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Sections 3.01 or 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender&#8217;s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Section 3.01 or 3.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the event giving rise to such claim and of such Lender&#8217;s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

(2) In each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, there shall be no more than two (2) fiscal quarters in which the cure right set forth in Section 8.04(1) is exercised. (3) There shall be no more than five (5) fiscal quarters in which the cure rights set forth in Section 8.04(1) are exercised during the term of the Facilities; provided that, so long as the Amendment No. 2 Effective Date Term Loan, the Amendment No. 2 Effective Date Revolving Facility and the Additional Term Loan Facility are no longer outstanding, there may be an additional fiscal quarter in which the cure rights set forth in this Section 8.04 are exercised.

If the Administrative Agent requests instructions from the Required Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders; and the Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Lender by reason of so refraining.

The Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all its respective functions and duties hereunder or under the other Loan Documents at any time by giving 30 Business Days prior written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower.  If the Administrative Agent becomes subject to a Lender-Related Distress Event, then the Administrative Agent may be removed as the Administrative Agent at the reasonable request of the Required Lenders.  If the Administrative Agent becomes subject to an Agent-Related Distress Event, then the Borrower may remove the Administrative Agent from such role upon fifteen (15) days&#8217; prior written notice to the Lenders.  Such resignation or removal shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent as provided below.

If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so appointed within such 30 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that the Borrower&#8217;s consent shall not be required if an Event of Default under Section 8.01(1) or, solely with respect to the Borrower, Section 8.01(6) has occurred and is continuing), shall then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above. If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant to the foregoing by the 45th Business Day after the date such notice of resignation was given by the Administrative Agent or such notice of removal was given by the Required Lenders or the Borrower, as applicable, the Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation shall nonetheless become effective and the Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.  The retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender or Issuing Bank directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section 9.11.

The Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent are hereby authorized to enter into, and shall enter into, any Intercreditor Agreement to the extent contemplated by the terms hereof, and the parties hereto acknowledge that each such Intercreditor Agreement is and shall be binding upon them.  Each Secured Party (a) hereby agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements, (b) hereby authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to enter into the Intercreditor Agreements and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations to the provisions thereof and (c) without any further consent of the Lenders, hereby authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to negotiate, execute and deliver on behalf of the Secured Parties any intercreditor agreement or any amendment (or amendment and restatement) to the Collateral Documents or any Intercreditor Agreement contemplated hereunder (including any such amendment (or amendment and restatement) of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or other intercreditor agreement to provide for the incurrence of any Indebtedness permitted hereunder that will be secured on a junior lien or pari passu basis to the Obligations).  In addition, each Secured Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into (i) any amendments to any Intercreditor Agreements, and (ii) any other intercreditor arrangements, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) to the extent required to give effect to the establishment of intercreditor rights and privileges as contemplated and required or permitted by this Agreement (including any such amendment (or amendment and restatement) of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or other intercreditor agreement to provide for the incurrence of any Indebtedness permitted hereunder that will be secured on a junior lien or pari passu basis to the Obligations).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. SECTION 9.18 Withholding Tax.  To the extent required by any applicable Laws, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 3.01, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such 217 US-DOCS\126387463.20 </FONT></DIV>

Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Non-Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Non-Excluded Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.07(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or sub participations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable Pro Rata Share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full Pro Rata Share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Share.

The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Agent and, with respect to its own Loans, any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. This Section 10.07(c) and Section 2.11 shall be construed so that all Loans are at all times maintained in &#8220;registered form&#8221; within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and any related Treasury regulations (or any other relevant or successor provisions of the Code or of such Treasury regulations).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender is an Affiliated Lender, nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to monitor the aggregate amount of the Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders.

Subject to subsection (e) of this Section 10.07, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 (subject to the requirements of Section 3.01 (including subsections (2), (3) and (4), as applicable) as though it were a Lender; provided that any forms required to be provided under Section 3.01(3) shall be provided solely to the participating Lender), 3.04 and 3.05 (through the applicable Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 10.07.  To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.10 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant shall agree to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent.
