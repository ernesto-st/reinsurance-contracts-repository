<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Reinsurance Commutation and Release Agreement</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">This Reinsurance Commutation and Release Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the

Jersey, through Chubb Re, Inc., Bernardsville, New Jersey (hereinafter referred to as &#147;Chubb Re&#148;).
The Company and Chubb Re are sometimes referred to individually as a &#147;Party&#148; and collectively as
the &#147;Parties.&#148;



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">WHEREAS, the Company and Chubb Re entered into the Whole Account Net Quota Share Reinsurance

(hereinafter referred to collectively as the &#147;Treaty&#148;);



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">WHEREAS, the Company ceded and Chubb Re assumed a 45.0% share in the terms and conditions under the
Treaty for the period April&nbsp;1, 2003 through December&nbsp;31, 2003 (the &#147;2003 Contract Year&#148;);



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">WHEREAS, the Company and Chubb Re have agreed to cancel and commute the 2003 Contract Year as of
January&nbsp;1, 2005, fully and finally settle, commute and discharge any and all of their respective
obligations and liabilities under the 2003 Contract Year, and enter into mutual releases relating
thereto;



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, assumptions, promises, payments, agreements and
other good and valuable consideration recited as set forth herein, the sufficiency of which is
acknowledged, the Parties agree to the following:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Article&nbsp;I &#151; Consideration</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In consideration for commuting the 2003 Contract Year, the Company shall receive a commutation
profit commission of $34,545,668.40 which shall be deemed to equal 45.0% of the balance of the
Funds Withheld Account associated with the 2003 Contract Year under the provisions of the Treaty.
Chubb Re shall retain 45.0% of the Reinsurer&#146;s Expense Allowance paid under the 2003 Contract Year
(being 45.0% of 4.0% of the 2003 Contract Year Ceded Net Written Premium). Such amounts shall be
deemed to be fully earned by Chubb Re. Further, the Company acknowledges that receipt of such
commutation profit commission constitutes a full and final settlement of all obligations of Chubb
Re to the Company under the 2003 Contract
Year, and that no further amounts are or will be owed to the Company by Chubb Re for the 2003
Contract Year.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Article&nbsp;II &#151; Mutual Release</B>
