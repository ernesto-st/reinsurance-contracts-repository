other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by Lender or its agents. No failure or delay on the part of Lender or any holder of any Note in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under the
Note or any other Loan Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or
