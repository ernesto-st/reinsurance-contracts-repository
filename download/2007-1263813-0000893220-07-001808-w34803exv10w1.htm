injunctive relief arising in connection with
a prospective violation by Executive of the
provisions hereof relating to

on the terms and conditions set forth below, and in reliance upon the representations and covenants
of the Participant set forth below. Unless sooner exercised as provided for in the Plan or this

(including Cause), vesting ceases (other than with respect to Options that have vested
provisionally as of such date of termination under the terms of the Employment Agreement), the term
of unvested Options lapses and such unvested Options will expire immediately. If the Participant&#146;s
Employment terminates for Cause, vested Options will also expire immediately. If the Participant&#146;s
Employment terminates for any reason other than for Cause (including as a result of the
Participant&#146;s resignation), the Options shall expire on the earlier of the following occasions:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Participant may exercise all or part of the Options at any time before its expiration
under this Section&nbsp;3.1, but only to the extent that the Options have vested and become exercisable
before the Participant&#146;s Employment terminated. In the event that the Participant dies after
termination of Employment, but before the expiration of the Options, all of the Options may be
exercised (prior to expiration) by the executors or administrators of the Participant&#146;s estate by
any person who has acquired the Options directly from the Participant by beneficiary designation,
bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent that the Options have vested and become exercisable
before the Participant&#146;s Employment terminated.
