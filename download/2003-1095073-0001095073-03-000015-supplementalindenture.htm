REINSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of
Delaware (hereinafter called the &#147;Corporation&#148;, which term includes any
successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby
promises to pay to [_______________], or registered assigns, the principal sum of
[__________] Dollars on November 15, 2032 [if the Security is a Global Security, then
insert, if applicable &#151; , or such other principal amount represented hereby as may be
set forth in the records of the Securities Registrar hereinafter referred to in accordance
with the Indenture]. The Corporation further promises to pay interest on said principal
sum from November 14, 2002, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which
interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly (subject to deferral as set forth
herein) in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year,
commencing February&nbsp;15, 2003, at the rate of 7.85% per annum, together with
Additional Sums, if any, as provided in Section 10.6 of the Indenture until the principal
hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment; provided, however, that
any overdue principal, premium or Additional Sums and any overdue installment of interest
(whether as a result of the Corporation&#146;s election of an Extension Period or
otherwise) shall bear Additional Interest at the rate of 7.85% per annum (to the extent
that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), compounded quarterly,
from the dates such amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment;
provided further, that no Additional Sums shall accrue or be payable in respect of
Subordinated Debt Securities distributed to holders of Preferred Securities in connection
with a dissolution of the Trust. The amount of interest payable for any full interest
period will be computed by dividing the rate per annum by four. The amount of interest
payable for any partial interest period shall be computed on the basis of the number of
days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual number of days
elapsed in a partial month in such period. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or
duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be
paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest
installment. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith
cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to
the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of
Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be
paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any
securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such
notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Corporation shall have the
right, at any time during the term of this Security, from time to time to defer the
payment of interest on this Security for up to 20 consecutive quarterly interest payment
periods with respect to each deferral period (each, an &#147;Extension Period&#148;),
during which Extension Periods the Corporation shall have the right to make no payments or
partial payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date, and at the end of which the
Corporation shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid including any Additional
Interest, as provided below; provided, however, that no Extension Period shall extend
beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security and no such Extension Period
may end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date; and provided, further, however,
that (A) during any such Extension Period, (B) during the continuance of an Event of
Default or (C) during the continuance of an Event of Default (as defined in the Guarantee
Agreement described in the Trust Agreement), the Corporation shall not and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries not to (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or
redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the
Corporation&#146;s capital stock, or (ii) make any payment of principal of or interest or
premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities of the Corporation
that rank pari passu in all respects with or junior in interest to this Security or make
any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by the Corporation of the debt
securities of any Subsidiary of the Corporation if such guarantee ranks pari passu or
junior in interest to the Securities (other than in the case of (i) and (ii), (a)
repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar
arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or
consultants, in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan
or in connection with the issuance of capital stock of the Corporation (or securities
convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock) as consideration in an acquisition
transaction entered into prior to the applicable Extension Period or Event of Default, (b)
repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions as a result of an exchange or conversion of
any class or series of the Corporation&#146;s capital stock (or any capital stock of a
Subsidiary of the Corporation) for any class or series of the Corporation&#146;s capital
stock or of any class or series of the Corporation&#146;s indebtedness for any class or
series of the Corporation&#146;s capital stock, (c)&nbsp;the purchase of fractional
interests in shares of the Corporation&#146;s capital stock pursuant to the conversion or
exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged,
(d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any Rights Plan, or the issuance of
rights, stock or other property under any Rights Plan, or the redemption or repurchase of
rights pursuant thereto, or (e) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or
other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such
warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being
paid or ranks pari passu with or junior to such stock). Prior to the termination of any
such Extension Period, the Corporation may further defer the payment of interest,
provided, however, that no Extension Period shall exceed 20 consecutive quarterly interest
payment periods, extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security or
end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date. Upon the termination of any such
Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Corporation may elect to begin a new
Extension Period, subject to the above conditions. No interest shall be due and payable
during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but each installment of interest
that would otherwise have been due and payable during such Extension shall bear Additional
Interest (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at
the rate of 7.85% per annum, compounded quarterly and calculated as set forth in the first
paragraph of this Security, from the dates on which amounts would otherwise have been due
and payable until paid or made available for payment. The Corporation shall give the
Holder of this Security and the Trustee notice of its election to begin any Extension
Period at least one Business Day prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date on
which interest on this Security would be payable but for such deferral or so long as such
Securities are held by Everest Re Capital Trust, at least one Business Day prior to the
earlier of (i) the next succeeding date on which Distributions on the Preferred Securities
of such Issuer Trust would be payable but for such deferral, and (ii) the date on which
the Property Trustee of such Issuer Trust is required to give notice to the New York Stock
Exchange or other applicable self-regulatory agency or to holders of such Preferred
Securities of the record date or the date such Distributions are payable. </FONT></P>

the office or agency of the Corporation maintained for that purpose in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America
as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;
provided, however, that at the option of the Corporation payment of interest may be made
(i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall
appear in the Securities Register, or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds
at such place and to such account as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as
specified in the Securities Register; provided that the Paying Agent shall have received

applicable payment date. </FONT></P>
