By this Agreement the Company obligates itself to cede to the Reinsurer and the         Reinsurer  obligates  itself  to  accept  from  the  Company  a  10%  Quota  Share         participation of the Company's Ultimate Net Liability for Policies in force as of July         1, 2020, and new and renewal Policies becoming effective on or after said date as         respects losses occurring on or after July 1, 2020, subject to Paragraph B.  This         Quota Share is subject to the maximum cession limits set forth below:                1.    Property Business                           $[***] each risk (10% share of the Company's Ultimate Net Liability of $[***]),                but in no event shall the Reinsurer's liability from all risks in any one Loss                Occurrence  exceed  $[***]  (10%  of  $[***]).   It  is  understood  that  the                Company's  $[***]  limit  reflects  their  portion  of  the  retention under  the                Company's Catastrophe Excess of Loss Reinsurance Agreement of July 1,                2020  (&quot;Common  Agreement&quot;)  which  also  reinsures  Monarch  National                Insurance Company and Maison Insurance Company (neither of which are                subject to this Agreement).  Should the event from which a Loss Occurrence                hereunder  arises  also  include  losses  sustained  by  Monarch  National                Insurance  Company  and/or  Maison  Insurance  Company  under  the                Common Agreement, the $[***] limit addressed in this paragraph could be                reduced proportionately to reflect the Company&#8217;s retained share of the total                losses under the retention of the Common Agreement.                                Notwithstanding the limits stated above, the Reinsurer's liability shall not                exceed $[***] (10% of $[***]) as respects all Loss Occurrences taking place                during the term of this Agreement.                       2.    Casualty Business               EFFECTIVE: JULY 1, 2020                                   1.

B.     The cession percentage set forth in Paragraph A. of this Article may be adjusted up         to three times during the Agreement Year, subject to the following:             1.    The  Company  has  provided  the  Reinsurer  no  less  than  45  day's  written               notice prior to the end of any calendar quarter during the Agreement Year,               of its desire to adjust the cession percentage prospectively.             2.     The adjusted cession percentage shall not be less than 2% nor greater than               20%.                   3.     The  cession  adjustment  is  to  take  effect  as  respects  in  force,  new  and               renewal business on a prospective basis on the last day of the calendar               quarter in which such notice was given as respects Loss Occurrences taking               place on or after such date;                   4.     Such cession adjustment shall be at the election of the Company only if the               Loss Ratio from Agreement inception through the end of the quarter in which               such notice was given is less than or equal to 30%.                  5.     If such Loss Ratio is greater than 30%, any such cession adjustment must               be mutually agreed by both parties.                   6.     Mutual agreement of the parties to any cession adjustment is evidenced by               addendum to this Agreement signed by both parties.                  For  purposes  of  this  Paragraph  B.,  &quot;Loss  Ratio&quot;  shall  mean  the actual  ratio  of         Incurred Losses to Earned Premiums from Agreement inception to the end of the         calendar quarter for which calculation is being made.  The terms &quot;Incurred Losses&quot;         and &quot;Earned Premiums&quot; shall be defined as they are under Article X - Sliding Scale         Commission,  provided  however,  as  respects  Incurred  Losses,  there  will  be  no         Incurred But Not Reported (&quot;IBNR&quot;) losses included.      C.     Loss Adjustment Expenses and any loss arising under this Agreement with respect         to Loss In Excess of Policy Limits and Extra Contractual Obligations, as defined         herein,  shall  be  recovered  in  the  same  proportion  as  the  contractual  loss         recoverable  hereunder;  provided  such  contractual  loss  plus  Loss  Adjustment         Expenses, Loss In Excess of Policy Limits and Extra Contractual Obligations shall         never exceed the maximum cession limit set forth under Paragraph A. above.   D.     This Agreement is solely between the Company and the Reinsurer, and nothing         contained  in  this  Agreement  shall  create  any  obligations  or  establish  any  rights         against the Reinsurer in favor of any person or entity not a party hereto.    E.     The performance of obligations by both parties under this Agreement shall be in         accordance with a fiduciary standard of good faith and fair dealing.

This Agreement shall become effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Standard  Time, July         1, 2020, and shall terminate at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Standard Time on July 1, 2021.    B.

Alternatively, at the Company's option, and provided written notice of the               Company's election of such option is given to the Reinsurer by certified mail,               electronic mail or by a courier service each producing evidence of receipt               by  the  Reinsurer  prior  to  the  date  of  termination,  this  Agreement  will               terminate on a &quot;Run-off&quot; basis and the Reinsurer shall be liable for losses               occurring  on  or  after  to  the  date  of  termination  for  all  Policies  covered               hereunder and in force at the date of termination of this Agreement until               their  natural  expiry,  cancellation  or  next  anniversary  of  such business,               whichever first occurs; but in no case shall the Reinsurer be liable for losses               occurring  more  than  12  months  after  the  termination  date  unless the               Company  is  required  by  statute  or  regulation  to  continue  coverage  on  a               Policy.

The Reinsurer shall be given written notice of the pendency of each claim or loss         which may involve the reinsurance provided by this Agreement within a reasonable         time after such claim or loss is filed in the insolvency proceedings.

The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer         shall be chargeable, subject to court approval, against the insolvent Company as         part of the expense of liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit         which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by         the Reinsurer.

Although such claim on the         part  of  either  party  against  the  other  may  be  unliquidated  or  undetermined  in         amount on the date of the entry of the receivership or liquidation order, such claim         will  be  regarded  as  being  in  existence  as  of  such  date  and  any claims  then  in         existence and held by the other party may be offset against it.    D.     Nothing contained in this Article is intended to change the relationship or status of         the parties to this Agreement or to enlarge upon the rights or obligations of either         party hereunder except as provided herein.
