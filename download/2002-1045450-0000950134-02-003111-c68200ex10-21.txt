                  SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT

         SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") dated as of
October 31, 2001, between ENTERTAINMENT PROPERTIES TRUST, a real estate
investment trust duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State
of Maryland (the "BORROWER"); Megaplex Four, Inc., a Missouri corporation
("MEGAPLEX OWNER"); Theatre Sub, Inc., a Missouri corporation ("ARCHON SPE
HOLDINGS") (Megaplex Owner and Archon SPE Holdings and such other entities as
may execute a joinder to this Agreement to become a "SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR" are
sometimes referred to individually as a "SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR" and,
collectively, as the "SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS" and, together with Borrower, the
"OBLIGORS"), and SFT II, INC., a Delaware corporation ("LENDER").

                                    RECITALS

         A. Borrower was a party to a certain Credit Agreement dated as of March
2, 1998 (as amended, the "BONY CREDIT AGREEMENT") with, among others, The Bank
of New York ("BONY"), as administrative agent pertaining to a $200,000,000
credit facility (the "BONY FACILITY"). The BONY Facility, the BONY Credit
Agreement and the documents evidencing, securing and/or governing the BONY
Facility were acquired by iSTAR FINANCIAL INC., a Maryland corporation
("ISTAR"). Borrower, the Subsidiary Guarantors and iStar then amended and
restated the BONY Credit Agreement to, among other things, reduce the size of
the credit facility to $50,000,000 and change the term of the BONY Facility, all
pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 18, 2001
among Borrower, the Subsidiary Guarantors, and iStar ("ORIGINAL CREDIT
AGREEMENT").

         B. Pursuant to that certain Assignment and Assumption of Note,
Mortgage, and Other Loan Documents made as of June 7, 2001 by iStar and Lender,
iStar assigned the Loan and all Loan Documents, including the Original Credit
Agreement to Lender.

         C. Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors are engaged as an integrated
group in businesses related to the Permitted Uses (as hereinafter defined). The
integrated operation requires financing on such a basis that credit supplied to
Borrower be made available from time to time to the Subsidiary Guarantors, as
required for the continued successful operation of the Obligors, separately, and
the integrated operation as a whole. In that connection, the Obligors have
requested that Lender amend and restate the Original Credit Agreement to, among
other things, add a third borrowing tranche of $25,000,000, and continue to
extend credit to Borrower (to be made available by Borrower to the Subsidiary
Guarantors) in a new aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding
$75,000,000 to finance the operations of the Obligors for the Permitted Uses.

         D. To induce Lender to so modify and extend such credit, Obligors and
Lender propose to enter into this Agreement, pursuant to which Lender will make
loans to Borrower, and each Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the credit so
extended to Borrower. Each of the Obligors expects to derive benefit, directly
or indirectly, from the credit so extended to Borrower, both in its separate
capacity and as a member of the integrated group, because the successful
operation of each of the Obligors is dependent on the continued successful
performance of the functions of the integrated group as a whole.


<PAGE>

         E. Lender is prepared to so modify and extend such credit upon the
terms and conditions hereof.

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Obligors and Lender hereby amend
and restate the Original Credit Agreement as set forth herein.

         Section 1. Definitions and Accounting Matters.

                  1.01 Certain Defined Terms. As used herein, the following

All Real Estate Properties acquired directly or indirectly by any Obligor within
60 days (before or after) of a draw or advance of Loan proceeds shall be deemed

to time with Lender's written approval or if Securitized Property Owner
refinances its financing with Archon Financial, L.P., then all funds
distributable to Securitized Property Owner from or in any way related to its
assets.

         "AFFILIATE" means any Person that directly or indirectly controls, or
is under common control with, or is controlled by, Borrower and, if such Person
is an individual, any member of the immediate family (including parents, spouse,
children and siblings) of such individual and any trust whose principal
beneficiary is such individual or one or more members of such immediate family
and any Person who is controlled by any such member or trust. As used in this
definition, "CONTROL" (including, with its correlative meanings, "CONTROLLED BY"
and "UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH") means possession, directly or indirectly, of
power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies (whether
through ownership of securities or partnership or other ownership interests, by

directly or indirectly securities having 10% or more of the voting power for the
election of directors or other governing body of a corporation or 10% or more of
the partnership or other ownership interests of any other Person (other than as
a limited partner of such other Person) will be deemed to control such
corporation or other Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) no individual
shall be an Affiliate solely by reason of his or her being a director, officer
or employee of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and (b) none of
the Wholly Owned Subsidiaries of Borrower shall be Affiliates.

                           Default shall have occurred and for so long as such

         the extent otherwise provided therein, all payments to be made by the
         Obligors under any Loan Document, shall be made in Dollars, in
         immediately available funds, without deduction, set-off or
         counterclaim, to Lender at an account maintained by Lender not later

         shall become due (each such payment made after such time on such due
         date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business
         Day).

                  (b) Lender May Set Off. Lender may debit the amount of any
         such payment that is not made by such time to any account of Borrower
         with Lender (with notice to Borrower), provided that Lender's failure
         to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof.

                  (c) Application of Payments. So long as no Event of Default
         then exists, payments of principal and interest shall be allocated
         between the Tranches pro rata in accordance with the principal balance
         of each Tranche immediately prior to the making of the payment. If an
         Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender may apply such
         payments in such manner as it may determine to be appropriate.

                  (d) Extension to Next Business Day. If the due date of any
         payment under this Agreement or any Loan Document would otherwise fall
         on a day that is not a Business Day, such date shall be extended to the
         next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any
         principal so extended for the period of such extension.

                  4.02 Late Payment Charge. If any principal, interest or any
other sums due under the Loan Documents is not paid by Borrower on the date on
which it is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the
lesser of five percent (5%) of such unpaid sum or the Maximum Legal Rate in
order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such
delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such
delinquent payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Mortgages and the
other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by applicable law.

         counterclaim Lender may otherwise have, Lender shall be entitled, at
         Lender's option (to the fullest extent permitted by law),

         provisional or final), or other indebtedness, held by Lender for the
         credit or account of such Obligor at any of its offices, in Dollars or
         in any other currency, against any principal of or interest on any of
         the Loan or any other amount payable to Lender hereunder, that is not
         paid by the due date and the expiration of any applicable cure period
         (regardless of whether such deposit or other indebtedness is then due
         to such Obligor), in which case Lender shall promptly notify such
         Obligor thereof, provided that Lender's failure to give such notice
         shall not affect the validity thereof.

                  (b) Rights of Lender; Bankruptcy. Nothing contained herein
         shall require Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the
         right of Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any
         such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of any
         Obligor.

         Section 5. Yield Protection, Etc.

                  5.01 Limitation on Eurodollar Base Rate. Anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, if:

                  (a) Lender determines, which determination shall be
         conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits
         referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.01
         are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant
         maturities for purposes of determining the Eurodollar Base Rate as
         provided herein; or

                  (b) Lender determines, which determination shall be
         conclusive, that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the
         definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.01 upon the basis of
         which the rate of interest for Loan for such Interest Period is to be
         determined are not likely adequately to cover the cost to Lender of
         making or maintaining Loan for the applicable Interest Period at the
         Eurodollar Base Rate;

then Lender shall give Borrower prompt notice thereof and, so long as such
condition remains in effect, the Loan shall bear interest with the Eurodollar
Base Rate being deemed to be the Base Rate.

                  5.02 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for the Loan to bear interest
at the Eurodollar Base Rate, then Lender shall promptly notify Borrower thereof
and the Loan shall bear interest with the Eurodollar Base Rate being deemed to
be the Base Rate during such period of illegality.

                  5.03 Compensation. Borrower shall pay to Lender upon the
request of Lender, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
reasonable opinion of Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense
that Lender determines is attributable to:

                  (a) any change in an Interest Period by reason of the
         existence of an Event of Default, any prepayment or conversion from the
         Eurodollar Base Rate to the Base Rate for any reason (including the
         acceleration of the Loan pursuant to Section 10) on a date other than
         the last day of the applicable Interest Period; or


                                       28

<PAGE>

                  (b) any failure by Borrower for any reason (including, without
         limitation, the failure of any of the conditions precedent specified in
         Section 7 to be satisfied) to borrow Loan proceeds on the date for such
         borrowing specified in the relevant Notice of Borrowing given pursuant
         to Section 2.02 hereof.

         Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such
compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so
prepaid, converted or not borrowed for the period from the date of such
prepayment, conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current
Interest Period at the applicable rate of interest for the Loan provided for
herein over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on
such principal amount at a Eurodollar Base Rate per annum equal to the
Eurodollar Base Rate that would have been in effect for a one month Interest
Period commencing on the date of the prepayment, conversion or failure to borrow
in question. A certificate of Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         Section 6. Guarantee.

                  6.01 The Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly
and severally guarantee to Lender and its respective successors and assigns the
prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loan made by Lender to, and
the Note held by Lender of, Borrower and all other amounts from time to time
owing to Lender by Borrower or any other Obligor under this Agreement, the Note
and any of the other Loan Documents, in each case strictly in accordance with
the terms hereof or thereof (such obligations being herein collectively called
the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby further jointly
and severally agree that if Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether
at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, the Subsidiary Guarantors will promptly pay the same, without any
demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of
payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be
promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

                  6.02 Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the
Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 6.01 are absolute and unconditional, joint
and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Note or
any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any
substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any
of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or
guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 6.02 that the obligations of the
Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, joint and
several, under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following
shall not alter or impair the liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder,
which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above:


                                       29

<PAGE>

                           (i) at any time or from time to time, without notice
                  to the Subsidiary Guarantors, the time for any performance of
                  or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be
                  extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;

                           (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the
                  provisions of this Agreement or the Note or any other
                  agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be
                  done or omitted;

                           (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed
                  Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed
                  Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any
                  respect, or any right under this Agreement or the Note or any
                  other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein
                  shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the
                  Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be
                  released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt
                  with; or

                           (iv) any lien or security interest granted to, or in
                  favor of, Lender as security for any of the Guaranteed
                  Obligations shall fail to be perfected.

         The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence,
presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any
requirement that Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against
Borrower under this Agreement or the Note or any other agreement or instrument
referred to herein or therein, or against any other Person under any other
guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  6.03 Reinstatement. The obligations of the Subsidiary
Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the
extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of Borrower in respect of
the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any
holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any
proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Subsidiary
Guarantors jointly and severally agree that they will indemnify Lender on demand
for all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees of counsel) incurred by
Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such
costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such
payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under
any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

                  6.04 Subrogation. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and
severally agree that until the indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full of
all Guaranteed Obligations they shall not exercise any right or remedy arising
by reason of any performance by them of their guarantee in Section 6.01, whether
by subrogation or otherwise, against Borrower or any other guarantor of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed
Obligations.

                  6.05 Remedies. The Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally
agree that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors and Lender, the obligations of
Borrower under this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents may be
declared to be forthwith due and



                                       30

<PAGE>

payable as provided in Section 10 (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Section 10) for
purposes of Section 6.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming
automatically due and payable) as against Borrower and that, in the event of
such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically
due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by Borrower)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for purposes
of Section 6.01.

                  6.06 Instrument for the Payment of Money. Each Subsidiary
Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Section 6 constitutes
an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that Lender, at
its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Subsidiary Guarantor in the
payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring motions
and/or actions under New York CPLR Section 3213.

                  6.07 Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Section 6 is
a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever
arising.

                  6.08 Rights of Contribution. The Subsidiary Guarantors and
Borrower hereby agree, as between themselves, that if any Subsidiary Guarantor
shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor (as defined below) by reason of the
payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations, each other
Subsidiary Guarantor and Borrower shall, on demand of such Excess Funding
Guarantor (but subject to the next sentence), pay to such Excess Funding
Guarantor an amount equal to such Subsidiary Guarantor's or Borrower's Pro Rata
Share (as defined below and determined, for this purpose, without reference to
the Properties, debts and liabilities of such Excess Funding Guarantor) of the
Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations. The
payment obligation of a Subsidiary Guarantor and Borrower to any Excess Funding
Guarantor under this Section 6.08 shall be subordinate and subject in right of
payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of (a) such Subsidiary
Guarantor under the other provisions of this Section 6 and (b) Borrower under
the Loan Documents, and such Excess Funding Guarantor shall not exercise any
right or remedy with respect to such excess until payment and satisfaction in
full of all of such obligations.

         For purposes of this Section 6.08, (i) "EXCESS FUNDING GUARANTOR"
means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, a Subsidiary Guarantor that has
paid an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations,
(ii) "EXCESS PAYMENT" means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, the
amount paid by an Excess Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of
such Guaranteed Obligations and (iii) "PRO RATA SHARE" means, for any Subsidiary
Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (x) the amount by which the
aggregate present fair saleable value of all Properties of such Subsidiary
Guarantor (excluding any shares of stock of any other Subsidiary Guarantor)
exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but
excluding the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder and any
obligations of any other Subsidiary Guarantor that have been Guaranteed by such
Subsidiary Guarantor) to (y) the amount by which the aggregate fair saleable
value of all Properties of Borrower and all of the Subsidiary Guarantors exceeds
the amount of all the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated,
unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of
Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder and under the



                                       31

<PAGE>

other Loan Documents) of Borrower and all of the Subsidiary Guarantors,
determined (A) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a party hereto
on the Closing Date, as of the Closing Date, and (B) with respect to any other
Subsidiary Guarantor, as of the date such Subsidiary Guarantor becomes a
Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.

                  6.09 General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any
action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or Federal
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of
creditors generally, if the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under
Section 6.01 would otherwise, taking into account the provisions of Section
6.08, be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or
subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of
its liability under Section 6.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision
hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further
action by such Subsidiary Guarantor, Lender, or any other Person, be
automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and
enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined
in such action or proceeding.

                  6.10 California Waivers.

                  (a) Each Subsidiary Guarantor's liability hereunder is a
         guaranty of payment and performance and is not conditioned or
         contingent upon the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability
         of any of the provisions of the Loan Documents, and each Subsidiary
         Guarantor hereby waives any and all rights, defenses and benefits under
         the California Code of Civil Procedure ("CC") Section 2810 and agrees
         that by doing so such Subsidiary Guarantor is liable even if Borrower
         had no liability at the time of execution of the Loan Documents or
         thereafter ceases to be liable. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives
         any and all rights, defenses and benefits under CC Section 2809 and
         agrees that each Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty
         are independent of the obligations of Borrower. Each Subsidiary
         Guarantor hereby waives any and all rights, defenses and benefits such
         Subsidiary Guarantor may now or hereafter have, under CC Section 2815
         or otherwise, to revoke this guaranty. Each Subsidiary Guarantor
         further hereby waives any and all rights, defenses and benefits that
         such Subsidiary Guarantor may now or hereafter have, under CC Section
         2819, 2825 or otherwise, arising out of any release or discharge of
         Borrower, in whole or in part, from Borrower's liabilities and/or
         obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives any and all
         rights, defenses and benefits under CC Section 2845, 2849 and 2850,
         including, without limitation, the right to require Lender to (a)
         proceed against any other guarantor, (b) proceed against or exhaust any
         security or collateral Lender may hold, or (c) pursue any other right
         or remedy for such Subsidiary Guarantor's benefit, and agrees that
         Lender may proceed against each Subsidiary Guarantor for the Guaranteed
         Obligations without taking any action against any other guarantor and
         without proceeding against or exhausting any security or collateral
         Lender holds. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that Lender may
         unqualifiedly exercise in its sole discretion any or all rights and
         remedies available to it against any other guarantor without impairing
         Lender's rights and remedies in enforcing this guaranty, under which
         each Subsidiary Guarantor's liabilities shall remain independent and
         unconditional. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that Lender's exercise



                                       32

<PAGE>

         of certain of such rights or remedies may affect or eliminate such
         Subsidiary Guarantor's right of subrogation or recovery against
         Borrower and that each Subsidiary Guarantor may incur a partially or
         totally nonreimbursable liability under this guaranty.

                  (c) Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives all rights,
         defenses and benefits under CC Sections 2847, 2848 and 2849 and agrees
         that it shall have no right of subrogation or reimbursement against
         Borrower, and no right of subrogation against any collateral or
         security provided for in the Loan Documents and no right of
         contribution against any other guarantor. To the extent each Subsidiary
         Guarantor's waiver of these rights of subrogation, reimbursement or
         contribution as set forth herein are found by a court of competent
         jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, each Subsidiary
         Guarantor agrees that its rights of subrogation and reimbursement
         against Borrower and such Subsidiary Guarantor's right of subrogation
         against any collateral or security shall be junior and subordinate to
         Lender's rights against Borrower and to Lender's right, title and
         interest in such collateral or security, and each Subsidiary
         Guarantor's right of contribution against any other guarantor shall be
         junior and subordinate to Lender's rights against such other guarantor.

                  (d) Without limitation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
         waives any and all of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement,
         indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and defenses
         that are or may become available to each Subsidiary Guarantor by reason
         of any of the following: Sections 2787 through 2855 of the California
         Civil Code. Without limitation, each Subsidiary Guarantor waives all
         rights and defenses that such Subsidiary Guarantor may have because the
         Borrower's debt to Lender is secured by real property. This means,
         among other things:

                           (i) Lender may collect from each Subsidiary Guarantor
                  without first foreclosing on any real or personal property
                  collateral pledged by the Borrower; and

                           (ii) If Lender forecloses on any real property
                  collateral pledged by Borrower:

                           (A) the amount of the debt of Borrower to Lender may
be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the
foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price; and

                           (B) Lender may collect from each Subsidiary Guarantor
even if Lender, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed
any right any Subsidiary Guarantor may have to collect from Borrower.

This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses each
Subsidiary Guarantor may have because the Borrower's debt to Lender is secured
by real property. These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any
rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d or 726 of the Code of
Civil Procedure.

         recording, in the reasonable judgment of Lender, so as to effectively
         create upon such recording a valid and enforceable Lien in the full
         amount of the Loan upon each of the Initial Megaplex Properties, with
         first priority, in favor of Lender (or such other trustee as may be

         Property is herein called a "PRIOR ENCUMBERED PARCEL"), then:

                           (1) Borrower shall cause Megaplex Owner to form a new
                  wholly owned, single purpose subsidiary in form reasonably

                           (2) Borrower shall cause Megaplex Owner to pledge and
                  grant a security interest to Lender in and to all of the
                  outstanding stock, partnership interests, or membership
                  interests, as the case may be, which Megaplex Owner owns in
                  such single purpose subsidiary, which pledge and security
                  agreement and related documents shall be in form acceptable to
                  Lender and be fully executed and delivered prior to the
                  acquisition of such Prior Encumbered Parcel; and

                           (3) Once the conditions in (a)(1) and (a)(2) above
                  are satisfied, the applicable Megaplex SPE can acquire the
                  Prior Encumbered Parcel; and

                           (4) Within 30 days following the acquisition by such
                  Megaplex SPE of the Prior Encumbered Parcel, Borrower shall
                  cause Megaplex Owner to deliver to Lender a copy, certified by
                  a Financial Officer to be true, complete, and correct, of the
                  closing binder(s) relating to the acquisition, leasing, and
                  financing of such Prior Encumbered Parcel, such closing

                  insurance policy, survey, applicable lease, financing
                  documents, and such other documents and instruments as Lender

         requiring investigation or cleanup.

                  (f) No Liens or Restrictions. To the best of Borrower's
         knowledge, no Liens have arisen under or pursuant to any Environmental
         Laws on any site or facility owned, operated or leased by Borrower or
         any of its Subsidiaries and no Governmental Authority action has been
         taken or is in process that could subject any such site or facility to
         such Liens and none of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has been
         required to place any notice or restriction relating to the presence of
         Hazardous Materials at any site or facility owned by it in any deed to
         the real property on which such site or facility is located.

                  (g) Full Disclosure. All environmental investigations,
         studies, audits, tests, reviews or other analyses that are in the
         possession of Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
         Partially-Owned Entities in relation to facts, circumstances or
         conditions at or affecting any site or facility now or previously
         owned, operated or leased by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have
         been made available to Lender.

                  8.09 Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of Borrower,
its Subsidiaries and, to Borrower's best knowledge, the Properties is in
compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority
or regulatory authority or agency applicable to it or its Property and all
indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its Property,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  8.10 Investment Company Act. Neither Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is an "investment company," or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

                  8.11 Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding
company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

                  8.12 Taxes. Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all
Federal income tax returns and all other tax returns that are required to be
filed by them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns or pursuant
to any assessment received by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The charges,
accruals and reserves on the books of Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect
of taxes and other governmental charges are, in the opinion of Borrower,
adequate. Borrower has not given or been requested to give a waiver of the
statute of limitations relating to the payment of any Federal, state, local and
foreign taxes or other impositions. All of the Borrower's Subsidiaries are
qualified REIT subsidiaries (as defined in the Code) and are not subject to
state or federal income or analogous taxes.

                  8.13 ERISA. Each Plan, and, to the knowledge of Borrower, each
Multiemployer Plan, is in compliance in all material respects with, and has been
administered in all material respects in compliance with, the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other Federal or State law, and no ERISA
Event has occurred and is continuing as to which Borrower would be under an
obligation to furnish a report to Lender under Section 9.02(c).

                  8.14 True and Complete Disclosure. The information, reports,
financial statements, exhibits and schedules, furnished in writing by or on
behalf of Obligors to Lender in connection with the negotiation, preparation or
delivery of the Original Credit Agreement, this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or included herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto or thereto,
when taken as a whole do not contain any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements herein or
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Lender acknowledges that Borrower has relied on information
furnished by tenants under Qualified Leases ("TENANT INFORMATION") for which
Borrower does not represent the accuracy of such Tenant Information




                                       49
<PAGE>

and Borrower has no knowledge that such Tenant Information is incorrect. All
written information furnished after the Original Effective Date by Borrower and
its Subsidiaries to Lender in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will be true,
complete and accurate in every material respect, or (in the case of projections)
based on reasonable estimates, on the date as of which such information is
stated or certified. With respect to any projections furnished to Lender,
Borrower represents and warrants only that the assumptions relating to such
projections are reasonable. There is no fact known to Borrower that could have a
Material Adverse Effect that has not been disclosed herein, in the other Loan
Documents or in a report, financial statement, exhibit, schedule, disclosure
letter or other writing furnished to the Lender for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

                  8.15 Use of Credit. Neither Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in
the business of extending credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental
or ultimate, of buying or carrying Margin Stock, and no part of the proceeds of
any extension of credit hereunder will be used to buy or carry any Margin Stock.

                  8.16 Material Agreements and Liens.

         and correct list of all Investments (other than Investments disclosed
         in Schedule 8.18(b)) held by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in any

                  (c) Subsidiaries Not Subject to Certain Restrictions. None of
         the Subsidiaries of Borrower is, on the date hereof, subject to any
         indenture, agreement, instrument or other arrangement of the type
         described in Section 9.15.

                  8.19 REIT Status. Borrower has not taken any action that would
prevent it from maintaining its qualification as a REIT for its tax year ended

<PAGE>

a Qualified Ground Lease is in default under any material covenant or obligation
set forth in any Qualified Ground Lease.

                  8.22 Leases. Each Megaplex Property and some Pad Properties
are subject to a Qualified Lease. Except for the Loews Lease, each Qualified
Lease (including each applicable third party guaranty) applicable to an
Individual Property is in full force and effect and there exists no default by
Borrower. No lessee under a Qualified Lease has exercised any termination option
under a Qualified Lease.

                  8.23 Westminster and Oakview Purchases. Prior to the Effective
Date, Borrower, Megaplex Owner or an affiliate of Borrower was and is a party to
valid, existing agreements, or in negotiations to enter into agreements, to
acquire (i) fee title to the Oakview Ground and (ii) the membership interests in
Westminster Holdings. Borrower has given Lender true and complete copies of said
agreements or the current draft of such agreements, as applicable, and all
instruments and modifications related thereto and, with respect to binding
agreements, there exists no default by Borrower or its Subsidiaries in
connection with their respective obligations thereunder, nor any condition
which, given notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute a default
or event of default by any of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with their respective obligations thereunder. Neither Borrower nor any
Subsidiary has assigned any of its rights or interest in said agreements to any
party which is not Borrower or a Subsidiary.

                  8.24 Defaults. There is no Default by any Obligor of any of
the Loan Documents.

                  8.25 Absence of Liens. Except for Permitted Liens, the

                  8.26 No Materially Adverse Contracts, Etc. Neither Borrower

conditions of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Obligors and the other
Subsidiaries of Borrower are not a party to any agreement, or otherwise bound by

                                       52
<PAGE>

                  8.28 Title. Borrower (or its Subsidiaries) has good,
marketable and insurable fee simple title or leasehold title, as applicable, to
the real property comprising each Individual Property and good title to the
balance of such Individual Property, free and clear of all Liens whatsoever
except the Permitted Encumbrances, such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to
the Loan Documents and the Liens created by the Loan Documents. The Permitted
Encumbrances in the aggregate do not materially and adversely affect the value,
operation or use of the applicable Individual Property (as currently used) or
Borrower's ability to repay the Loan. Each Mortgage, when properly recorded in
the appropriate records, together with any Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements required to be filed in connection therewith, will create (a) a
valid, perfected first priority lien on the applicable Individual Property,
subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and the Liens created by the Loan
Documents and (b) perfected security interests in and to, and perfected
collateral assignments of, all personality (including the Leases), all in
accordance with the terms thereof, in each case subject only to any applicable
Permitted Encumbrances, such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan
Documents and the Liens created by the Loan Documents. To the best of Borrower's
knowledge, there are no claims for payment for work, labor or materials
affecting the Properties which are or may become a lien prior to, or of equal
priority with, the Liens created by the Loan Documents, other than those claims
with respect to which insurance coverage is provided pursuant to the related
Title Insurance Policy. Except for Lender's interest under the Pledge Agreement,
Borrower is the holder, free and clear, of 100% of the issued and outstanding
common stock of Megaplex Owner. Megaplex Owner is the owner, free and clear, of
100% of the issued and outstanding stock in Archon SPE Holdings. Archon SPE
Holdings is the owner, free and clear, of 100% of the issued and outstanding
stock in Securitization Property Owner. Except for such stock owned in
Securitization Property Owner, Archon SPE Holdings does not own, and will not
own, any other asset or Property. The Pledge Agreement, with delivery of the
appropriate common stock, will create (a) a valid, perfected first priority lien
on the issued and outstanding stock of Megaplex Owner, and (b) perfected
security interests in and to such stock all in accordance with the terms of the
Pledge Agreement.

                  8.29 Solvency. Borrower (a) has not entered into the
transaction or executed the Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents
with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor and (b) received
reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under such Loan
Documents. Giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of Borrower's
assets exceeds and will, immediately following the making of the Loan, exceed
Borrower's total liabilities, including subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and
contingent liabilities. The fair saleable value of Borrower's assets is and
will, immediately following the making of the Loan, be greater than Borrower's
probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities
on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured. Borrower's assets do not
and, immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed
to be conducted. Borrower does not intend to, and does not believe that it will,
incur debt and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other
commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debt and liabilities as they mature
(taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower
and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower).
Except as expressly disclosed to Lender in writing, no petition in bankruptcy
has been filed against Borrower or any Subsidiary in the last seven (7) years,
and neither Borrower nor any constituent Person in the last seven (7) years has
ever made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or taken advantage of any
insolvency act for




                                       53
<PAGE>

the benefit of debtors. Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries are
contemplating either the filing of a petition by it under any state or federal
bankruptcy or insolvency laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of
Borrower's assets or property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Subsidiary
contemplating the filing of any such petition against it or Obligor or any
Subsidiary.

                  8.30 No Plan Assets. Borrower is not an "employee benefit
plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, subject to Title I of ERISA, and
none of the assets of Borrower constitutes or will constitute "plan assets" of
one or more such plans within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101. In
addition, (a) Borrower is not a "governmental plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(32) of ERISA and (b) transactions by or with Borrower are not subject
to state statutes regulating investment of, and fiduciary obligations with
respect to, governmental plans similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code currently in effect, which prohibit or otherwise
restrict the transactions contemplated by this Loan Agreement.

                  8.31 Financial Information. All financial data, including any
statements of cash flow and income and operating expense, that have been
prepared by Borrower or any of its Affiliates or, to the best of knowledge of
Borrower, on behalf of Borrower and delivered to Lender in respect of the
Properties (i) are true, complete and correct in all material respects, (ii)
accurately represent the financial condition of the Properties as of the date of
such reports, and (iii) to the extent prepared or audited by an independent
certified public accounting firm, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
throughout the periods covered, except as disclosed therein. Except for
Permitted Encumbrances, Borrower does not have any contingent liabilities,
liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or unrealized or
anticipated losses from any unfavorable commitments that are known to Borrower
and reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on any Individual
Property or the operation thereof as a megaplex movie theater, except as
referred to or reflected in said financial statements. Since the date of such
financial statements, there has been no materially adverse change in the
financial condition, operations or business of Borrower from that set forth in
said financial statements. Borrower has no reason to believe or suspect that any
financial data provided by or on behalf of any tenant in respect of any of the
Properties and delivered to Lender is not true, complete and correct in all
material respects or does not accurately represent the financial condition of
the related Individual Property as of the date thereof.

                  8.32 Condemnation. No Condemnation or other proceeding has
been commenced or, to Borrower's best knowledge, is threatened or contemplated
with respect to all or any portion of any Individual Property or for the
relocation of roadways providing access to any Individual Property.

                  8.33 Utilities and Public Access. Each Individual Property has
rights of access to public ways and is served by water, sewer, sanitary sewer
and storm drain facilities adequate to service such Individual Property for its
respective intended uses. All public utilities necessary or convenient to the
full use and enjoyment of each Individual Property are located either in the
public right-of-way abutting such Individual Property (which are connected so as
to serve such Individual Property without passing over other property) or in
recorded easements serving such Individual Property and such easements are set
forth in and insured by the Title Insurance




                                       54
<PAGE>

Policies. All roads necessary for the use of each Individual Property for their
current respective purposes have been completed and dedicated to public use and
accepted by all Governmental Authorities.

                  8.34 Not a Foreign Person. No Obligor or any other Subsidiary
of Borrower is a "foreign person" within the meaning of ss.1445(f)(3) of the
Code.

                  8.35 Separate Lots. Each Individual Property is comprised of
one (1) or more parcels which constitute a separate tax lot or lots and does not
constitute a portion of any other tax lot not a part of such Individual
Property.

                  8.36 Assessments. To the best knowledge of Borrower, there are
no pending or proposed special or other assessments for public improvements or
otherwise affecting any Individual Property, nor are there any contemplated
improvements to any Individual Property that may result in such special or other
assessments.

                  8.37 Enforceability. The Loan Documents are not subject to any
right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense by any Obligor, including
the defense of usury, nor would the operation of any of the terms of the Loan
Documents, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render the Loan Documents
unenforceable (subject to principles of equity and bankruptcy, insolvency and
other laws generally affecting creditors' rights and the enforcement of debtors'
obligations), and Obligors have not asserted any right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense with respect thereto.

                  8.38 No Prior Assignment. There are no prior assignments of
the Leases or any portion of the Rents due and payable or to become due and
payable which are presently outstanding.

                  8.39 Insurance. Borrower or the tenant under a Qualified Lease
has obtained and Borrower has delivered to Lender evidence of insurance
reflecting the insurance coverages, amounts and other requirements set forth in
this Agreement. No claims have been made under any insurance policy evidenced by
such certificates and Borrower has not and, to Borrower's best of knowledge, no
other Person, has done, by act or omission, anything which would impair the
coverage of any such policy.

                  8.40 Use of Property. Each Megaplex Property is used
exclusively as a movie theater and for other appurtenant and related uses.

                  8.41 Certificate of Occupancy; Licenses. All certificates of
completion and occupancy permits and, to the best knowledge of Borrower, all
other certifications, permits, licenses and approvals, including any applicable
liquor license required for the legal use, occupancy and operation of each
Individual Property as a megaplex movie theater and all appurtenant and related
uses (collectively, the "Licenses"), have been obtained and are in full force
and effect. Borrower shall keep and maintain, or cause the applicable tenants to
keep and maintain, all licenses necessary for the operation of each Individual
Property as a megaplex movie theater and all appurtenant and related uses. The
use being made of each Individual Property is in conformity with the certificate
of occupancy issued for such Individual Property.



                                       55
<PAGE>

                  8.42 Flood Zone. None of the Improvements on any Individual
Property are located in an area as identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as an area having special flood hazards and, if so located,
the flood insurance required pursuant to Section 9.05 is in full force and
effect with respect to each such Individual Property.

                  8.43 Physical Condition. To the best knowledge of Borrower,
each Individual Property, including all buildings, improvements, parking
facilities, sidewalks, storm drainage systems, roofs, plumbing systems, HVAC
systems, fire protection systems, electrical systems, equipment, elevators,
exterior sidings and doors, landscaping, irrigation systems and all structural
components, are in good condition, order and repair in all material respects;
there exists no structural or other material defects or damages in any
Individual Property, whether latent or otherwise. Borrower has not received
notice from any insurance company or bonding company of any defects or
inadequacies in any Individual Property, or any part thereof, which would
adversely affect the insurability of the same or cause the imposition of
extraordinary premiums or charges thereon or of any termination or threatened
termination of any policy of insurance or bond.

                  8.44 Boundaries. All the improvements located on an Individual
Property lie wholly within the boundaries and building restriction lines of such
Individual Property, and no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon
such Individual Property, and no easements or other encumbrances upon the
applicable Individual Property encroach upon any of the improvements, so as to
affect the value or marketability of the applicable Individual Property except
those which are insured against by title insurance.

                  8.45 Leases. The Individual Properties are not subject to any
leases, licenses, or other possessory interests other than the Qualified Leases.
Borrower or the relevant Obligor is the owner and lessor of landlord's interest
in the Qualified Leases. No Person has any possessory interest in any Individual
Property or right to occupy the same except under and pursuant to the provisions
of the Qualified Leases. The Qualified Leases are in full force and effect and
there are no material defaults thereunder by either party and there are no
conditions that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both,
would constitute defaults thereunder. No Rent (including security deposits) has
been paid more than one (1) month in advance of its due date. All work to be
performed by Borrower under each Qualified Lease has been performed as required
and has been accepted by the applicable tenant, and any payments, free rent,
partial rent, rebate of rent or other payments, credits, allowances or
abatements required to be given by Borrower to any tenant has already been
received by such tenant. There has been no prior sale, transfer or assignment,
hypothecation or pledge of any Qualified Lease or of the Rents received therein.
No tenant under a Qualified Lease has assigned its Lease or sublet all or any
portion of the premises demised thereby, no tenant under a Qualified Lease or
such other tenant holds its leased premises under assignment or sublease, nor
does anyone except the related tenant under a Qualified Lease or such other
tenant and its employees occupy such leased premises. No tenant under any
Qualified Lease has a right or option pursuant to such lease or otherwise to
purchase all or any part of the leased premises or the building of which the
leased premises are a part. No tenant under any Qualified Lease has any right or
option for additional space in the Improvements. To the best knowledge of
Borrower, no hazardous wastes or toxic substances, as defined by applicable
federal, state or local statutes, rules and regulations, have been disposed,
stored or treated by any tenant under any Lease on or about the leased premises





                                       56

nor does Borrower have any knowledge of any tenant's intention to use its leased
premises for any activity which, directly or indirectly, involves the use,
generation, treatment, storage, disposal or transportation of any petroleum
product or any toxic or hazardous chemical, material, substance or waste.

                  8.46 Survey. The Survey for each Individual Property delivered

stamps, intangible taxes or other amounts in the nature of transfer taxes
required to be paid by any Person under applicable Legal Requirements currently
in effect in connection with the transfer of the Properties to Borrower have
been paid. All mortgage, mortgage recording, stamp, intangible or other similar
tax required to be paid by any Person under applicable Legal Requirements

filing, registration, perfection or enforcement of any of the Loan Documents,
including, without limitation, the Mortgages, been paid, and, under current
Legal Requirements, each of the Mortgages is enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms by Lender (or any subsequent holder thereof), subject to
principles of equity and bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other
laws generally applicable to creditors' rights and the enforcement of debtors'
obligations.

                  its assets; (3) engage in any other business activity, or
                  amend its organizational documents with respect to the matters
                  set forth in this definition without the consent of Lender; or
                  (4) without the affirmative vote of one (or two, if and when
                  required by Section 9.34 below) Independent Directors and of

                  not permit its assets to be listed as assets on the financial
                  statement of any other entity except as required by GAAP;
                  provided, however, that any such consolidated financial
                  statement shall contain a note indicating that its separate
                  assets and liabilities are neither available to pay the debts
                  of the consolidated entity nor constitute obligations of the
                  consolidated entity;

                           (xiv) has paid and will pay its own liabilities and

                                       59

                           (xxii) has held itself out and identified itself and

                  distinct entity under its own name;

                           (xxiii) has maintained and will maintain its assets
                  in such a manner that it will not be costly or difficult to

                  securities issued by an entity that is not an Affiliate of or

                  partners, members or shareholders, or any Affiliate of any of
                  them, as a division or part of it, and has not identified
                  itself and shall not identify itself as a division of any
                  other Person;

                           (xxvi) has not entered into or been a party to, and
                  will not enter into or be a party to, any transaction with its
                  shareholders or Affiliates except (A) in the ordinary course
                  of its business and on terms which are intrinsically fair,
                  commercially reasonable and are no less favorable to it than
                  would be obtained in a comparable arm's-length transaction
                  with an unrelated third party and (B) in connection with this
                  Agreement;

                           (xxvii) has not and will not have any obligation to,
                  and will not, indemnify its officers, directors or
                  shareholders, as the case may be, unless such an obligation is
                  fully subordinated to the Loan and will not constitute a claim
                  against it in the event that cash flow in excess of the amount
                  required to pay the Loan is insufficient to pay such
                  obligation;

                           (xxviii) shall consider the interests of its
                  creditors in connection with all corporate actions;

                           (xxix) does not and will not have its obligations
                  guaranteed by any Affiliate;

                           (xxx) has complied and will comply with all of the
                  terms and provisions contained in its organizational
                  documents. The statement of facts contained in its
                  organizational documents are true and correct and will remain
                  true and correct; and

                           (xxxi) has and shall maintain at least 1 Independent
                  Director and caused the articles of incorporation for such
                  Person to require at least 1 Independent Director.

                  (b) The representations, warranties and covenants set forth in
         Section 8.49 shall survive for so long as any amount remains payable to
         Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

<PAGE>

                  (c) All of the factual assumptions made in any insolvency
         opinion, including any exhibits attached thereto, are true and correct
         in all respects and any factual assumptions made in any subsequent
         non-consolidation opinion delivered in connection with the Loan
         Documents (an "Additional Insolvency Opinion"), including any exhibits
         attached thereto, will have been and shall be true and correct in all
         respects. Borrower has complied and will comply with all of the factual
         assumptions made with respect to it in the Insolvency Opinion. Borrower
         will have complied and will comply with all of the factual assumptions
         made with respect to it in any Additional Insolvency Opinion. Each
         entity other than Borrower with respect to which a factual assumption
         shall be made in any Additional Insolvency Opinion will have complied
         and will comply with all of the factual assumptions made with respect
         to it in any Additional Insolvency Opinion.

                  8.50 Management of Properties. With the exception of the
Westminster Retail Property once acquired, each Individual Property is
self-managed by the Obligor which owns it (or by a subsidiary of such Obligor)
in so far as each Individual Property is leased to a tenant which is required to
perform typical property management functions (other than collection of Rents
under Qualified Leases) pursuant to the related Qualified Lease and no third
party property manager has been retained with respect to any Individual
Property.

                  8.51 Ground Leases. Borrower covenants, represents and
warrants to Lender with respect to the Qualified Ground Leases, if any, as
follows:

                  (a) Except as previously disclosed to Lender, no default has
         occurred and is continuing under the terms of any Qualified Ground
         Lease, and no event has occurred that, with the passage of time or
         service of notice, or both, would constitute an event of default under
         any Qualified Ground Lease.

                  (b) Each Qualified Ground Lease is in full force and effect.

                  (c) All rents, additional rents, percentage rents and all
         other charges due and payable under each Qualified Ground Lease have
         been fully paid.

                  (d) Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, Megaplex Owner is
         the owner of the entire lessee's interest in and under each Qualified
         Ground Lease and has the right and authority under each Qualified
         Ground Lease to execute this Agreement, the related Mortgage and other
         related Loan Documents, and to encumber Megaplex Owner's interest in
         the Qualified Ground Leases.

                  (e) Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly and
         timely perform and observe, or cause Megaplex Owner or the applicable
         tenant under a Qualified Lease to promptly and timely perform and
         observe, all the material terms, covenants and conditions required to
         be performed and observed by Megaplex Owner as lessee under each
         Qualified Ground Lease (including the payment of all rent, additional
         rent, percentage rent and other charges required to be paid under such
         Qualified Ground Lease).

                  (f) If Borrower or Megaplex Owner shall violate any of the
         covenants specified above, then, subject to the applicable Qualified
         Ground Lease terms, Borrower



                                       61
<PAGE>

         and Megaplex Owner each grant Lender the right (but not the obligation)
         to cause the default or defaults under any Qualified Ground Lease to be
         remedied and otherwise exercise any and all rights of Borrower or
         Megaplex Owner under each Qualified Ground Lease, as may be necessary
         to prevent or cure any default, provided such actions are necessary to
         protect Lender's interest under this instrument, and Lender shall have
         the right subject to the terms of the Qualified Ground Lease to enter
         all or any portion of the Megaplex Property at such times and in such
         manner as Lender deems necessary, to prevent or to cure any such
         default.

                  (g) The actions or payments of Lender to cure any default by
         Borrower under any Qualified Ground Lease shall not remove or waive, as
         between any Obligor and Lender, the default that occurred under this
         Agreement by virtue of the default by Borrower or Megaplex Owner under
         any Qualified Ground Lease. All sums expended by Lender to cure any
         such default shall be paid by Borrower to Lender, upon demand, with
         interest on such sum at the rate set forth in the Note from the date
         such sum is expended to and including the date the reimbursement
         payment is made to the Lender. All such indebtedness shall be deemed to
         be secured by the Mortgages and other Loan Documents.

                  (h) Borrower shall notify Lender promptly in writing after any
         Obligor receives notice of the occurrence of any material default by
         the lessor under any Qualified Ground Lease or the occurrence of any
         event that, with the passage of time or service of notice, or both,
         would constitute a material default by the lessor under any Qualified
         Ground Lease, and the receipt by Borrower of any notice (written or
         otherwise) from the lessor under any Qualified Ground Lease noting or
         claiming the occurrence of any default by any Obligor under any
         Qualified Ground Lease or the occurrence of any event that, with the
         passage of time or service of notice, or both, would constitute a
         default by any Obligor under any Qualified Ground Lease. Borrower shall
         promptly deliver to Lender a copy of any such written notice of
         default.

                  (i) Within thirty (30) days after written demand by Lender,
         Borrower shall use reasonable efforts (other than payments to the
         lessor) to obtain from the lessor under any Qualified Ground Lease and
         furnish to Lender the estoppel certificate of such lessor stating the
         date through which rent has been paid and whether or not there are any
         defaults thereunder and specifying the nature of such claimed defaults,
         if any.

                  (j) Subject to the applicable Qualified Ground Lease terms,
         Borrower shall, and shall cause Megaplex Owner to, promptly execute,
         acknowledge and deliver to Lender such instruments as may reasonably be
         required to permit Lender to cure any default under any Qualified
         Ground Lease or permit Lender to take such other action required to
         enable Lender to cure or remedy the matter in default and preserve the
         security interest of Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to
         any Property which is the subject of a Qualified Ground Lease. Borrower
         and Megaplex Owner each irrevocably appoint Lender as its true and
         lawful attorney-in-fact to do, in its name or otherwise, any and all
         acts and to execute any and all documents that are necessary to
         preserve any rights of Borrower or Megaplex Owner under or with respect
         to the Qualified Ground Leases, including the right to effectuate any
         extension or renewal of any Qualified Ground Lease, or to preserve any
         rights of Borrower whatsoever in respect



                                       62
<PAGE>

         of any part of any Qualified Ground Lease (and the above powers granted
         to Lender are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable).

                  (k) The generality of the provisions of this section relating
         to the Qualified Ground Leases shall not be limited by other provisions
         of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents setting forth particular
         obligations of any Obligor that are also required of Borrower with
         respect to the Qualified Ground Leases or the related Properties
         subject to such Qualified Ground Lease.

                  (l) Borrower shall not, and shall not permit Megaplex Owner
         to, without Lender's prior written consent, surrender, terminate,
         forfeit, or suffer or permit the surrender, termination or forfeiture
         of, or change, modify or amend in a material or adverse manner, any
         Qualified Ground Lease. Consent to one amendment, change, agreement or
         modification shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to require
         consent to other, future or successive amendments, changes, agreements
         or modifications. Any acquisition of any lessor's interest in any
         Qualified Ground Lease by Borrower or any affiliate of Borrower shall
         be accomplished by Borrower in such a manner so as to avoid a merger of
         the interests of lessor and lessee in such Qualified Ground Lease,
         unless consent to such merger is granted by Lender.

                  (m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
         Agreement with respect to the Qualified Ground Leases:

                           (i) The lien of the related Mortgage attaches to all
                  of Megaplex Owner's rights and remedies at any time arising
                  under or pursuant to Subsection 365(h) of the Bankruptcy Code,
                  11 U.S.C. Sections 101 et seq. (the "Bankruptcy Code"),
                  including all of Megaplex Owner's rights, as debtor, to remain
                  in possession of the related Property subject to such
                  Qualified Ground Lease.

                           (ii) Neither Borrower nor Megaplex Owner shall,
                  without Lender's written consent, elect to treat any Qualified
                  Ground Lease as terminated under subsection 365(h)(1) of the
                  Bankruptcy Code. Any such election made without Lender's prior
                  written consent shall be void.

                           (iii) As security for the Loan, Borrower and Megaplex
                  Owner unconditionally assign, transfer and set over to Lender
                  all of Borrower's claims and rights to the payment of damages
                  arising from any rejection by the lessor under any Qualified
                  Ground Lease under the Bankruptcy Code. Lender and Borrower
                  and Megaplex Owner shall proceed jointly or in the name of
                  Borrower or Megaplex Owner in respect of any claim, suit,
                  action or proceeding relating to the rejection of any
                  Qualified Ground Lease, including the right to file and
                  prosecute any proofs of claim, complaints, motions,
                  applications, notices and other documents in any case in
                  respect of lessor under the Bankruptcy Code. This assignment
                  constitutes a present, irrevocable and unconditional
                  assignment of the foregoing claims, rights and remedies, and
                  shall continue in effect until all of the Loan and other
                  obligations of Borrower to Lender under the Loan Documents
                  shall have been satisfied and discharged in full. Any amounts
                  received by Lender



                                       63
<PAGE>

                  or Borrower or Megaplex Owner as damages arising out of the
                  rejection of any Qualified Ground Lease as aforesaid shall be
                  applied first to all costs and expenses of Lender (including
                  attorneys' fees and costs) incurred in connection with the
                  exercise of any of its rights or remedies under this Section
                  8.51(m) and then in accordance with the other applicable
                  provisions of this Agreement.

                           (iv) If, pursuant to subsection 365(h) of the
                  Bankruptcy Code, Borrower or Megaplex Owner seeks to offset,
                  against the rent reserved in any Qualified Ground Lease, the
                  amount of any damages caused by the nonperformance by the
                  lessor of any of its obligations thereunder after the
                  rejection by lessor of any Qualified Ground Lease under the
                  Bankruptcy Code, then Borrower or Megaplex Owner shall not
                  effect any offset of the amounts so objected to by Lender. If
                  Lender has failed to object as aforesaid within ten (10) days
                  after notice from Borrower or Megaplex Owner in accordance
                  with the first sentence of this subsection, Borrower or
                  Megaplex Owner may proceed to offset the amounts set forth in
                  such notice.

                           (v) If any action, proceeding, motion or notice shall
                  be commenced or filed in respect of any lessor of all or any
                  part of the leasehold property in connection with any case
                  under the Bankruptcy Code, Lender, Borrower and Megaplex Owner
                  shall cooperatively conduct and control any such litigation
                  with counsel agreed upon between Borrower, Lender and Megaplex
                  Owner in connection with such litigation. Borrower and
                  Megaplex Owner shall, upon demand, pay to Lender all costs and
                  expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs)
                  actually paid or actually incurred by Lender in connection
                  with the cooperative prosecution or conduct of any such
                  proceedings. All such costs and expenses shall be secured by
                  the lien of the Mortgages and other Loan Documents.

                           (vi) Borrower and Megaplex Owner shall promptly,
                  after obtaining knowledge of such filing notify Lender orally
                  of any filing by or against any lessor under a Qualified
                  Ground Lease of a petition under the Bankruptcy Code. Borrower
                  and Megaplex Owner shall thereafter promptly give written
                  notice of such filing to Lender, setting forth any information
                  available to Borrower and Megaplex Owner as to the date of
                  such filing, the court in which such petition was filed, and
                  the relief sought in such filing. Borrower shall promptly
                  deliver to Lender any and all notices, summonses, pleadings,
                  applications and other documents received by Borrower in
                  connection with any such petition and any proceedings relating
                  to such petition.

                  (n) In addition to those events otherwise set forth in this
         Agreement, the occurrence of any of the following events shall, at
         Lender's option, constitute an Event of Default, as such term is
         defined in Section 10 hereof and, upon the occurrence of an Event of
         Default, Lender shall have all of the rights and remedies available to
         it under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents:

                                       64
<PAGE>

                           (i) A breach or default by Borrower under any
                  condition or obligation contained in any Qualified Ground
                  Lease that is not cured within any applicable cure period
                  provided therein;

                           (ii) The occurrence of any event or condition that
                  gives the lessor under any Qualified Ground Lease a right to
                  terminate or cancel such Qualified Ground Lease unless cured
                  by Borrower or Megaplex Owner (in case of nonpayment by a
                  tenant under the applicable Qualified Lease); or

                           (iii) Borrower's or Megaplex Owner's failure to
                  permit Lender and/or its representatives at all reasonable
                  times upon reasonable prior written notice, but subject to the
                  applicable Qualified Ground Lease and Qualified Lease
                  respective terms, to make investigation or examination
                  concerning Borrower's or Megaplex Owner's performance and
                  observance of the terms, covenants and conditions of any
                  Qualified Ground Lease.

                  (o) Borrower shall not, without Lender's written consent, fail
         to exercise or cause Megaplex Owner to exercise any option or right to
         renew or extend the term of any Qualified Ground Lease at least six (6)
         months prior to the date of termination of any such option or right,
         and shall give immediate written notice to Lender and shall execute,
         acknowledge, deliver and record any document requested by Lender to
         evidence the lien of the applicable Mortgage on such extended or
         renewed lease term; provided, however, Borrower shall not be required
         to exercise any particular such option or right to renew or extend to
         the extent Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of
         Lender (which consent may be withheld by Lender in its sole and
         absolute discretion) allowing Borrower to forego exercising such option
         or right to renew or extend. If Borrower shall fail to exercise or
         cause Megaplex Owner to exercise any such option or right as aforesaid,
         Lender may exercise the option or right as Megaplex Owner's and
         Borrower's agent and attorney-in-fact as provided above in Lender's own
         name or in the name of and on behalf of a nominee of Lender, as Lender
         may determine in the exercise of its sole and absolute discretion.

                  (p) Upon the request of Lender, Borrower shall deposit with
         Lender a copy of each fully executed Qualified Ground Lease certified
         by Borrower as true and correct, as further security to Lender, until
         all of the obligations are fully paid and performed.

                  (q) Neither Borrower nor Megaplex Owner shall waive, excuse,
         condone or in any way release or discharge the lessor under any
         Qualified Ground Lease of or from such lessor's material obligations,
         covenant and/or conditions under such Qualified Ground Lease without
         the prior written consent of Lender.

                  (r) To the best of Borrower's knowledge, as of the Effective
         Date, there has been no event which would materially alter information
         contained in those ground lessor estoppels delivered by Borrower to
         Lender with respect to the Qualified Ground Leases prior to the date
         hereof.

                  8.52 Illegal Activity. No portion of any Individual Property
has been or will be purchased by Borrower or any of its Affiliates with proceeds
of any illegal activity.

                  8.53 No Change in Facts or Circumstances; Disclosure. All
information submitted by Borrower to Lender and to the best of knowledge of
Borrower, submitted on behalf of Borrower to Lender, including all financial
statements, rent rolls, reports, certificates and other documents submitted in
connection with the Loan or in satisfaction of the terms thereof and all
statements of fact made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any other Loan
Document, are accurate, complete and correct in all material respects. Lender
acknowledges Borrower has relied on Tenant Information, which Borrower
represents and warrants that Borrower has no knowledge that such Tenant
Information is incorrect. Except for the Loews Lease, there has been no material
adverse change in any condition, fact, circumstance or event that would make any
such information inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise misleading in any material
respect or that otherwise materially adversely affects or might materially
adversely affect the use, operation or value of any Individual Property or the
business operations or the financial condition of Borrower unless such change
has been fully disclosed in writing to Lender. Borrower has disclosed to Lender
all material facts and has not failed to disclose any material fact that could
cause any provided information or representation or warranty made herein to be
materially misleading.

                  8.54 Inventory. Borrower is the owner of all of the equipment
and assets at the Individual Properties or used in connection with the
Individual Properties, other than those owned by the tenant under a Qualified
Lease and Borrower shall not lease any equipment or assets other than as
permitted hereunder.

                  8.55 Survival of Representations. Borrower agrees that all of
the representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in this Agreement and
in the other Loan Documents shall survive for so long as any amount remains
owing to Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents by
Borrower. All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made in this
Agreement or in the other Loan Documents by Borrower shall be deemed to have
been relied upon by Lender notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or
hereafter made by Lender or on its behalf.

         Section 9. Covenants of Borrower. Borrower covenants and agrees with
Lender that, so long as the Loan is outstanding and until payment in full of all
amounts payable by Borrower hereunder:

                  9.01 Financial Statements and Other Information. Borrower
shall deliver to Lender:

         the end of each fiscal year of Borrower, consolidated and consolidating

         consolidating balance sheets of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at the
         end of such fiscal year, setting forth in each case in comparative form
         the corresponding consolidated and consolidating figures for the
         preceding fiscal year, and accompanied (i) in the case of such

         accountants of recognized national standing, which opinion shall state
         that such consolidated financial statements fairly present the
         consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Borrower
         and its Subsidiaries as at the end of, and for, such fiscal year in
         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and a
         statement of such accountants to the effect that, in making the
         examination necessary for their opinion, nothing came to their
         attention that caused them to believe that Borrower was not in
         compliance with Section 9.11, insofar as such Section relates to
         accounting matters, and (ii) in the case of such consolidating
         statements and balance sheets, by a certificate of a Financial Officer
         of Borrower, which certificate shall state that such consolidating

         principles consistently applied.

                  (c) as soon as available and in any event within 45 days after
         the end of each quarterly fiscal period of each fiscal year of
         Borrower, unaudited consolidated and consolidating statements of
         income, retained earnings and cash flows of Borrower and its

         prior fiscal year), accompanied by a certificate of a Financial Officer
         of Borrower or other Obligor, as applicable, which certificate shall
         state that such consolidated financial statements fairly present the
         consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the
         respective Person(s), and such consolidating financial statements
         fairly present the respective individual unconsolidated financial
         condition and results of operations of Borrower and its Subsidiaries
         and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, in each case in accordance with
         generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, as at
         the end of, and for, such period (subject to normal year-end audit
         adjustments);

         (subject to normal year-end adjustments) as applicable: a rent
         collection report and reports on theater ticket and other sales for the
         calculation of percentage rents under the Qualified Leases to the

         each such month accompanied by an Officer's Certificate with respect
         thereto. In addition, such certificate shall also be accompanied by a
         certificate of Financial Officer of Borrower stating that the
         representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in Section 8.49
         are true and correct as of the date of such certificate and that there

                  (i) promptly upon the mailing thereof to the shareholders of
         Borrower generally, copies of all financial statements, reports and
         proxy statements so mailed;

                  (j) contemporaneously with (or promptly after) the filing or
         mailing thereof, copies of all material of a financial nature sent to
         the holders of any Indebtedness of Borrower or any Subsidiary of
         Borrower (other than the Loan) for borrowed money, to the extent that
         the information or disclosure contained in such material refers to or
         could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (k) from time to time such other information regarding the
         financial condition, operations, business or prospects of Borrower, any
         of its Subsidiaries, including any Obligor, the Real Estate Properties
         and any unconsolidated subordinary or minority in interests (including
         any Plan or Multiemployer Plan and any reports or other information
         required to be filed under ERISA), or compliance with the terms of this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as Lender may reasonably
         request; provided, however, Borrower's obligation to deliver any
         information with respect to a lessee of any Real Estate Property shall
         be limited to the information which Borrower or any other Obligor
         actually has in its possession; and

                  (l) Promptly after receipt, or giving, as applicable, of each
         notice, demand, request, certificate, report, financial statement or
         other material correspondence given to, or received by, Borrower or any
         of its subsidiaries, from any tenant or any Lender or any ground
         lessors.

                  (m) Throughout the term of the Loan and until the Loan and all
         obligations of Borrower to Lender have been paid in full, Borrower
         shall operate and cause Megaplex Owner and all of its direct and
         indirect subsidiaries to operate in accordance with an annual budget
         which has been approved by Borrower and delivered to Lender (each, an
         "APPROVED ANNUAL BUDGET"), except as permitted by subsection (n) below.
         The Approved Annual Budget shall be revised (only with Lender's
         approval) to include any new acquisitions by Megaplex Owner or its
         Subsidiaries. For the partial year commencing on the date hereof, the
         Approved Annual Budget is attached hereto as Exhibit I. For each
         calendar year thereafter, Borrower shall deliver to Lender the Annual
         Budget not later than sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of such
         calendar year in form reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Until such
         time as a new Approved Annual Budget is delivered to Lender, the most
         recently Approved Annual Budget delivered to Lender shall apply.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, at such times and from time to time
         while an Event of Default exists, (i) Lender shall have the right to
         approve the then applicable Approved Annual Budget, and (ii) any
         portion of the then applicable Approved Annual Budget disapproved by
         Lender shall not be deemed a part of the Approved Annual Budget. Lender
         shall give Borrower notice of any such disapproval.

                  (n) In the event that, Borrower or Megaplex Owner must incur
         an extraordinary operating expense or capital expense not set forth in
         the Approved Annual Budget (each an "EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSE"), then
         Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender a reasonably detailed
         explanation of such Extraordinary Expense; provided that if such
         Extraordinary Expense occurs during the occurrence of an Event of
         Default such



                                       69
<PAGE>

         Extraordinary Expense must be approved in writing by Lender prior to
         being paid or incurred.

                  (o) If requested by Lender, Borrower shall provide Lender,
         promptly upon request, with any other or additional financial
         statements, or financial, statistical or operating information, as
         shall be reasonably requested by the Lender (to the extent any such
         information regarding the operation of any Individual Property by a
         tenant under a Qualified Lease is available to Borrower).

                  (p) Any reports, statements or other information required to
         be delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered (i) in paper form,
         (ii) on a diskette, and (iii) if requested by Lender and within the
         capabilities of Borrower's data systems without change or modification
         thereto, in electronic form and prepared using a Microsoft Word for
         Windows or WordPerfect for Windows files (which files may be prepared
         using a spreadsheet program and saved as word processing files).
         Obligors agree that Lender may disclose information regarding the
         Individual Properties and such Obligor that is provided to Lender
         pursuant to this Section in connection with the Securitization to such
         parties requesting such information in connection with such
         Securitization.

                  (q) Notwithstanding the foregoing, provisions of Sections
         9.01(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) shall be suspended and waived by Lender
         for so long as and to the extent Borrower is a reporting company under
         the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and copies of
         Borrower's form 10-K, 10-Q and annual reports are delivered to Lender
         promptly (and in any event within 10 business days) following their
         filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                  9.02 Existence; Compliance with Legal Requirements; Insurance.
Borrower shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew
and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights, licenses, permits and
franchises and comply, or cause applicable tenants to comply, with all Legal
Requirements applicable to it and the Individual Properties. There shall never
be committed by Borrower (or any other Obligor) and, if known to Borrower,
Borrower shall not suffer or permit to be committed by any other Person in
occupancy of or involved with the operation or use of any of the Individual
Properties, any act or omission affording the federal government or any state or
local government the right of forfeiture as against any Individual Property or
any part thereof or any monies paid in performance of Borrower's obligations
under any of the Loan Documents. Borrower hereby covenants and agrees not to
commit, permit or suffer to exist any act or omission affording such right of
forfeiture. Obligors shall at all times maintain, preserve and protect all
franchises and trade names and preserve all the remainder of its property used
or useful in the conduct of its business and shall, or shall cause the tenants
under Qualified Leases to, keep the Individual Properties in good working order
and repair, and from time to time make, or cause to be made, all reasonably
necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereto,
subject to the terms of any applicable Qualified Lease, all as more fully
provided in any applicable mortgage. Borrower shall, or shall cause the
applicable tenant under Qualified Leases to, keep each Individual Property
insured at all times by financially sound and reputable insurers, to such extent
and against such risks, and Borrower shall, or shall cause the applicable tenant
under a Qualified Lease to, maintain liability and such other insurance, as is
more fully provided in this



                                       70
<PAGE>

Agreement. After prior written notice to Lender and subject to the terms of a
Qualified Lease (other than and specifically excluding the Loews Lease),
Borrower or the tenant under a Qualified Lease, at its own expense, may contest
by appropriate legal proceeding promptly initiated and conducted in good faith
and with due diligence, the validity of any Legal Requirement, the applicability
of any Legal Requirement to Borrower, the applicable tenant under a Qualified
Lease or any Individual Property or any alleged violation of any Legal
Requirement, provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
remains uncured; (ii) such contest is permitted under the provisions of any
mortgage or deed of trust applicable thereto; (iii) such proceeding shall be
permitted under and be conducted in accordance with the provisions of any
instrument to which Borrower or any Obligor is subject and shall not constitute
a default thereunder and such proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with
all applicable statutes, laws and ordinances; (iv) no Individual Property nor
any part thereof or interest therein will be in danger of being sold, forfeited,
terminated, cancelled or lost; (v) promptly upon final determination thereof,
Borrower shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor or tenant
under a Qualified Lease to, comply with any such Legal Requirement determined to
be valid or applicable or cure any violation of any Legal Requirement; (vi) such
proceeding shall suspend the enforcement of the contested Legal Requirement
against Borrower, the Subsidiary Guarantor, the applicable tenant, and any
Individual Property, as applicable; and (vii) Borrower shall furnish, or shall
cause the applicable tenant under a Qualified Lease to furnish, such security as
may be required in the proceeding, or as may be requested by Lender, to ensure
compliance with such Legal Requirement, together with all interest and penalties
payable in connection therewith. Lender may apply any such security, as
necessary to cause compliance with such Legal Requirement at any time when, in
the reasonable judgment of Lender, the validity, applicability or violation of
such Legal Requirement is finally established or any Individual Property (or any
part thereof or interest therein) shall be in danger of being sold, forfeited,
terminated, cancelled or lost.

                  9.03 Notices of Material Events. Borrower will furnish the
following to Lender in writing:

                  (a) promptly after Borrower knows or has reason to believe
         that any Default has occurred, notice of such Default;

         or the Individual Properties, except proceedings that, if adversely
         determined, would not (either individually or in the aggregate) have a
         Material Adverse Effect;

                  (c) as soon as possible, and in any event within ten days

                  (e) prompt notice of any default under any Qualified Lease or

         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries within 15 days after such
         acquisition; and, at Lender's request, Borrower shall deliver to
         Lender, with respect to such Real Estate Property, a brief description
         and recent photograph, a rent roll summary, a pro forma and historic
         (if available) income statement and a summary of the key business terms

                  (a) Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to:

                  of its material rights, privileges, licenses and franchises
                  (provided that nothing in this Section 9.04 shall prohibit any
                  transaction expressly permitted under Section 9.06);

                           (ii) comply with the requirements of all applicable
                  laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental
                  Authority or regulatory authorities if failure to comply with
                  such requirements could (either individually or in the
                  aggregate) have a Material Adverse Effect;

                           (iii) subject to the applicable Qualified Lease
                  (other than and specifically excluding the Loews Lease), pay

                  tenant, all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or
                  levies imposed on it or on its income or profits or on any of
                  its Property prior to the date on which interest or penalties
                  attach thereto, except for any such tax, assessment, charge or
                  levy the payment of which is being contested in good faith and
                  by proper proceedings and against which adequate reserves are
                  being maintained; provided that Borrower shall pay, or cause
                  the tenant under a Qualified Lease to pay, all such taxes,
                  assessments, charges and levies being



                                       72

                           (v) keep adequate records and books of account, in
                  which complete entries will be made in accordance with
                  generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied;
                  and

                           (vi) subject to the terms of any applicable Qualified
                  Lease, permit representatives of Lender, during normal

                  books and records, to inspect any of the Individual
                  Properties, and to discuss its business and affairs with its

                  (b) Borrower shall give Lender notice in the event it does not
         maintain its status as a REIT or takes any action which could lead to
         its disqualification as a REIT.

         exchanges, including NASDAQ.

                  9.05 Insurance.

                  (a) Without limitation of the provisions of Section 9.05(b),
         Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain
         insurance with insurance companies rated A- or better, with respect to
         risks of a character usually maintained by corporations engaged in the
         same or similar business similarly situated, against loss, damage and
         liability of the kinds and in the amounts customarily maintained by
         such corporations. Borrower shall, prior to the expiration of any
         insurance required hereunder, deliver to the Lender evidence of
         insurance evidencing the existence of all such insurance, such
         certificates to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
         Lender, it being agreed that such insurance and certificates may be
         maintained by the tenant under its applicable Qualified Lease.

                  (b) Borrower shall obtain and maintain, or cause to be
         maintained, insurance for Borrower and the Individual Owned Properties
         providing at least the following coverages:

                           (i) property insurance for each Individual Property,
                  will be maintained by the tenant under each Qualified Lease,
                  at Tenant's sole cost and expense, for the mutual benefit of
                  such tenant, Borrower and Lender. The requirements as
                  specified in the Qualified Leases will be the required
                  coverage under this Agreement for the property to which such
                  Qualified Lease relates. Borrower and Lender agree that the
                  coverage in place as of the Original Effective Date for
                  Qualified Leases on the Megaplex Properties are acceptable to
                  Lender and meet the requirements of this Agreement.

         expiration dates of the Policies theretofore furnished to Lender,
         Borrower shall cause certificates of insurance evidencing the Policies
         specified in Section 9.05(b) accompanied by evidence satisfactory to
         Lender of payment of the premiums due thereunder (the "Insurance
         Premiums"), to be delivered by Borrower to Lender.

                  (d) Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate
         to the Individual Property the amount of coverage from time to time
         required hereunder and shall otherwise provide the same protection as
         would a separate Policy insuring only the Properties in compliance with
         the provisions of Section 9.05(b).

                  (e) All Policies provided for in Section 9.05(b) shall contain
         clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

                           (i) no act or negligence of any Obligor, or anyone
                  acting for Obligor, or of any tenant or occupant, or failure
                  to comply with the provisions of any Policy, which might
                  otherwise result in a forfeiture of the insurance or any part
                  thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or
                  enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is
                  concerned;

                           (ii) the Policy shall not be materially changed
                  (other than to increase the coverage provided thereby) or
                  canceled without at least thirty (30) days' written notice to
                  Lender and any other party named therein as an additional
                  insured;

                           (iii) the issuers thereof shall give written notice
                  to Lender if the Policy has not been renewed thirty (30) days
                  prior to its expiration; and

                           (iv) Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance
                  Premiums thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

                  (f) If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written
         evidence that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and
         effect, Lender shall have the right, without notice to any Obligor, to
         take such action as Lender deems necessary to protect its interest in
         the Individual Properties, including the obtaining of such insurance
         coverage as Lender in its sole discretion deems appropriate. All
         premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such action or in
         obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
         Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the
         Mortgages and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

                  9.06 Prohibition of Fundamental Changes.

                  (a) Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary
         Guarantor or the Securitization Property Owner to, enter into any
         transaction of merger or consolidation or amalgamation, or liquidate,

                  Subsidiary Guarantor or Securitized Property Owner) may be
                  merged or consolidated with or into: (i) Borrower if Borrower
                  shall be the continuing or surviving entity or (ii) any other
                  such Subsidiary; provided that if any such transaction shall
                  be between a Subsidiary and a Wholly Owned Subsidiary, the
                  Wholly Owned Subsidiary shall be the continuing or surviving
                  entity;

                           (ii) any Subsidiary (other than any Subsidiary
                  Guarantor or Securitized Property Owner) of Borrower may sell,
                  lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all of its
                  Property (upon voluntary liquidation or otherwise) to
                  Borrower; and

                           (iii) Borrower may merge or consolidate with any
                  other Person in connection with the acquisition of Real Estate
                  Properties if (i) Borrower is the surviving entity and, (ii)
                  after giving effect thereto no Default would exist hereunder,
                  provided that prior to such merger or consolidation, Borrower
                  shall provide to Lender a certificate signed by a Financial
                  Officer setting forth in reasonable detail computations
                  evidencing compliance with the covenants contained in Sections
                  9.07, 9.08, 9.09, 9.10 and 9.11 and certifying that no Default
                  has occurred and is continuing, or would occur and be
                  continuing after giving effect to such merger or consolidation
                  and all liabilities, fixed or contingent, pursuant thereto.

                  (b) Borrower will not, nor will it permit any of its
         Subsidiary Guarantors or Securitization Property Owner to, dispose of
         any Real Estate Properties in any single transaction having a sales
         price (net of any Indebtedness secured by a Lien on such Real Estate
         Properties, if any) in excess of $50,000,000 or grant a Lien to secure
         Indebtedness in any single transaction in an amount in excess of
         $25,000,000 (except as permitted in Section 7.03) unless, in each such
         event, Borrower has provided to the Lender a certificate signed by a
         Financial Officer setting forth in reasonable detail computations
         evidencing compliance with the covenants contained in Sections 9.07,
         9.08, 9.09, 9.10, and 9.11, and certifying that no Default has occurred
         and is continuing, or would occur and be continuing after giving effect
         to such proposed sale or Lien, taking into account any Loan to be
         prepaid from the proceeds of such transaction. Furthermore, Borrower
         will not permit Obligors to dispose or permit the disposition of all or
         any part of the Individual Properties, or any direct or indirect
         interest therein provided, however, (a) a Megaplex Property may be
         replaced pursuant to Section 9.35, and (b) a Pad Property may be sold
         pursuant to Section 2.10.

                  unless the amount thereof is not material with

                  contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and

                  encumbrances listed in title reports approved by Lender that,
                  in the aggregate, are not material in amount, and that do not
                  in any case materially detract from the value of the
                  Individual Property subject thereto or interfere with the
                  ordinary conduct of the business of Borrower or any of its
                  Subsidiaries;

                           (vi) Qualified Leases permitted under the terms of

acquire Individual Properties, Borrower shall (subject to the provisions of
Section 7.03) cause Lender to obtain a Lien in its favor on such Individual
Properties or upon equity or debt instruments pertaining to the Persons in which
an Investment is made. Lender will, in connection therewith, obtain all
mortgages, pledges, consents, estoppels, subordination agreements and other
information and rights as Lender currently has, or is permitted to have, on
comparable Property in connection with the Loan and security therefor, all
provided by, or at the expense of, Borrower.

         shall be necessary to ensure that each of its Subsidiaries remains a
         Subsidiary.

                  (b) Certain Restrictions. Borrower will not permit Megaplex
         Owner or any of Megaplex Owner's Subsidiaries to enter into, after the
         date hereof, any indenture, agreement, instrument or other arrangement
         that, directly or indirectly, prohibits or restrains, or has the effect
         of prohibiting or restraining, or imposes materially adverse conditions
         upon, the incurrence or payment of Indebtedness, the granting of Liens,
         the declaration or payment of dividends, the making of loans, advances
         or Investments or the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition
         of Property.

modification, supplement or waiver of any of the provisions of (a) any Loan
Document; (b) such Person's declaration of trust, by-laws or



                                       80

other charter documents if, in the case of this clause (b) such changes would
materially and adversely affect any of the rights of Lender under any Loan
Document, or (c) the documents evidencing or securing Indebtedness evidenced by
the Megaplex Nine Loan Documents or Archon Securitized Loan Documents, without,
in the case of any of clause (a), (b) or (c), the prior consent of Lender.

                  9.19 Further Assurances. Borrower shall, and shall cause each
Obligor to, cooperate with Lender and will execute any and all further
documents, agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions which
may be required under any applicable law, or which Lender may reasonably
request, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

                  9.20 Environmental Compliance.

                  (a) Borrower covenants and agrees that (i) the uses and
         operations on or of the Real Estate Properties, shall be in material
         compliance with all Environmental Laws and permits issued pursuant
         thereto, (ii) it shall use diligent efforts to enforce the provisions
         of each Qualified Lease relative to compliance with all applicable
         Environmental Laws and permits and (iii) in the event that any
         Hazardous Materials are present on, under or emanate from the Real
         Estate Properties, or migrate onto or into the Real Estate Properties,
         Borrower shall, if required by any Governmental Authority, cause (or
         use diligent efforts to cause the lessee under any Qualified Lease to
         cause) the Remediation of such Hazardous Materials, in accordance with
         applicable Environmental Laws.

                  (b) If Lender has reasonable grounds to believe that an
         Environmental Defect has occurred with respect to any one or more of
         the Individual Properties which would cost in excess of $1,000,000 to
         remediate, whether or not a Default shall have occurred, Lender may,
         from time to time, for the purpose of assessing and determining whether
         an Environmental Defect has in fact occurred, cause Borrower to obtain

         Property prepared by a hydrogeologist, an independent engineer or other

         preceding such scheduled due date.

         anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the other Loan
         Documents, and provided no Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, Borrower's obligations with respect to the monthly payment
         of principal and interest and any amounts due for the Reserve Funds
         shall be deemed satisfied to the extent sufficient amounts are
         deposited in the Lockbox Account to satisfy such obligations and any
         other obligations due on the dates each such payment is required,
         regardless of whether any of such amounts are so applied by Lender.

                  (d) Following an Event of Default, in addition to any other
         right or remedy Lender may have under the Loan Documents, Lender shall
         have the option, acting in its sole and absolute discretion, to apply

         occurrence of a Cash Trap Termination Event under the Cash Management
         Agreement promptly once Lender has knowledge such event has occurred,
         and (ii) at such time as Lender has knowledge that the Megaplex Debt
         Service Coverage Ratio equals or exceeds the Cash Trap MDSCR for each
         month, measured month by month, for six (6) consecutive months, Lender
         shall advise Agent and Borrower and permit the Cash Trap Account to be
         disbursed to Borrower pursuant to the Cash Management Agreement
         (subject to Section 7.04(d)).

Individual Properties or any part thereof as the same become due and payable;

applicable tenant to directly pay, Taxes with respect to an Individual Property
shall be suspended for so long as such Taxes are paid from the Tax and Insurance
Escrow Fund and Borrower complies with the terms and provisions of Section 9.30

the date the same shall become delinquent (provided, however, that Borrower is
not required to furnish such receipts for payment of Taxes in the event that
such Taxes have been paid by Lender pursuant to Section 9.30 hereof). Borrower
shall not suffer and shall promptly cause to be paid by the tenant under a
Qualified Lease for such property and discharged any Lien or charge whatsoever
which may be or become a Lien or charge against the Individual Properties, and
shall promptly pay, or cause the applicable tenant under a Qualified Lease to
pay, for all utility services provided to the Individual Properties. After prior
written notice to Lender, Borrower or the applicable tenant under a Qualified
Lease, at its own expense, may contest by appropriate legal proceeding, promptly
initiated and conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the amount or
validity or application in whole or in part of any Taxes or Other Charges,

part thereof or interest therein will be in danger of being sold, forfeited,
terminated, cancelled or lost; (v) Borrower or the applicable tenant under a

of any such Taxes or Other Charges, together with all costs, interest and
penalties which may be payable in connection therewith; (vi) such proceeding
shall suspend the collection of such contested Taxes or Other Charges from the
applicable Individual Property; and (vii) Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause
the applicable tenant under a Qualified Lease to furnish, such security as may
be required in the proceeding, or as may be requested by Lender but subject to
the terms of any Qualified Lease applicable thereto, to insure the payment of
any such Taxes or Other Charges, together with all interest and penalties
thereon. Lender may pay over any such cash deposit or part thereof held by
Lender to the claimant entitled thereto at any time when, in the judgment of
Lender, the entitlement of such claimant is established or any Individual
Property (or part thereof or interest therein) shall be in danger of being sold,
forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost or there shall be any danger of the
Lien of any Mortgage being primed by any related Lien.

                  9.26 Access to Individual Properties. Borrower shall permit
(or cause the requisite permission to be obtained to permit) agents,
representatives and employees of Lender to inspect the Individual Properties or
any part thereof at reasonable hours upon reasonable advance notice and subject

         and instrument required to be furnished by Borrower pursuant to the
         terms of the Loan Documents or reasonably requested by Lender in
         connection therewith;

                  (b) execute and deliver (or cause execution and delivery by
         other Obligors) to Lender such documents, instruments, certificates,
         assignments and other writings, and do such other acts necessary or
         desirable, to evidence, preserve and/or protect the collateral



                                       85
<PAGE>

         at any time securing or intended to secure the obligations of Borrower
         under the Loan Documents, as Lender may reasonably require; and

                  (c) do and execute (or cause other Obligors to do and execute)
         all and such further lawful and reasonable acts, conveyances and
         assurances for the better and more effective carrying out of the
         intents and purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as
         Lender shall reasonably require from time to time.

Condemnation of any Individual Property and shall deliver to Lender copies of
any and all papers served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may

deliver to Lender all instruments requested by it to permit such participation.
Borrower shall, at its expense, or shall cause tenant under a Qualified Lease,
to the extent applicable, to, diligently prosecute any such proceedings and
shall consult with Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in
the carrying on or defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking
by any public or quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise
(including any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Loan and all other obligations
of Borrower to Lender under the Loan Documents at the time and in the manner
provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Loan and all
other obligations of Borrower to Lender under the Loan Documents shall not be
reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and applied by Lender,
after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the reduction or discharge of
the Loan and all other obligations of Borrower to Lender under the Loan
Documents. Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the Award by the
condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the Award interest
at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note. If any Individual Property
or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority, Borrower shall
promptly commence and diligently prosecute, or shall cause the applicable tenant
under a Qualified Lease, to the extent applicable, to promptly commence and
diligently prosecute, the Restoration of the applicable Individual Property and
otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 9.29. Subject to Section 9.29(e)

recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a portion thereof sufficient to
pay the Loan and all other obligations of Borrower to Lender under the Loan
Documents.

         Restoration shall be less than One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars
         ($100,000), the Net Proceeds will be disbursed by Lender to Borrower

         9.29 are met and Borrower delivers to Lender a written undertaking to
         expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily complete with due
         diligence, or cause the



                                       86
<PAGE>

         tenant under a Qualified Lease, to the extent applicable, to
         expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily complete with due
         diligence, the Restoration in accordance with the terms of this
         Agreement and the Qualified Lease.

         amount of the Award, after deduction of its reasonable costs and
         expenses (including reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
         same ("CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS"), whichever the case may be.

                           (i) The Net Proceeds shall be made available to
                  Borrower for Restoration provided that each of the following

                                    or (2) in the event the Net Proceeds are
                                    Condemnation Proceeds, less than ten percent
                                    (10%) of the land constituting the

                                    the completion of the Restoration,
                                    notwithstanding the occurrence of any such
                                    fire or other casualty or taking, whichever
                                    the case may be;

                           (D)      Borrower shall commence, or shall cause the

                                    Restoration as soon as reasonably
                                    practicable (but in no event later than
                                    sixty (60) days after such damage or
                                    destruction or taking, whichever the case
                                    may be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue,
                                    or shall cause the tenant under a Qualified
                                    Lease, to the extent applicable, to pursue,
                                    the same to satisfactory completion;

                           (E)      Lender shall be satisfied that any operating
                                    deficits, including all scheduled payments
                                    of principal and interest under the Note,
                                    which will be incurred with respect to the
                                    Individual Property as a result

                                    casualty or taking, whichever the case may
                                    be, will be covered out of (1) the Net
                                    Proceeds, (2) the insurance coverage
                                    referred to in Section 9.05(b)(ii), if
                                    applicable, or (3) by other funds of
                                    Borrower;

                           (F)      Lender shall be satisfied that the
                                    Restoration will be completed on or before
                                    the earliest to occur of (1) six (6) months
                                    prior to the Maturity Date, (2) the earliest
                                    date required for such completion under the
                                    terms of any Qualified Leases, (3) such time
                                    as may be required under applicable zoning
                                    law, ordinance, rule or regulation in order
                                    to repair and restore the applicable
                                    Individual Property to the condition it was
                                    in immediately prior to such fire or other
                                    casualty or to as nearly as possible the
                                    condition it was in immediately prior to
                                    such taking, as applicable or (4) the
                                    expiration of the insurance coverage
                                    referred to in Section 9.05(b);

                           (G)      the Individual Property and the use thereof
                                    after the Restoration will be in compliance
                                    with and permitted under all applicable
                                    zoning laws, ordinances, rules and
                                    regulations;

                           (H)      the Restoration shall be done and completed
                                    by Borrower or the tenant under a Qualified
                                    Lease, to the extent applicable, in an
                                    expeditious and diligent fashion and in
                                    compliance with all applicable governmental
                                    laws, rules and regulations (including all
                                    applicable environmental laws);

                           (I)      such fire or other casualty or taking, as
                                    applicable, does not result in the loss of
                                    access to the Individual Property or the
                                    related Improvements;

                           (J)      Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be
                                    delivered, to Lender a signed detailed
                                    budget approved in writing by Borrower's or
                                    a Qualified Lease tenant's architect or
                                    engineer stating the entire cost of
                                    completing the Restoration, which budget
                                    shall be acceptable to Lender; and

                           (K)      the Net Proceeds together with any cash or
                                    cash equivalent deposited by Borrower or the
                                    tenant under a Qualified Lease, to the
                                    extent applicable, with Lender are
                                    sufficient in Lender's discretion to cover
                                    the cost of the Restoration.

                           (ii) The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender in an
                  interest-bearing Eligible Account and, until disbursed in
                  accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.29(b), shall
                  constitute additional security for the Loan and other
                  obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall
                  be disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower from
                  time to time during the course of the Restoration, upon
                  receipt of evidence satisfactory to Lender that (A) all
                  materials



                                       88
<PAGE>

                  installed and work and labor performed (except to the extent
                  that they are to be paid for out of the requested
                  disbursement) in connection with the Restoration have been
                  paid for in full, and (B) there exist no notices of pendency,
                  stop orders, mechanic's or materialman's liens or notices of
                  intention to file same, or any other liens or encumbrances of
                  any nature whatsoever on the Individual Property which have
                  not either been fully bonded to the satisfaction of Lender and
                  discharged of record or in the alternative fully insured to
                  the satisfaction of Lender by the title company issuing the
                  Title Insurance Policy.

                           (iii) All plans and specifications required in
                  connection with the Restoration shall be subject to prior
                  review and acceptance in all respects by Lender and by an
                  independent consulting engineer selected by Lender (the
                  "CASUALTY CONSULTANT"). Lender shall have the use of the plans
                  and specifications and all permits, licenses and approvals
                  required or obtained in connection with the Restoration. The
                  identity of the contractors, subcontractors and materialmen
                  engaged in the Restoration, as well as the contracts under
                  which they have been engaged, shall be subject to prior review
                  and acceptance by Lender and the Casualty Consultant. All
                  costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with
                  making the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration
                  including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements and the
                  Casualty Consultant's fees, shall be paid by Borrower.

                           (iv) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make
                  disbursements of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal
                  to the costs actually incurred from time to time for work in
                  place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the Casualty
                  Consultant, minus the Casualty Retainage. The term "Casualty
                  Retainage" shall mean an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of
                  the costs actually incurred for work in place as part of the
                  Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, until
                  the Restoration has been completed. The Casualty Retainage
                  shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything to the
                  contrary set forth above in this Section 9.29(b), be less than
                  the amount actually held back by Borrower or the tenant under
                  a Qualified Lease, to the extent applicable, from contractors,
                  subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The
                  Casualty Retainage shall not be released until the Casualty
                  Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
                  completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section
                  9.29(b) and that all approvals necessary for the re-occupancy
                  and use of the Individual Property have been obtained from all
                  appropriate governmental and quasi-governmental authorities,
                  and Lender receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the
                  costs of the Restoration have been paid in full or will be
                  paid in full out of the Casualty Retainage; provided, however,
                  that Lender will release the portion of the Casualty Retainage
                  being held with respect to any contractor, subcontractor or
                  materialman engaged in the Restoration as of the date upon
                  which the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the
                  contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily
                  completed all work and has supplied all materials in
                  accordance with the provisions of the contractor's,
                  subcontractor's or materialman's contract, the contractor,
                  subcontractor or materialman delivers the lien waivers and
                  evidence of payment in full of all sums



                                       89
<PAGE>

                  due to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be
                  reasonably requested by Lender or by the title company issuing
                  the Title Insurance Policy, and Lender receives an endorsement
                  to its Title Insurance Policy insuring the continued priority
                  of the lien of the related Mortgage and evidence of payment of
                  any premium payable for such endorsement. If required by
                  Lender, the release of any such portion of the Casualty
                  Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if any,
                  which has issued a payment or performance bond with respect to
                  the contractor, subcontractor or materialman.

                           (v) Lender shall not be obligated to make
                  disbursements of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once
                  every calendar month or in the amount less than Ten Thousand
                  Dollars ($10,000) (or a lesser amount if the total remaining
                  Net Proceeds are less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000), in
                  which case only one disbursement of the remaining Net Proceeds
                  shall be made).

                           (vi) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the
                  undisbursed balance thereof shall not, in the opinion of
                  Lender in consultation with the Casualty Consultant, be
                  sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are
                  estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be incurred in
                  connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower
                  shall deposit the deficiency (the "NET PROCEEDS DEFICIENCY")
                  with Lender before any further disbursement of the Net
                  Proceeds shall be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited
                  with Lender shall be held by Lender and shall be disbursed for
                  costs actually incurred in connection with the Restoration on
                  the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net
                  Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant to this Section
                  9.29(b) shall constitute additional security for the Loan and
                  other obligations under the Loan Documents.

                           (vii) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the
                  remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency
                  deposited with Lender after the Casualty Consultant certifies
                  to Lender that the Restoration has been completed in
                  accordance with the provisions of this Section 9329(b), and
                  the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that
                  all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration have
                  been paid in full, shall be deposited by Lender in the Lockbox
                  Account to be applied in accordance with the priorities set
                  forth therein, provided no Event of Default shall have
                  occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this
                  Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

                  (c) All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for
         the Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net
         Proceeds pursuant to Section 9.29(b)(vii) will be retained and applied
         by Lender toward the payment of the Loan and all other amounts owed by
         Borrower to Lender under the Loan Documents whether or not then due and
         payable in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its sole
         discretion shall deem proper, or, at the discretion of Lender, the same
         may be paid, either in whole or in part, to Borrower for such purposes
         as Lender shall approve, in its discretion.

                  (d) In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage with respect
         to the Individual Property, or other transfer of title to the
         Individual Property in extinguishment in whole



                                       90
<PAGE>

         or in part of the Loan all right, title and interest of Borrower in and
         to the Policies that are not blanket Policies then in force concerning
         the Individual Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall
         thereupon vest in the purchaser at such foreclosure or Lender or other
         transferee in the event of such other transfer of title.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
         Section 9.29, Lender and Borrower agree that, at all times while the
         Qualified Lease is in full force and effect with respect to an
         Individual Property, if (i) neither the applicable tenant thereunder
         nor Borrower shall elect to terminate the related Qualified Lease and
         (ii) the applicable tenant shall elect to restore such Individual
         Property after the occurrence of a Casualty or Condemnation affecting
         such Individual Property pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
         related Qualified Lease, then (A) any related Net Proceeds shall be
         deposited with Lender (or any disbursing agent approved by Lender) and
         shall be disbursed by Lender (or any disbursing agent approved by
         Lender) to the applicable tenant for application to the Restoration of
         the related Individual Property in accordance with the terms and
         provisions of an escrow agreement among Borrower, the applicable tenant
         and Lender (or any disbursing agent approved by Lender), which escrow
         agreement (1) shall provide for the disbursement of the deposited Net
         Proceeds as the Restoration of the related Individual Property is
         completed in accordance with an Application and Certificate in the form
         of AIA Document G702 to be properly completed and executed by the
         applicable tenant's contractor (or by the applicable tenant if such
         tenant acts as its own contractor) and architect and submitted to
         Lender (or any disbursing agent approved by Lender) in connection with
         each disbursement of any portion of the deposited Net Proceeds, (2)
         shall provide for the disbursement of the portion of the deposited Net
         Proceeds that is the subject of any such completed and executed
         Application and Certificate within five (5) Business Days of receipt by
         Lender (or any disbursing agent approved by Lender) thereof, (3) shall
         provide for the release of the deposited Net Proceeds to Borrower if
         the applicable tenant shall fail to complete the Restoration of the
         related Individual Property in accordance with the related Qualified
         Lease, (4) shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Lender and
         (5) shall provide that such escrow agreement may not be modified or
         amended without the prior written consent of Lender; (B) Borrower shall
         immediately pay to Lender any related Net Proceeds released to Borrower
         by Lender (or any disbursing agent approved by Lender) pursuant to the
         escrow agreement described in clause (A) above, which Net Proceeds
         shall be applied in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section
         9.29(a)-(c); and (C) the terms and provisions of this Section 9.29
         shall be deemed to be satisfied so long as the applicable tenant
         diligently pursues and completes the Restoration of such Individual
         Property in accordance with the terms and provisions of the related
         Qualified Lease. If Borrower shall elect to restore any Individual
         Property affected by a Casualty or Condemnation pursuant to the terms
         and provisions of the related Qualified Lease, Borrower's rights and
         obligations with respect to the related Restoration and Net Proceeds
         shall be as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.29.

                  9.30 Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund.

                  (a) Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. Borrower shall pay to
         Lender on each date a payment of interest on the Loan is due (i)
         one-twelfth of the Taxes that Lender



                                       91

         estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months in
         order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Taxes
         at least thirty (30) days prior to their respective due dates, and (ii)
         one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that Lender estimates will be
         payable for the renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon
         the expiration thereof in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient
         funds to pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days
         prior to the expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b)
         above hereinafter called the "TAX AND INSURANCE ESCROW FUND"). The Tax
         and Insurance Escrow Fund and the payments of interest or principal or
         both, payable pursuant to the Note, shall be added together and shall
         be paid as an aggregate sum by Borrower to Lender. Lender will apply
         the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and Insurance
         Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and
         under the Mortgages. In making any payment relating to the Tax and
         Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill,
         statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with
         respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance
         Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or
         estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture,
         tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount of the Tax and
         Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the actual amounts due for Taxes and
         Insurance Premiums, Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any
         excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to be
         made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. Any amount remaining in the
         Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund after the Loan and all of Borrower's
         other obligations to Lender have been paid in full shall be returned to
         Borrower. In allocating such excess, Lender may deal with the Person
         shown on the records of Lender to be the owner of the Individual
         Properties. If at any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax
         and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes
         and Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (i) and (ii) above,
         Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall
         increase its monthly payments to Lender by the amount that Lender
         estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30)
         days prior to delinquency of the Taxes and/or thirty (30) days prior to
         expiration of the Policies, as the case may be.

                  (b) Exemption from Tax and Insurance Escrow Requirements.
         Notwithstanding the terms and provisions of Section 9.30(a), Borrower
         shall not be required to contribute to the Tax and Insurance Escrow
         Fund, provided that (a) no Event of Default shall have occurred and (b)
         Borrower delivers, or causes the tenant under a Qualified Lease, to the
         extent applicable, to deliver, to Lender (i) receipts for payment or
         other evidence satisfactory to Lender that the Taxes and Other Charges
         with respect to each Individual Property have been paid no later than
         ten (10) days prior to the date the same shall become delinquent
         (unless Borrower or the tenant under a Qualified Lease, to the extent
         applicable, is contesting such Taxes or Other Charges in accordance
         with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
         Documents) and (ii) written evidence satisfactory to Lender that all
         Policies required pursuant to Section 9.05 and by the Mortgage are in
         full force and effect and that all related Insurance Premiums have been
         paid no later than ten (10) days prior to the expiration dates of such
         Policies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or notice from
         Lender that the terms and provisions of clause (b)(i) or clause (b)(ii)
         above have not been satisfied, Borrower shall begin to make monthly
         payments to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund in accordance with the


                                       92
<PAGE>

         terms and provisions of Section 9.30(a) commencing on the next date
         interest is due to be paid to Lender.

                  9.31 Replacements and Replacement Reserve.

                  (a) Replacement Reserve Fund. Borrower shall pay to Lender on
         each date a payment of interest on the Loan is due one-twelfth (1/12)
         of the amount (the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE MONTHLY DEPOSIT") reasonably
         estimated by Lender in its sole discretion to be due for replacements
         and repairs required to be made to the Individual Properties during the
         calendar year in order to maintain the Individual Properties in a first
         class condition (collectively, the "REPLACEMENTS"). Amounts so
         deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "REPLACEMENT
         RESERVE FUND" and the account in which such amounts are held shall
         hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "REPLACEMENT RESERVE ACCOUNT."
         Lender may reassess its estimate of the amount necessary for the
         Replacement Reserve Fund from time to time, and may increase the
         monthly amounts required to be deposited into the Replacement Reserve
         Fund upon thirty (30) days notice to Borrower if Lender determines in
         its reasonable discretion that an increase is necessary to maintain the
         proper maintenance and operation of the Individual Properties. Any
         amount held in the Replacement Reserve Account and allocated for an
         Individual Property shall be retained by Lender and credited toward the
         future Replacement Reserves Monthly Deposits required by Lender
         hereunder in the event such Individual Property is released from the
         Lien of its related Mortgage in accordance with the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Disbursements from Replacement Reserve Account.

                           (i) Lender shall make disbursements from the
                  Replacement Reserve Account to pay Borrower only for the costs
                  of the Replacements. Lender shall not be obligated to make
                  disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account to
                  reimburse Borrower for the costs of routine maintenance to an
                  Individual Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed
                  from the Required Repair Fund.

                           (ii) Lender shall, upon written request from Borrower
                  and satisfaction of the requirements set forth in this Section
                  9.31(b), disburse to Borrower amounts from the Replacement
                  Reserve Account necessary to pay for the actual approved costs
                  of Replacements or to reimburse Borrower therefor, upon
                  completion of such Replacements (or, upon partial completion
                  in the case of Replacements made pursuant to Section
                  9.31(b)(v) as determined by Lender. In no event shall Lender
                  be obligated to disburse funds from the Replacement Reserve
                  Account if a Default or an Event of Default exists.

                           (iii) Each request for disbursement from the
                  Replacement Reserve Account shall be in a form specified or
                  approved by Lender and shall specify (i) the specific
                  Replacements for which the disbursement is requested, (ii) the
                  quantity and price of each item purchased, if the Replacement
                  includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (iii)
                  the price of all materials (grouped by type or category) used
                  in any Replacement other than the purchase or



                                       93
<PAGE>

                  replacement of specific items, and (iv) the cost of all
                  contracted labor or other services applicable to each
                  Replacement for which such request for disbursement is made.
                  With each request Borrower shall certify that all Replacements
                  have been made in accordance with all applicable Legal
                  Requirements of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
                  over the applicable Individual Property to which the
                  Replacements are being provided. Each request for disbursement
                  shall include copies of invoices for all items or materials
                  purchased and all contracted labor or services provided and,
                  unless Lender has agreed to issue joint checks as described
                  below in connection with a particular Replacement, each
                  request shall include evidence satisfactory to Lender of
                  payment of all such amounts. Except as provided in Section
                  9.31(b)(v), each request for disbursement from the Replacement
                  Reserve Account shall be made only after completion of the
                  Replacement for which disbursement is requested. Borrower
                  shall provide Lender evidence of completion satisfactory to
                  Lender in its reasonable judgment.

                           (iv) Borrower shall pay all invoices in connection
                  with the Replacements with respect to which a disbursement is
                  requested prior to submitting such request for disbursement
                  from the Replacement Reserve Account or, at the request of
                  Borrower, Lender will issue joint checks, payable to Borrower
                  and the contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic,
                  subcontractor or other party to whom payment is due in
                  connection with a Replacement. In the case of payments made by
                  joint check, Lender may require a waiver of lien from each
                  Person receiving payment prior to Lender's disbursement from
                  the Replacement Reserve Account. In addition, as a condition
                  to any disbursement, Lender may require Borrower to obtain
                  lien waivers from each contractor, supplier, materialman,
                  mechanic or subcontractor who receives payment in an amount
                  equal to or greater than Twenty-Five Thousand and NO/100
                  Dollars ($25,000) for completion of its work or delivery of
                  its materials. Any lien waiver delivered hereunder shall
                  conform to the requirements of applicable law and shall cover
                  all work performed and materials supplied (including equipment
                  and fixtures) for the applicable Individual Property by that
                  contractor, supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman
                  through the date covered by the current reimbursement request
                  (or, in the event that payment to such contractor, supplier,
                  subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a
                  joint check, the release of lien shall be effective through
                  the date covered by the previous release of funds request).

                           (v) If (i) the cost of a Replacement exceeds
                  Twenty-Five Thousand and NO/100 Dollars ($25,000), (ii) the
                  contractor performing such Replacement requires periodic
                  payments pursuant to terms of a written contract, and (iii)
                  Lender has approved in writing in advance such periodic
                  payments, a request for reimbursement from the Replacement
                  Reserve Account may be made after completion of a portion of
                  the work under such contract, provided (A) such contract
                  requires payment upon completion of such portion of the work,
                  (B) the materials for which the request is made are on site at
                  the applicable Individual Property and are properly secured or
                  have been installed in such Individual Property, (C) all other
                  conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have been


                                       94
<PAGE>

                  satisfied, (D) funds remaining in the Replacement Reserve
                  Account are, in Lender's judgment, sufficient to complete such
                  Replacement and other Replacements when required, and (E) if
                  required by Lender, each contractor or subcontractor receiving
                  payments under such contract shall provide a waiver of lien
                  with respect to amounts which have been paid to that
                  contractor or subcontractor.

                           (vi) Borrower shall not make a request for
                  disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account more
                  frequently than once in any calendar month and (except in
                  connection with the final disbursement) the total cost of all
                  Replacements in any request shall not be less than Twenty-Five
                  Thousand and NO/100 Dollars ($25,000.00).

                  (c) Performance of Replacements. Each of the following are and
         shall be subject to the terms of the Qualified Lease applicable
         thereto, if any:

                           (i) Borrower shall make, or cause the tenant under a
                  Qualified Lease, to the extent applicable, to make,
                  Replacements when required in order to keep each Individual
                  Property in condition and repair consistent with comparable
                  properties, including for Megaplex Properties, other movie
                  theater properties in the same market segment in metropolitan
                  areas comparable to the one in which the respective Megaplex
                  Property is located, and to keep each Individual Property or
                  any portion thereof from deteriorating. Borrower shall
                  complete all Replacements in a good and workmanlike manner as
                  soon as practicable following the commencement of making each
                  such Replacement.

                           (ii) Lender reserves the right, at its option, to
                  approve all contracts or work orders with materialmen,
                  mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors, contractors or other
                  parties providing labor or materials in connection with the
                  Replacements. Upon Lender's request, Borrower shall assign any
                  contract or subcontract to Lender.

                           (iii) In the event Lender determines in its
                  reasonable discretion that any Replacement is not being
                  performed in a workmanlike or timely manner or that any
                  Replacement has not been completed in a workmanlike or timely
                  manner, Lender shall have the option to withhold disbursement
                  for such unsatisfactory Replacement and to proceed under
                  existing contracts or to contract with third parties to
                  complete such Replacement and to apply the Replacement Reserve
                  Fund toward the labor and materials necessary to complete such
                  Replacement, without providing any prior notice to Borrower
                  and to exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender
                  upon an Event of Default hereunder.

                           (iv) In order to facilitate Lender's completion or
                  making of the Replacements pursuant to Section 9.31(c)(iii)
                  above, Borrower grants Lender the right to enter onto any
                  Individual Property and perform any and all work and labor
                  necessary to complete or make the Replacements and/or employ
                  watchmen to protect such Individual Property from damage. All
                  sums so expended by


                                       95
<PAGE>

                  Lender, to the extent not from the Replacement Reserve Fund,
                  shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to
                  Borrower and secured by the Mortgages and all other security
                  for the Loan. For this purpose Borrower constitutes and
                  appoints Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full
                  power of substitution to complete or undertake the
                  Replacements in the name of Borrower. Such power of attorney
                  shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and
                  cannot be revoked. Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as
                  follows: (i) to use any funds in the Replacement Reserve
                  Account for the purpose of making or completing the
                  Replacements; (ii) to make such additions, changes and
                  corrections to the Replacements as shall be necessary or
                  desirable to complete the Replacements; (iii) to employ such
                  contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors
                  as shall be required for such purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or
                  compromise all existing bills and claims which are or may
                  become Liens against any Individual Property, or as may be
                  necessary or desirable for the completion of the Replacements,
                  or for clearance of title; (v) to execute all applications and
                  certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by
                  any of the contract documents; (vi) to prosecute and defend
                  all actions or proceedings in connection with any Individual
                  Property or the rehabilitation and repair of any Individual
                  Property; and (vii) to do any and every act which Borrower
                  might do in its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this
                  Agreement.

                           (v) Nothing in this Section 9.31 shall: (i) make
                  Lender responsible for making or completing the Replacements;
                  (ii) require Lender to expend funds in addition to the
                  Replacement Reserve Fund to make or complete any Replacement;
                  (iii) obligate Lender to proceed with the Replacements; or
                  (iv) obligate Lender to demand from Borrower additional sums
                  to make or complete any Replacement.

                           (vi) Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents
                  and representatives (including Lender's engineer, architect,
                  or inspector) or third parties making Replacements pursuant to
                  this Section 9.31 to enter onto each Individual Property
                  during normal business hours (subject to the rights of tenants
                  under their Qualified Leases) to inspect the progress of any
                  Replacements and all materials being used in connection
                  therewith, to examine all plans and shop drawings relating to
                  such Replacements which are or may be kept at each Individual
                  Property, and to complete any Replacements made pursuant to
                  this Section 9.31. Borrower shall cause all contractors and
                  subcontractors to cooperate with Lender or Lender's
                  representatives or such other persons described above in
                  connection with inspections described in this Section
                  9.31(cxvi) or the completion of Replacements pursuant to this
                  Section 9.31.

                           (vii) Lender may require an inspection of the
                  Individual Property at Borrower's expense prior to making a
                  disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account in order to
                  verify completion of the Replacements for which reimbursement
                  is sought. Lender may require that such inspection be
                  conducted by an appropriate independent qualified professional
                  selected by Lender and/or may require a copy of a certificate
                  of completion by an independent qualified professional
                  acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of any amounts
                  from



                                       96

                  the Replacement Reserve Account. Borrower shall pay the
                  expense of the inspection as required hereunder, whether such
                  inspection is conducted by Lender or by an independent
                  qualified professional.

                           (viii) The Replacements and all materials, equipment,
                  fixtures, or any other item comprising a part of any
                  Replacement shall be constructed, installed or completed, as
                  applicable, free and clear of all mechanics', materialmen's or
                  other liens (except for those Liens existing on the Original
                  Effective Date which have been approved in writing by Lender).

                           (ix) Before each disbursement from the Replacement
                  Reserve Account, Lender may require Borrower to provide Lender
                  with a search of title to the applicable Individual Property
                  effective to the date of the disbursement, which search shows
                  that no mechanics' or materialmen's liens or other liens of
                  any nature have been placed against the applicable Individual
                  Property since the date of recordation of the related Mortgage
                  and that title to such Individual Property is free and clear
                  of all Liens (other than the lien of the related Mortgage and
                  any other Liens previously approved in writing by Lender, if
                  any).

                           (x) All Replacements shall comply with all applicable
                  Legal Requirements of all Governmental Authorities having
                  jurisdiction over the applicable Individual Property and
                  applicable insurance requirements including, without
                  limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits,
                  environmental regulations, and requirements of insurance
                  underwriters.

                           (xi) In addition to any insurance required under the
                  Loan Documents, Borrower shall provide or cause to be provided
                  workmen's compensation insurance, builder's risk, and public
                  liability insurance and other insurance to the extent required
                  under applicable law in connection with a particular
                  Replacement. All such policies shall be in form and amount
                  reasonably satisfactory to Lender. All such policies which can
                  be endorsed with standard mortgagee clauses making loss
                  payable to Lender or its assigns shall be so endorsed.
                  Certified copies of such policies shall be delivered to
                  Lender.

                  (d) Failure to Make Replacements.

                           (i) It shall be an Event of Default under this
                  Agreement if Borrower fails to comply with any provision of
                  this Section 9.31 and such failure is not cured within thirty
                  (30) days after notice from Lender. Upon the occurrence of
                  such an Event of Default, Lender may use the Replacement
                  Reserve Fund (or any portion thereof) for any purpose,
                  including but not limited to completion of the Replacements as
                  provided in Section 9.31, or for any other repair or
                  replacement to any Individual Property or toward payment of
                  the Loan or other obligations of Borrower to Lender in such
                  order, proportion and priority as Lender may determine in its
                  sole discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and apply the
                  Replacement Reserve Funds shall be in addition to all other
                  rights and remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement
                  and the other Loan Documents.

                           (ii) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Lender
                  to apply all or any portion of the Replacement Reserve Fund on
                  account of an Event of Default to payment of the Loan or other
                  amounts owed by Borrower to Lender pursuant to the Loan
                  Documents or in any specific order or priority.

                  (e) Balance in a Replacement Reserve Account. The
         insufficiency of any balance in the Replacement Reserve Account shall
         not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill all preservation
         and maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.

                  (f) Indemnification. Borrower shall indemnify Lender and hold
         Lender harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims,
         demands, liabilities, losses, damages, obligations and costs and
         expenses (including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
         expenses) arising from or in any way connected with the performance of
         the Replacements. Borrower shall assign to Lender all rights and claims
         Borrower may have against all persons or entities supplying labor or
         materials in connection with the Replacements; provided, however, that
         Lender may not pursue any such right or claim unless an Event of
         Default has occurred and remains uncured.

                  (g) Exemption from Replacement Reserve Fund Requirements.
         Notwithstanding the terms and provisions of Section 9.31(a) and Section
         9.31(b), Borrower shall not be required to make the Replacement Reserve
         Monthly Deposit, provided that (a) no Event of Default shall have
         occurred and (b) Borrower makes, or causes the applicable tenant under
         a Qualified Lease to make, the Replacements in accordance with the
         terms and provisions of this Section 9.31. Upon (i) the occurrence of
         an Event of Default or (ii) Borrower's failure to make, or cause to be
         made, all Replacements in accordance with the terms and provisions of
         this Section 9.31 within ten (10) days after notice of such failure
         from Lender, Borrower shall begin to make the Replacement Reserve
         Monthly Deposit in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section
         9.31(a) commencing on the next date interest is due to be paid to
         Lender.

                  9.32 Ground Lease Reserve Fund.

                  (a) Deposits to Ground Lease Fund. On each date a payment of
         interest is due after the date hereof and so long as an Obligor is a
         tenant under a Ground Lease, Borrower shall pay to Lender one-twelfth
         of the rents (including both base and additional rents) and other
         charges that Lender estimates will be payable by the applicable Obligor
         as tenant under the Ground Leases (collectively, "GROUND RENTS") during
         the next ensuing twelve (12) months in order to accumulate with Lender
         sufficient funds to pay all such rents and other charges at least
         thirty (30) days prior to their respective due dates. Amounts so
         deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the "GROUND LEASE RESERVE
         FUND" and the account in which such amounts are held shall hereinafter
         be referred to as the "Ground Lease Reserve Account."

                  (b) Release of Ground Lease Funds. Lender shall have the right
         to apply the Ground Lease Funds to payment of rents and other charges
         due under any Ground Lease. In making any payment relating to rents and
         other charges under any Ground Lease, Lender may do so according to any
         bill, statement or estimate procured from the lessor



                                       98
<PAGE>

         under such Ground Lease, without inquiry into the accuracy of such
         bill, statement or estimate. If the amount of Ground Lease Reserve
         Funds shall exceed the amounts due for rents and other charges under
         the Ground Leases for the immediately succeeding twelve (12) months as
         determined by Lender, Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any
         excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to be
         made to the Ground Lease Funds. Any Ground Lease Funds remaining after
         the Loan and all other obligations of Borrower to Lender under the Loan
         Documents have been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower.

                  (c) Exemption from Ground Lease Reserve Fund Requirements.
         Notwithstanding the terms and provisions of Section 9.32(a) and Section
         9.32(b), Borrower shall not be required to contribute to the Ground
         Lease Reserve Fund provided that (a) no Event of Default shall have
         occurred, (b) the ground lessors under the Ground Leases shall remain
         obligated to notify Lender of any default by Borrower, as tenant, under
         the Ground Leases and permit Lender a reasonable opportunity to cure
         such default and (c) no payment or other default by Borrower, as
         tenant, shall have occurred under any Ground Lease. Upon the occurrence
         of an Event of Default or notice from Lender that the conditions set
         forth in clauses (b) or (c) above have not been satisfied, Borrower
         shall begin to make payments to the Ground Lease Reserve Fund in
         accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 9.32(a) commencing
         on the next date interest is due to be paid to Lender.

                  9.33 Intentionally Deleted.

                  9.34 Independent Directors. Within thirty days of Lender's
         written request (which may be given at any time and in Lender's sole
         discretion), Borrower shall cause Megaplex Owner, Archon SPE holdings,
         or both, to have at least two Independent Directors and cause the
         articles of incorporation for such Persons to be amended to require
         such two Independent Directors, and thereafter will not cause or allow
         the board of directors of such entity to take any action requiring the
         unanimous affirmative vote of one hundred percent (100%) of the members
         of its board of directors unless two Independent Directors shall have
         participated in such vote.

                  9.35 Substitution Rights. From time to time Borrower may
         request the right to sell an existing Megaplex Property and have it be
         released from the Mortgage Lien and, simultaneously with such sale,
         acquire a new Real Estate Property which is a reasonably comparable
         theater property which would become a Megaplex Property under the Loan
         Documents and be subject to the Lien of a Mortgage securing the Loan
         and other obligations of Obligors to Lender. If Lender consents to such
         request (which consent can be granted, withheld or conditioned in
         Lender's sole discretion), Borrower shall comply (i) with all of the
         provisions of Section 7.03(c) (other than the requirement of using Loan
         proceeds) for the acquisition of additional Real Estate Properties plus
         appropriate title insurance and other deliveries so that Lender's
         position and information about such new property is comparable with
         Lender's position and information relating to the Initial Megaplex
         Properties, and (ii) with such other conditions as Lender may impose in
         its sole and absolute condition. If Lender does not consent to such
         request, Lender shall have no obligation to release its Mortgage Lien
         on such existing Megaplex Property or otherwise consent to any sale or
         disposition of such Megaplex Property.

                  9.36 Reserve Funds, Generally.

                  (a) Borrower grants to Lender a first priority perfected
         security interest in each Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund, Replacement
         Reserve Fund, Ground Lease Reserve Fund, the Required Repairs Fund, and
         any other escrow or reserve fund established by the Loan Documents
         (each such fund is herein called a "RESERVE Fund" and collectively, the
         "RESERVE FUNDS") and any and all monies now or hereafter deposited in
         each Reserve Fund as additional security for payment of the Loan and
         other obligations of Borrower to Lender. Until expended or applied in
         accordance herewith, the Reserve Funds shall constitute additional
         security for the Loan and other obligations of Borrower to Lender.

                  (b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may, in
         addition to any and all other rights and remedies available to Lender,
         apply any sums then present in any or all of the Reserve Funds to the
         payment of the Loan and other obligations of Borrower to Lender in any
         order in its sole discretion.

                  (c) The Reserve Funds shall not constitute trust funds and may
         be commingled with other monies held by Lender.

                  (d) Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written
         consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security
         interest in any Reserve Fund or the monies deposited therein or permit
         any lien or encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to be made
         thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements, except those naming Lender
         as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

                  9.37 Archon Securitization Loan Documents. Borrower shall
cause Archon SPE Holdings and Securitization Property Owner at all times to
comply with and not permit an event of default to occur under the Archon
Securitization Loan Documents. Borrower shall not permit Archon SPE Holdings or
Securitization Property Owner to amend or modify the Archon Securitization Loan
Documents without Lender's prior written consent. Additionally, Borrower shall
use its best efforts to cause, on or before November 19, 2001, Archon SPE
Holdings and Securitization Property Owner to amend the Archon Securitized Loan
Documents to permit, without further action or consent (other than notice to any
party), Lender or its designee, to foreclose or otherwise take title to and
assume all ownership rights with respect to the stock which is pledged to Lender
pursuant to the Pledge Agreement and to enter into an intercreditor agreement
with Lender, all in forms reasonably acceptable to Lender (the foregoing
requirements to obtain such amendment and intercreditor agreement, to the extent
not waived by Lender as provided in the last sentence of this Section 9.37, are
collectively referred to herein as the "ARCHON REQUIRED AMENDMENTS"). Lender
agrees to negotiate in good faith and on a commercially reasonable basis in
obtaining Archon Required Amendments. Lender reserves the right, but is under no
obligation, to waive (as Lender determines in its sole and absolute discretion)
all or any portion of the requirements that Borrower obtain the Archon Required
Amendments.

                  9.40 Required Repairs Fund.

                  (a) Borrower shall perform, or shall cause Megaplex Owner or
         the tenant under the applicable Qualified Lease to perform, the repairs

         Schedule 9.40 hereto (such repairs hereinafter referred to as "REQUIRED
         REPAIRS"). Borrower shall complete, or shall cause Megaplex Owner or
         the tenant under the applicable Qualified Lease to complete, the
         Required Repairs on or before the required deadline for each repair as
         set forth on Schedule 9.40. It shall be an Event of Default under this
         Agreement if (a) Borrower does not complete, or cause to be completed,
         the Required Repairs at each Individual Owned Property by the required
         deadline for each repair as set forth on Schedule 9.40, and (b)
         Borrower does not satisfy each condition contained in 9.40(b) hereof.
         Upon the occurrence of such an Event of Default, Lender, at its option,

         Repairs at one or more of the Individual Owned Properties or toward
         payment of the Loan and other obligations owed by Borrower to Lender in
         such order, proportion and priority as Lender may determine in its sole
         discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and apply Required Repair Funds
         shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided to
         Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. On the
         Original Effective Date, Borrower deposited with Lender the amount for
         each Individual Owned Property set forth on such Schedule 9.40 hereto
         to perform the Required Repairs for such Individual Owned Property.
         Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's
         "REQUIRED REPAIR FUND" and the accounts are held shall hereinafter be
         referred to as Borrower's "REQUIRED REPAIR ACCOUNT."

                  (b) Lender shall disburse to Borrower the Required Repair
         Funds from the Required Repair Account from time to time upon
         satisfaction by Borrower of each of the following conditions: (a)

         thirty (30) days prior to the date on which Borrower requests such
         payment be made and specifies the Required Repairs to be paid, (b) on
         the date such request is received by Lender and on the date such
         payment is to be made, no Default or Event of Default shall exist and
         remain uncured, (c) Lender shall have received a certificate from
         Borrower (i) stating that all Required Repairs at the applicable
         Individual Owned Property to be funded by the requested disbursement
         have been completed in good and workmanlike manner and in accordance
         with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and
         regulations, such certificate to be accompanied by a copy of any
         license, permit or other approval by any Governmental Authority
         required to commence and/or complete the Required Repairs, (ii)
         identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor in connection
         with the Required Repairs performed at such Individual Owned Property
         to be funded by the requested disbursement, and (iii) stating that each
         such Person has been paid in full or will be paid in full upon such
         disbursement, such certificate to be accompanied by lien waivers or
         other evidence of payment satisfactory to Lender, (d) at Lender's
         option, a title search for such Individual Owned Property indicating
         that such Individual Owned Property is free from all liens, claims and
         other encumbrances not previously approved by Lender, and (e) Lender
         shall have received such other evidence



                                      101
<PAGE>

         as Lender shall reasonably request that the Required Repairs at such
         Individual Owned Property to be funded by the requested disbursement
         have been completed and are paid for or will be paid upon such
         disbursement to Borrower. Lender shall not be required to make
         disbursements form the Required Repair Account with respect to any
         Individual Owned Property unless such requested disbursement is in an
         amount greater than Twenty-Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($25,000)
         (or a lesser amount if the total amount in the Required Repair Account
         is less than Twenty-Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($25,000), in
         which case only one disbursement of the amount remaining in the account
         shall be made) and such disbursement shall be made only upon
         satisfaction of each condition contained in this Section 9.40(b).

(herein called "EVENTS OF DEFAULT") shall occur and be continuing:

                  (a) Borrower shall default in the payment of any principal of

         hereunder or under any other Loan Document when due and such default
         shall, in the case of (ii) or (iii), have continued unremedied for more

         modification or supplement hereto or thereto) by Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries, or any certificate furnished by any Obligor, to Lender
         pursuant to the provisions hereof or thereof, shall prove to have been
         false or misleading as of the time made or furnished in any material
         respect (except to the extent derived from Tenant Information which
         Borrower did not know was incorrect); or

                  (d) any Obligor shall default in the performance of any of its
         obligations under any of Sections 9.03, 9.04 (as to its legal existence
         and REIT status), 9.05, 9.06, 9.07, 9.08, 9.09, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12, 9.13,

                  (e) any Obligor shall fail to observe or perform any covenant,
         condition or agreement contained in this Agreement (other than those
         specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of this Section 10) or any other
         Loan Document and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period
         of 30 or more days after notice thereof to Borrower by Lender; or

                  (f) Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall default in the
         payment when due of any principal of or interest on any of its other
         Indebtedness aggregating $2,500,000 or more; or Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries shall default in the payment when due of any amount
         aggregating $2,500,000 or more under any Hedging Agreement and, in
         either case, shall not have cured such default within the applicable

         aggregating $2,500,000 or more of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
         shall occur if the effect of such event is to cause, or (with the
         giving of any notice or the lapse of time or both) to permit the holder
         or holders of such Indebtedness (or a trustee or agent on behalf of
         such holder or holders) to cause, such Indebtedness to become due, or
         to require that it be prepaid in full (whether by redemption, purchase,
         offer to purchase or otherwise), prior to its stated maturity or to
         have the interest rate thereon reset to a level so that securities
         evidencing such Indebtedness trade at a higher level; or any event
         specified in any Hedging Agreement shall occur if the effect of such
         event is to cause, or (with the giving of any notice or the lapse of
         time or both) to permit, termination or liquidation payment or payments
         aggregating $2,500,000 or more to become due; or

                  (h) a proceeding or case shall be commenced, without the
         application or consent of Borrower or its affected Subsidiary, in any
         court of competent jurisdiction, seeking (i) its reorganization,
         liquidation, dissolution (other than the planned dissolution of Excel
         Westminster AMC, Inc.), arrangement or winding-up, or the composition
         or readjustment of its debts, (ii) the appointment of a receiver,
         custodian, trustee, examiner, liquidator or the like of Borrower or
         such Subsidiary or of all or any substantial part of its Property, or
         (iii) similar relief in respect of Borrower or such Subsidiary under
         any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, winding-up,
         or composition or adjustment of debts, and such proceeding or case
         shall continue undismissed, or an order, judgment or decree approving
         or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered and continue unstayed
         and in effect, for a period of 60 or more days; or an order for relief
         against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be entered in an
         involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code; or

                  (i) Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall (i) apply for or
         consent to the appointment of, or the taking of possession by, a
         receiver, custodian, trustee, examiner or liquidator of itself or of
         all or a substantial part of its Property, (ii) make a general
         assignment for the benefit of its creditors, (iii) commence a voluntary

         composition or readjustment of debts, (v) fail to controvert in a
         timely and appropriate manner, or acquiesce in writing to, any petition
         filed against it in an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or
         (vi) take any corporate action for the purpose of effecting any of the
         foregoing (other than for the planned dissolution of Excel Westminster
         AMC, Inc.); or

                  (j) Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall admit in writing
         its inability to, or be generally unable to, pay its debts as such
         debts become due; or

                  (k) a final judgment or judgments for the payment of money of
         $2,500,000 or more in the aggregate (exclusive of judgment amounts
         covered by insurance where the insurer has admitted or failed to deny
         liability in respect of such judgment) shall be rendered by one or more
         courts, administrative tribunals or other bodies having jurisdiction
         against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and the same shall not be





                                      103

         discharged (or provision shall not be made for such discharge), or a
         stay of execution thereof shall not be procured, within 30 days from
         the date of entry thereof or Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary shall
         not, within such period of 30 days, or such longer period during which
         execution of the same shall have been stayed, appeal therefrom and
         cause the execution thereof to be stayed during such appeal; or

                  (l) an event or condition shall occur or exist with respect to
         any Plan or Multiemployer Plan and, as a result of such event or
         condition, together with all other such events or conditions, Borrower
         or any ERISA Affiliate shall incur or in the opinion of the Lender
         shall be reasonably likely to incur a liability to a Plan, a
         Multiemployer Plan or the PBGC (or any combination of the foregoing)
         that, in the determination of the Lender, would (either individually or
         in the aggregate) have a Material Adverse Effect; or

                  (m) there shall have been asserted against Borrower or any of
         its Subsidiaries an Environmental Claim that, in the judgment of the
         Lender, is reasonably likely to be determined adversely to Borrower or
         any of its Subsidiaries, and the amount thereof (either individually or
         in the aggregate) is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
         Effect (insofar as such amount is payable by Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries but after deducting any portion thereof that is reasonably
         expected to be covered by insurance or paid by other creditworthy
         Persons jointly and severally liable therefor); or

                  (n) a Change in Control of any Obligor shall occur; or

                  (o) If Borrower has not borrowed all of Tranche B by November
         19, 2001 (or such longer period as Lender may elect in its sole
         discretion); provided, however, that it shall not be an Event of
         Default under this subsection (p) if the sole reason for Borrower's
         failure to borrow all of Tranche B within such time frame is Borrower's
         failure to obtain the Archon Required Amendments after otherwise
         complying with the terms of Section 9.37; or

                  (p) any "Event of Default" under any other provision of this
         Agreement or any other Loan Document.

         THEREUPON: (1) in the case of an Event of Default other than one
referred to in clause (h) or (i) of this Section 10 with respect to any Obligor,
Lender may, by notice to Borrower, terminate the obligation of Lender to advance
Loan Proceeds and/or declare the principal amount then outstanding of, and the
accrued interest on, the Loan and all other amounts payable by the Obligors
hereunder and under the Note (including any amounts payable under Section 5.03)
to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon such amounts shall be immediately due
and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Obligor; and (2) in the
case of the occurrence of an Event of Default referred to in clause (h) or (i)
of this Section 10 with respect to any Obligor, the obligation of Lender to
advance Loan Proceeds shall automatically be terminated and the principal amount
then outstanding of, and the accrued interest on, the Loan, and all other
amounts payable by the Obligors hereunder and under the Note (including any
amounts payable under Section 5.03) shall automatically become immediately due
and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Obligor.

         Section 11. Current Balances. Attached as Exhibit J is a list of the
full amount of the Loan advanced, interest owed, and amounts held in Reserves as
of the date set forth on such exhibit. Borrower, the Subsidiary Guarantors, and
Lender each acknowledge and agree that such amounts are true, correct, and
complete as of such date.

         Section 12. Miscellaneous.

                  12.01 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications
provided for herein (including any modifications of, or waivers or consents
under, this Agreement) shall be given or made in writing (including by
telecopy), delivered to the intended recipient at the "Address for Notices"
specified below its name on the signature pages hereof (below the name of
Borrower, in the case of any Subsidiary Guarantor); or, as to any party, at such
other address as shall be designated by such party in a notice to each other
party. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all such communications
shall be deemed to have been duly given when transmitted by telecopier or
personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice, upon receipt, in each
case given or addressed as aforesaid.

                  12.02 Waiver. No failure on the part of the Lender to exercise
and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right,
power or privilege under this Agreement or Note shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement or Note preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies
provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by
law.

                  12.03 Amendments, Etc. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, any provision of this Agreement may be modified or
supplemented only by an instrument in writing signed by Borrower and Lender and
any provision of this Agreement may be waived by Lender.

                  12.04 Expenses, Etc. Borrower agrees to pay or reimburse
Lender, upon demand from Lender, for: (a) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of Lender (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
expenses of Katten Muchin Zavis, special counsel to Lender and the reasonable
fees and expenses of Lender's special state counsel) in connection with (i) the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and the extension of credit hereunder and (ii) the negotiation or
preparation of any modification, supplement or waiver of any of the terms of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (whether or not consummated);
(b) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Lender (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with (i) any
Default and any enforcement or collection proceedings resulting therefrom,
including, without limitation, all manner of participation in or other
involvement with (x) bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, foreclosure, winding
up or liquidation proceedings, (y) judicial or regulatory proceedings and (z)
workout, restructuring or other negotiations or proceedings (whether or not the
workout, restructuring or transaction contemplated thereby is consummated) and
(ii) the enforcement of this Section 12.04; and (c) all transfer, stamp,
documentary or other similar taxes, assessments or charges levied by any
Governmental Authority in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or any other document referred to herein or therein.



                                      105

         Borrower hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold each of the
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, any and all losses, liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses incurred by any of them, whether or not Lender is a
party thereto) arising out of or by reason of any investigation or litigation or
other proceedings (including any threatened investigation or litigation or other
proceedings) relating to the extensions of credit hereunder or any actual or
proposed use by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of the proceeds of any of
the extensions of credit hereunder, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any
such investigation or litigation or other proceedings (but excluding any such
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by reason of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified or such
Indemnified Party's material breach of this Agreement, or claims against such
Indemnified Party arising from its own acts or omissions to the extent wholly
unrelated to this Agreement). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Borrower will defend, indemnify and hold each of the Indemnified Parties
harmless against, any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses described
in the preceding sentence (but excluding, as provided in the preceding sentence,
any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense incurred by reason of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified or such
Indemnified Party's material breach of this Agreement, or claims against such
Indemnified Party arising from its own acts or omissions to the extent wholly
unrelated to this Agreement) arising under any Environmental Law as a result of
the past, present or future operations of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
or the past, present or future condition of any site or facility owned, operated
or leased at any time by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Release or
threatened Release of any Hazardous Materials at or from any such site or
facility, excluding any such Release or threatened Release that shall occur
during any period when Lender shall be in possession of any such site or
facility following the exercise by the Lender of any of its rights and remedies
hereunder, but including any such Release or threatened Release occurring during
such period that is a continuation of conditions previously in existence, or of
practices employed by Borrower and its Subsidiaries, at such site or facility.

                  12.05 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

                  12.06 Assignments by Obligors. No Obligor may assign any of
its rights or obligations hereunder or under the Note without the prior consent
of the Lender.

                  12.07 Secondary Market Transaction in Loan and Note. Borrower
and each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that Lender has the absolute right to
securitize, sell, assign, pledge, syndicate, grant participations in, or
otherwise dispose of, all or any portion of the Loan (each such transaction, a
"SECURITIZATION"). Lender may determine to resell some or all of the Loan or
retain title to some or all of the Loan as part of a Securitization. Provided
that the following are at no material additional expense to any Obligor (other
than expenses which an Obligor is otherwise obligated to pay pursuant the Loan
Documents), do not create any additional material obligations of any Obligor or
materially adversely affect any Obligor's rights under the Loan Documents:

                  (a) Borrower agrees that Borrower shall cooperate, and
         Borrower shall cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to cooperate, in all
         reasonable respects at the request of Lender in connection with any
         such Securitization, including in connection with any



                                      106
<PAGE>

         documentation changes and any site inspections, updated appraisals,
         financial information (including financial statements and other
         financial information as described in this Agreement) or other
         diligence requested or conducted by any investors, and/or any Rating
         Agency, whether before or after funding. In connection with any
         Securitization, Lender may, among other things, in its sole discretion,
         determine to (i) reconstitute the Loan such that it is recast into
         multiple loans of such priorities and terms as Lender may determine (so
         long as the economic terms of the Loan do not, in the aggregate,
         materially change), and/or (ii) sever the Loan or any tranche thereof
         into two or more self-contained, internally cross-collateralized
         mortgage loan financings (any of all of the foregoing, a "LOAN
         RECONSTITUTION"). Borrower agrees that Borrower will reasonably
         cooperate, and cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to reasonably cooperate,
         in all material respects at the request of the Lender in connection
         with any such Loan Reconstitution.

                  (b) Without in any way limiting the generality of the
         foregoing, each Obligor agrees that Lender may, among other things, in
         its sole discretion, elect to effect a Loan Reconstitution pursuant to
         which the Loan is recast into a senior loan tranche (the "SENIOR
         TRANCHE") and a junior loan tranche (the "JUNIOR TRANCHE") as follows:
         (i) the principal amount of each of the Senior Tranche and the Junior
         Tranche will be determined by Lender in its sole discretion (provided
         that the aggregate principal amount thereof shall not exceed the
         aggregate principal amount of the Loan outstanding immediately prior to
         such Loan Reconstitution); (ii) the interest rate applicable to each of
         the Senior Tranche and the Junior Tranche shall be determined by Lender
         in its sole discretion (provided that the blended interest rate from
         time to time applicable to the Senior Tranche and the Junior Tranche
         and the payments as a result thereof shall not exceed the interest rate
         and the payments as a result thereof which, but for such Loan
         Reconstitution, would have been applicable from time to time under the
         Loan pursuant to this Agreement), (iii) the Senior Tranche will
         continue to be evidenced and secured by the Loan Documents and the
         Junior Tranche will be evidenced and secured by one (1) or more pledge
         agreements of all of the stock, shares, partnership interests,
         membership interests, beneficial interests or other ownership interests
         in Obligors and by other loan documents which are substantially in the
         forms of the Loan Documents, in each case with such documentation
         changes as Lender may reasonably request (1) to evidence the principal
         amount of and interest rate applicable to each of the Senior Tranche
         and the Junior Tranche and the subordination of the Junior Tranche to
         the Senior Tranche, (2) at Lender's election to cause the Senior
         Tranche to cross-default the Junior Tranche and/or the Junior Tranche
         to cross default the Senior Tranche, (3) at Lender's election, to cause
         certain of the provisions of this Agreement (including, without
         limitation, the definition of or affecting financial ratios and the
         release price calculations) to be applicable to the Senior Tranche and
         the Junior Tranche on an aggregate basis, (4) at Lender's election, the
         pledgor(s) under the pledge agreement securing the Junior Tranche shall
         be the obligor(s) with regard to the Junior Tranche, Borrower shall
         cause the pledgors in question to execute the applicable documentation
         required by Lender and the applicable Obligor will no longer be an
         obligor with regard to the portion of the Loan represented by the
         Junior Tranche; and (5) to reflect such other documentation changes
         and/or changes to the structure of the Loan and the organizational
         documents of each Obligor and the other pledgors, if any, as Lender may
         reasonably request in connection with the Senior Tranche



                                      107
<PAGE>

         and/or the Junior Tranche. At Lender's election, the Senior Tranche and
         Junior Tranche may each be subject to one or more Securitizations.

                  (c) Except to the extent the Loan Documents otherwise require,
         Obligors shall not be required to pay for material third party
         out-of-pocket costs and expenses which are incurred in a Securitization
         subsequent to the Closing Date.

                  (d) Without in any way limiting the generality of the
         foregoing, each Obligor agrees that, in order to implement a
         Securitization involving a public offering or private placement of
         certificates ("CERTIFICATES"), (i) Lender may transfer, pledge or
         assign to one or more of a depositor, indenture trust, owner trust or
         other trust (collectively, a "DEPOSITOR") all right, title and interest
         of Lender in, to and under the Loan and the Loan Documents, (ii) if
         such Securitization is a public offering of Certificates, some or all
         of Lenders in, or the Depositor, as the case may be, may exercise the
         Replacement Option, and (iii) the Depositor may enter into a pooling
         and servicing agreement or other agreement which provides for issuance
         of the Certificates (the "POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT"). Pursuant
         to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Depositor will assign,
         pledge or grant to the certificate trustee (or to the indenture
         trustee, as trustee, if such Securitization involves a public or
         private offering of Certificates), among other things, all of the
         Depositor's right, title and interest in, to and under each of the Loan
         Documents (as such Loan Documents may have therefore been amended or
         reconstituted, including in connection with the exercise of the
         Replacement Option, if applicable) and may grant to the certificate
         trustee (or to the indenture trustee, as trustee, if applicable in
         connection with a Securitization involving a public or private offering
         of Certificates) the full or any part of the exclusive and irrevocable
         right, power and authority to exercise or to determine to refrain from
         exercising, any rights, powers and privileges of the Lender under the
         Loan Documents, including, without limitation, (x) the right to grant
         or withhold any and all consents or approvals which may be requested or
         given pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,
         and the right to exercise any vote or abstain from voting on any matter
         on which a vote may be required hereunder or thereunder, including any
         determination to amend, modify, waiver or terminate any provision
         hereof or thereof, (y) the right to give and receive any and all
         notices, demands or other communication which are required to be, or
         may be, given hereunder or thereunder, and (z) the right to exercise or
         determine to refrain from exercising any and all rights and remedies
         hereunder or thereunder. For all purposes of this Agreement and the
         other Loan Documents, each Obligor may assume, and shall recognize,
         that upon such assignment (other than for collateral purposes and, if
         for collateral purposes, upon assignment in connection with the
         exercise of remedies or in lieu of the exercise of remedies) to the
         certificate trustee or the indenture trustee, as the case may be, the
         certificate trustee or the indenture trustee, as the case may be, shall
         be and become the Lender for all purposes hereunder and under the other
         Loan Documents and shall have all rights of Lender hereunder and
         thereunder, including, without limitation, the right to exercise or
         refrain from exercising any and all of such rights, powers and
         privileges. Each Obligor further agrees that the Depositor, Lender,
         certificate trustee and/or the indenture trustee may delegate any or
         all of Lender's rights, powers and privileges to a servicer
         ("SERVICER") and each Obligor shall recognize the Servicer as the agent
         of the certificate trustee and/or the indenture trustee, as the case
         may be.



                                      108
<PAGE>

                  (e) Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the Certificates
         representing beneficial interests in the Loan may be offered to the
         public in a transaction requiring registration under the Securities Act
         of 1933, as amended. In such event, the holder of the Loan (who at such
         time may be Lender, an administrative agent, as agent, for Lender or
         the Depositor) shall have the absolute right at any time in connection
         with effecting such Securitization, to exercise the Replacement Option,
         provided that each Obligor is afforded not less than 10 Business Days'
         prior written notice of the intention to exercise the Replacement
         Option. "REPLACEMENT OPTION," when used herein or in any of the other
         Loan Documents, shall mean the right and option of the then holder of
         the Loan to require Borrower to (i) execute and deliver an indenture
         (the "Indenture") with a trustee (which trustee shall be qualified to
         act as such under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and shall otherwise
         be selected by and satisfactory to the then holder of the Loan) which
         Indenture shall amend and restate this Agreement (or otherwise replace
         this Agreement) in its entirety insofar as it relates to the Loan, (ii)
         cooperate with the then holder of the Loan and any other required
         Persons in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the
         Trust Indenture Act of 1939, (iii) issue notes under and pursuant to
         the Indenture (the "INDENTURE NOTES"), which Indenture Notes shall be
         duly authenticated and delivered by the indenture trustee, in
         replacement of the Note evidencing the Loan, (iv) take all actions as
         are required to cause the Indenture Notes to be secured by the Loan
         Documents, and to ensure that the priority of the Mortgage is not
         impaired by virtue of such replacement of the Note with the Indenture
         Notes, and (v) cooperate with the then holder of the Loan in connection
         with the assignment of such holder's interest under the Loan Documents
         in question to the indenture trustee, as trustee for the benefit of the
         holder of the Indenture Notes.

                  (f) Each Obligor will, upon request from Lender, in connection
         with a Securitization, enter into such acknowledgments and
         confirmations of the applicable assignments as Lender may request.

                  12.08 Sale of Note and Securitization. At the request of the
holder of the Note and, to the extent not already required to be provided by an
Obligor under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, each Obligor shall,
subject to the terms and provisions of this Section 12.08, use reasonable
efforts to satisfy the market standards to which the holder of the Note
customarily adheres or which may be reasonably required in the marketplace or by
the Rating Agencies in connection with a Securitization, including using
reasonable efforts to do (or cause to be done) the following (but Obligors will
not in any event be required pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section
12.08 to incur, suffer or accept (except to a de minimis extent) (i) any lesser
rights or greater obligations as are currently set forth in the Loan Documents
or an Obligor's organizational documents (unless Borrower is made whole by the
holder of the Note), or (ii) except as expressly set forth in this Section
12.08, any expense:

                  (a) (i) provide such financial and other information as may be
         reasonably requested, subject to the terms and provisions hereof, with
         respect to the Individual Property, Borrower, Subsidiary Guarantors and
         their Subsidiaries and affiliates, and, to the extent in the possession
         of an Obligor and not subject to confidentiality restrictions, any
         tenants of any Individual Property, (ii) provide business plans and
         budgets relating to the Individual Property (and to the extent such
         information is readily available to



                                      109

         Borrower, the same shall be provided without cost to Lender) and (iii)
         to perform or permit or cause to be performed or permitted or allow
         Lender to perform such site inspection, appraisals, market studies,
         environmental reviews and reports (Phase I's and, if appropriate, Phase
         II's), engineering reports and other due diligence investigations of
         the Property, as may be reasonably requested by Lender or the Rating
         Agencies or as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the
         Securitization (the "Provided Information"), together, if customary,
         with appropriate verification and/or consents of the Provided
         Information to the extent reasonably obtainable, through letters of
         auditors, engineers or appraisers or opinions of counsel; and

                  (b) cause independent counsel to render opinions as to
         fraudulent conveyance or any other opinion customary in securitization
         transactions with respect to the Individual Property, and Borrower, and
         its affiliates (but not a true sale or 10b-5 opinion), including,
         without limitation, a nonconsolidation opinion and/or insolvency option
         acceptable to Lender and all applicable rating agencies, which counsel
         and opinions shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lender and the Rating
         Agencies and which shall be addressed to such Persons as shall be
         reasonably designated by the holder of the Note. Any Obligor's failure
         to deliver the opinions required hereby within such ten (10) Business
         Days after written request therefor shall constitute an "Event of
         Default" hereunder.

                  12.09 Cooperation with Rating Agencies. In the event this Loan
becomes an asset in or of a Securitization, Borrower agrees upon Lender's
request to meet with representatives of the Rating Agencies in connection with
such a Securitization to discuss the business and operations of the Individual
Properties and, in that regard, agrees to cooperate with the reasonable requests
of the Rating Agencies including, without limitation delivering any existing
environmental materials relating to the Individual Properties in Borrower's
possession.

                  12.10 Securitization Indemnification.

                  (a) Each Obligor understands that certain of the Provided
         Information and the information required to be delivered by Borrower
         hereunder (the "REQUIRED REPORTS") may be included in disclosure
         documents in connection with the Securitization, including a prospectus
         or private placement memorandum (each, a "DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT") and may
         also be included in filings with the United States Securities and
         Exchange Commission pursuant to applicable law, or provided or made
         available to investors or prospective investors in the Securities, the
         Rating Agencies, and service providers relating to the Securitization.
         In the event that the Disclosure Document is required to be revised
         prior to the sale of Securities or other transfer of ownership with
         respect to the Securitization, each Obligor will cooperate with the
         holder of the Note in updating the Provided Information or Required
         Reports for inclusion or summary in the Disclosure Document by
         providing all current information pertaining to any Obligor, any
         Subsidiary of an Obligor, and the Individual Properties necessary to
         keep the Disclosure Document accurate and complete in all material
         respects with respect to such matters.

                  (b) In connection with each of (x) a preliminary and a private
         placement memorandum or (y) a preliminary and final prospectus, as
         applicable, Borrower agrees to provide an indemnification certificate:

                           (i) provided Borrower has been requested by Lender to
                  do so, and if the applicable items have been revised to
                  reflect all of Borrower's comments, certifying that Borrower
                  has examined those portions of such memorandum or prospectus,
                  as applicable, expressly pertaining to any Obligor, any
                  Subsidiary of an Obligor, and the Individual Properties and
                  the Loan including applicable portions of the sections
                  entitled "Special Considerations," "Description of the
                  Mortgages," "Description of the Mortgage Loans and Mortgaged
                  Properties," "Borrower" and "Certain Legal Aspects of the
                  Mortgage Loan," (or analogous portions or sections) and such
                  sections (and any other sections reasonably requested and
                  pertaining to any Obligor, any Subsidiary of an Obligor, and
                  the Individual Properties or the Loan), all of which sections
                  have been identified to Borrower by Lender do not contain any
                  untrue statement of a material fact or, to the best of
                  Borrower's knowledge, omit to state a material fact necessary
                  in order to make the statements made, in the light of the
                  circumstances under which they were made, not materially
                  misleading as the applicable sections pertain to Borrower, the
                  Loan and the Properties;

                           (ii) indemnifying Lender and the Affiliates of Lender
                  that have filed a registration statement relating to the
                  Securitization (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), each of their
                  directors, each of their officers who have signed the
                  Registration Statement and each Person who controls Lender or
                  Lender Parent within the meaning of any federal or state
                  securities laws (collectively, the "LENDER GROUP"), any
                  underwriters selected by Lender or Lender Parent for the
                  Securitization, and each Person who controls the underwriters
                  in question, within the meaning of any federal or state
                  securities laws (collectively, the "UNDERWRITER GROUP") for
                  any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (the "LIABILITIES")
                  to which Lender, the Lender Group or the Underwriter Group may
                  become subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or are
                  based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of
                  any material fact contained in the applicable portions of such
                  sections described in Section 12.10(b)(i) expressly applicable
                  and relating to the Obligors, any Subsidiary of the Obligors,
                  the Individual Properties or the Loan, or arise out of or are
                  based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
                  material fact required to be stated in the applicable portions
                  of such sections or necessary in order to make the statements
                  in the applicable portions of such sections or in light of the
                  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
                  provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to
                  indemnify Lender for any Liabilities relating to untrue
                  statements or omissions which Borrower identifies to Lender in
                  writing at the time of Borrower's examination of the
                  Registration Statement; and

                           (iii) agreeing to reimburse the Lender, the Lender
                  Group and the Underwriter Group for any legal or other
                  expenses reasonably incurred by such Persons in connection
                  with investigating or defending the Liabilities. Borrower's




                                      111
<PAGE>

                  Liability under clauses (i), (ii) above and this clause (iii)
                  shall be limited to Liabilities arising out of or based upon
                  any such untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance
                  upon and in conformity with information prepared and furnished
                  to Lender by any Obligor pursuant to provisions of Sections
                  12.08, 12.09, and 12.10 hereof. This indemnity agreement will
                  be in addition to any liability which Borrower may otherwise
                  have.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
         Section 12.10 of notice of the commencement of any action, such
         indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
         against the indemnifying party under this Section 12.10, notify the
         indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the
         omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the
         indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may
         have to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that
         failure to notify causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the
         event that any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it
         notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
         indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with any other
         indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it
         (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified
         party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
         indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
         satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice from the
         indemnifying party to such indemnified party under this Section 12.10,
         the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any legal or other
         expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection
         with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation;
         provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both
         the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified
         party shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal defenses
         available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different
         from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the
         indemnified party or parties shall have the right, following notice to
         and consultation with Borrower, to select separate counsel to assert
         such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such
         action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties at the expense of
         the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for
         the expenses of more than one separate counsel unless an indemnified
         party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
         available to it that are different from or additional to those
         available to another indemnified party.

                  (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
         circumstances in which the indemnity provided for in this Section 12.10
         is for any reason held to be unenforceable by an indemnified party in
         respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in
         respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be
         indemnifiable under this Section 12.10 the indemnifying party shall
         contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
         result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in
         respect thereof); provided, however, that no person guilty of
         fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
         the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
         who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining
         the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are
         entitled, the following factors shall be considered: (i) the Lender
         Group's and Borrower's relative knowledge and access to information
         concerning the




                                      112
<PAGE>

         matter with respect to which claim was asserted; (ii) the opportunity
         to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and (iii) any other
         equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Lender and
         Borrower hereby agree that it may not be equitable if the amount of
         such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation.

                  (e) Rating Surveillance. Lender may retain the Rating Agencies
         to provide rating surveillance services on any certificates issued in a
         Securitization.

                  12.11 Retention of Servicer. Lender reserves the right to
retain a servicer to act as its agent hereunder with such powers as are
specifically delegated to the servicer by Lender, whether pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, the Mortgage or otherwise, together with such other powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. In no event shall any Obligor be required to
pay any servicer fees, securitization trustee fees or other securitization
administrative expenses except as may be expressly provided in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall pay any reasonable fees and
expenses of the servicer in connection with a prepayment, release of an
Individual Property, assumption or modification of the Loan, enforcement of the
Loan Documents or any other amounts which Borrower may be obligated to pay
pursuant to the Loan Documents.

                  12.12 Survival. The obligations of Borrower under Sections
5.03, 12.04, and 12.10 the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under
Section 6.03 shall survive the repayment of the Loan the expiration or
termination of the Lender's obligation to advance and the termination of this
Agreement or any provision hereof and, in the case of Lender that may assign any
interest in the Loan hereunder, shall survive the making of such assignment,
notwithstanding that such assigning Lender may cease to be a "Lender" hereunder.
In addition, each representation and warranty made, or deemed to be made by a
notice of any extension of credit, herein or pursuant hereto shall survive the
making of such representation and warranty, and Lender shall not be deemed to
have waived, by reason of making any extension of credit hereunder, any Default
that may arise by reason of such representation or warranty proving to have been
false or misleading, notwithstanding that Lender may have had notice or
knowledge or reason to believe that such representation or warranty was false or
misleading at the time such extension of credit was made.

                  12.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by
signing any such counterpart.

                  12.14 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.

                  (a) Governing Law. This Agreement and the Note shall be
         governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of
         New York.

                  (b) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Obligor hereby
         irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property,
         to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of
         New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District
         Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court
         from




                                      113
<PAGE>

         any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
         this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and
         each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may
         be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
         permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
         agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
         conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
         judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
         Agreement shall affect any right that Lender may otherwise have to
         bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against such
         Obligor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c) Waiver of Venue. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and
         unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
         effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
         the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
         relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of
         this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to
         the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
         forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
         court.

                  (d) Service of Process. Each party to this Agreement
         irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for
         notices in Section 12.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the
         right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
         manner permitted by law.

                  12.15 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE OBLIGORS AND LENDER
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

                  12.16 Captions. The table of contents and captions and section
headings appearing herein are included solely for convenience of reference and

Agreement.

                  12.17 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.

                  (a) Borrower acknowledges that from time to time financial
         advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or
         provided to Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries (in connection
         with this Agreement or otherwise) by Lender or by one or more
         subsidiaries or affiliates of Lender and Borrower hereby authorizes
         Lender to share any information delivered to Lender by Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the
         decision of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such
         subsidiary or affiliate, it being understood that any such subsidiary
         or affiliate receiving such information shall be bound by the
         provisions of paragraph (b) below as if it were a Lender hereunder.
         Such authorization and binding effect shall survive the repayment of
         the Loan.



                                      114
<PAGE>

                  (b) Lender agrees (on behalf of itself and each of its
         affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives) to use
         reasonable precautions to keep confidential, in accordance with its
         customary procedures for handling confidential information of the same
         nature and in accordance with safe and sound lending practices and
         shall not use same for any purpose other than in connection with this
         Agreement or as permitted below or elsewhere in this Section 12, any
         non-public information supplied to it by Borrower pursuant to this
         Agreement, provided that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of
         any such information (i) after such information shall have become
         public (other than through a violation of this Section 12.17), (ii) to
         the extent required by applicable law or judicial process, (iii) to
         counsel for the Lender, (iv) to bank examiners (or any other regulatory
         authority having jurisdiction over any Lender), or to auditors,
         accountants or advisors, (v) to the Lender, (vi) in connection with any
         litigation to which the Lender or another Indemnified Party is a party,
         or in connection with the enforcement of rights or remedies hereunder
         or under any other Loan Document, (vii) to a subsidiary or affiliate of
         such Lender as provided in paragraph (a) above, (viii) to any rating
         agency or insurer, or (ix) in connection with a Securitization so long
         as any assignee, pledgee, transferor, servicer, fiscal agent of
         transferee or participant (or prospective assignee, pledgee,
         transferor, servicer, fiscal agent of transferee or participant) is
         advised of the confidential nature of the items in question. The
         obligations of Lender under this Section 12.17 shall supersede and
         replace the obligations of such Lender under any confidentiality
         agreement, if any. The foregoing covenants may be enforced by Borrower
         by obtaining injunctive or specific relief from a court of competent
         jurisdiction, without the necessity of posting bond or proving lack of
         adequate remedy at law, such remedies to be cumulative and not
         exclusive of any other remedies available to Borrower at law or in
         equity.

                  12.18 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "CHARGES"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM RATE") which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section 12.18 shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate to the date of repayment, shall
