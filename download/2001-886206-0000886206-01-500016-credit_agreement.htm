case may be, for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.  Each Lender and the LC Issuer may, by written notice to the Agent and

the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date

the Facility Termination Date upon the request of the Borrower; provided that immediately after each such Facility LC is issued or
Modified, (i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding LC Obligations shall not exceed the lesser of:  (a) $5,000,000, and (b) the
Collateral Value of the Borrowing Base minus the amount of all Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans outstanding, and (ii) the
Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitment.  No Facility LC shall
have an expiry date later than the earlier of (x) the fifth Business Day prior to the Facility Termination Date and (y) one year
after its issuance.  Under the Existing Credit Agreement, Zions, as the "LC Issuer" (as defined therein) issued the Existing Letters
of Credit.  Effective as of the Effective Date, the Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed "Facility LCs for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  All issuance fees paid to the "Lenders" under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit

the proposed date of issuance (or Modification) and the expiry date of such Facility LC, and describing the proposed terms of such
Facility LC and the nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby.  Upon receipt of such notice, the LC Issuer shall
promptly notify the Agent, and the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender, of the contents thereof and of the amount of such
Lender's participation in such proposed Facility LC.  The issuance or Modification by the LC Issuer of any Facility LC shall, in
addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Article IV (the satisfaction of which the LC Issuer shall have no duty to
ascertain), be subject to the conditions precedent that such Facility LC shall be satisfactory to the LC Issuer and that the Borrower
shall have executed and delivered such application agreement and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to such Facility
LC as the LC Issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a "Facility LC Application").  In the event of any conflict between the

standby Facility LC, such fee to be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter and on the Facility
Termination Date, and (ii) with respect to each commercial Facility LC, a one-time letter of credit fee in an amount equal to such
percentage of the initial stated amount (or, with respect to a Modification of any such commercial Facility LC which increases the
stated amount thereof, such increase in the stated amount) as the LC Issuer may require consistent with its customary practices for
similar letters of credit, such fee to be payable on the date of such issuance or increase (each such fee described in this sentence
an "LC Fee").  The Borrower shall also pay to the LC Issuer for its own account (x) at the time of issuance of each Facility LC, a
fronting fee equal to 0.15% of the stated amount of such Facility LC, and (y) documentary and processing charges in connection with

Date").  The responsibility of the LC Issuer to the Borrower and each Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including
each demand for payment) delivered under each Facility LC in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in all material
respects with such Facility LC.  The LC Issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance and administration of the
Facility LCs as it does with respect to letters of credit in which no participations are granted, it being understood that in the
absence of any gross negligence or willful misconduct by the LC Issuer, each Lender shall be unconditionally and irrevocably liable
without regard to the occurrence of any Default or any condition precedent whatsoever, to reimburse the LC Issuer on demand for (i)
such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of each payment made by the LC Issuer under each Facility LC to the extent such amount is
not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19.6 below, plus (ii) interest on the foregoing amount to be reimbursed by such
Lender, for each day from the date of the LC Issuer's demand for such reimbursement (or, if such demand is made after 11:00 a.m.
(Chicago time) on such date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date on which such Lender pays the amount to be reimbursed
by it, at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate
of interest equal to the rate applicable to Floating Rate Loans.</font></p>

hereby be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower or such Lender to
the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the LC Issuer in determining whether
a request presented under any Facility LC issued by it complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (ii) the LC Issuer's failure to
pay under any Facility LC issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of
such Facility LC.  All such amounts paid by the LC Issuer and remaining unpaid by the Borrower shall bear interest, payable on
demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to (x) the rate applicable to Floating Rate Loans for such day if such day
falls on or before the applicable LC Payment Date and (y) the sum of 2% plus the rate applicable to Floating Rate Loans for such day
if such day falls after such LC Payment Date.  The LC Issuer will pay to each Lender ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share
all amounts received by it from the Borrower for application in payment, in whole or in part, of the Reimbursement Obligation in
respect of any Facility LC issued by the LC Issuer, but only to the extent such Lender has made payment to the LC Issuer in respect
of such Facility LC pursuant to Section 2.19.5.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including without limitation
the submission of a Borrowing Notice in compliance with Section 2.8 and the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set
forth in Article IV), the Borrower may request a Revolving Loan hereunder for the purpose of satisfying any Reimbursement

any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had
against the LC Issuer, any Lender or any beneficiary of a Facility LC.  The Borrower further agrees with the LC Issuer and the
Lenders that the LC Issuer and the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligation in respect of
any Facility LC shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements
thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute
between or among the Borrower, any of its Affiliates, the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing institution or other party
to whom any Facility LC may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower or of any of its Affiliates against
the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any such transferee.  The LC Issuer shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption
or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC.
The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the LC Issuer or any Lender under or in connection with each Facility LC and
the related drafts and documents, if done without gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and
shall not put the LC Issuer or any Lender under any liability to the Borrower.  Nothing in this Section 2.19.7 is intended to limit
the right of the Borrower to make a claim against the LC Issuer for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of

teletype message, statement, order or other document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected
by the LC Issuer.  The LC Issuer shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it
shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.19, the LC Issuer shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the
Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any
future holders of a participation in any Facility LC.</font></p>

transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Facility LC or any actual or proposed use of any Facility LC, including, without
limitation, any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which the LC Issuer may incur by reason of or in connection
with (i) the failure of any other Lender to fulfill or comply with its obligations to the LC Issuer hereunder (but nothing herein
contained shall affect any rights the Borrower may have against any defaulting Lender) or (ii) by reason of or on account of the LC
Issuer issuing any Facility LC which specifies that the term "Beneficiary" included therein includes any successor by operation of
law of the named Beneficiary, but which Facility LC does not require that any drawing by any such successor Beneficiary be
accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory to the LC Issuer, evidencing the appointment of such successor Beneficiary;
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, the LC Issuer or the Agent for any claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the
LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (y) the LC
Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and

expected to be maintained by such Lender or the LC Issuer, any Lending Installation of such Lender or the LC Issuer or any
corporation controlling such Lender or the LC Issuer  is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand by such

return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender or the LC Issuer reasonably determines is attributable to this
Agreement, its Loans, its Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure, its Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan outstanding, its Revolving
Credit Commitment to make Loans or to issue or participate in Facility LCs, as the case may be, hereunder (after taking into account
such Lender's or the LC Issuer's policies as to capital adequacy).  "Change" means (i) any change after the date of this Agreement in
the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines, or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this Agreement
which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or the LC Issuer or any Lending Installation
or any corporation controlling any Lender or the LC Issuer.  "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based capital
guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement, including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding
capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle
Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital
Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.</FONT></P>

the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Loans are not available
or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar
Loans, then the Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Loans and require any affected Eurodollar Loans to be repaid or
converted to Floating Rate Loans, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.</FONT></P>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Existence and Standing</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership (in the case of
Subsidiaries only) or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and
(to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Authorization and Validity</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower and each of the Guarantors has the power and authority and legal right to
execute and deliver the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder.  The execution and delivery
by the Borrower and each of the Guarantors of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the performance of its obligations
thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which such Person is a party
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of such Person enforceable against such Person in accordance with their terms, except
as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> No Conflict; Government Consent</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower nor any of the Guarantors of
the Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the
provisions thereof will violate (i) to the best of the Borrower's knowledge in the orderly conduct of its business, any law, rule,
regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the
Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles
or certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating or other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of
any indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or
its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of
any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or
agreement.  No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration
with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which
has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under this Agreement, the payment

 <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Financial Statements; Projections</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The February 24, 2001 consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to the Lenders were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect
on the date such statements were prepared and fairly present the consolidated financial condition and operations of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results of their operations for the period then ended.  The projections dated July
5, 2001 prepared by the Borrower and delivered pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement remain accurate and complete in all material
respects and the Borrower is not aware of any facts and circumstances arising since the date of such projections which could
reasonably be expected to affect the information set forth therein in any material respect.</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>  Material Adverse Change</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since February 24, 2001 there has been no change in the business, Property, prospects,
 condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Taxes</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the best of the Borrower's knowledge in the orderly conduct of its business, the Borrower and its
 Subsidiaries have filed all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid
all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except such
taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with Agreement
Accounting Principles and as to which no Lien exists.  The United States income tax returns of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
been audited by the Internal Revenue Service through the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994.  No tax liens have been filed and no
claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes.  The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are adequate.</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Litigation and Contingent Obligations</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as set forth on Schedule 5.7, there is no litigation, arbitration,
governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to the knowledge of the chief executive officer of the Borrower or any
of the Authorized Officers, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of any Credit Extension.  Other than
any liability incident to any litigation, arbitration or proceeding which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has any material Contingent Obligations not provided for or disclosed in the
financial statements referred to in Section 5.4.</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Subsidiaries</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule 5.8 contains an accurate list of all Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of the date of this
Agreement, setting forth their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their respective capital stock or other
ownership interests owned by the Borrower or other Subsidiaries.  All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other
ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the extent such concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership
interests) duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.
</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>There are no Unfunded Liabilities under any Single Employer Plans</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Borrower nor any other
member of the Controlled Group has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur, any withdrawal liability to Multiemployer Plans.
Each Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and regulations, no Reportable Event has occurred
with respect to any Plan, neither the Borrower nor any other member of the Controlled Group has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated
steps to do so, and no steps have been taken to reorganize or terminate any Plan.
</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Accuracy of Information</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;No information, exhibit or report furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to
the Agent or to any Lender in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan Documents contained any material
misstatement of fact or omitted to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading (other than such as have been expressly corrected in writing prior to the Effective Date).
</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Regulation U</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) constitutes less than 25% of the value of those assets of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other restriction hereunder.
</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

in its individual capacity).</font></p>

acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders, and such
instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.  The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.
The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may
incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.</font></p>

10.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in
proportion to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments
immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to
reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders,
in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions
contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection
with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of
the Loan Documents or of any such other documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent
any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall,
notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof.  The
obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.</font></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

10.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Notice of Default</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or
Unmatured Default hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement
describing such Default or Unmatured Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default".  In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.</font></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

10.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Rights as a Lender</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder
and under any other Loan Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context otherwise
indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity.  The Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby
from engaging with any other Person.</font></p>

10.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Lender Credit Decision</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent,
the Arranger or any other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.</font></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

10.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Successor Agent</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower,
such resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent has been appointed, forty-five
days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its intention to resign.  The Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by
written notice received by the Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the Required
Lenders.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and
the Lenders, a successor Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after
the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and
the Lenders, a successor Agent.  Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower
or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder.  If the Agent has resigned or
been removed and no successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the
Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal
directly with the Lenders.  No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has accepted the
appointment.  Any such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent.  Upon the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents.  After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of an Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the Agent
assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this
Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.</font></p>

10.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Agent and Arranger Fees</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent and the Arranger, for their respective accounts,
the fees agreed to by the Borrower, the Agent and the Arranger pursuant to those certain letter agreements dated June 15, 2001 or as
otherwise agreed from time to time.</font></p>

10.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Delegation to Affiliates</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower and the Lenders agree that the Agent may delegate any of its duties under
this Agreement to any of its Affiliates.  Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents and employees) which
performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.</font></p>

11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Setoff</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower
becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether
provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the
Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due; provided, however, that so
long as any Obligations are secured by Real Property, no Lender will exercise any right of offset against deposits of the Borrower or
any Guarantor maintained with it without prior notice to and the consent of the Agent.</font></p>

(other than payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any other
Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding Combined Credit Exposure with
interest accrued and unpaid thereon held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its Pro Rata Share of
the Aggregate Combined Outstanding Credit Exposure.  If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be
subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to
setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such
collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans.  In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate
further adjustments shall be made.</font></p>

12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Successors and Assigns</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Borrower and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the Borrower shall not have the
right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section 12.1 relates only to absolute
assignments and does not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, (x) any pledge or
assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in
the case of a Lender which is a fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note
to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment creating a security
interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with
the provisions of Section 12.3.  The Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for
all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3; provided, however, that the Agent may in its discretion
(but shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments
relating to such Loan or Note to another Person.  Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such
assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who
at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note
has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

       12.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Permitted Participants; Effect</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of
its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or
more banks or other entities (&#147;Participants&#148;) participating interests
in any Outstanding Combined Credit Exposure of such Lender, any Note held by
such Lender, any Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender or any other
interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale
by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender&#146;s
obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Outstanding Combined
Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for
all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under
this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such
participating interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender&#146;s
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.</font></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       12.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Voting Rights</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve,
without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or
waiver with respect to any Credit Extension or the Revolving Credit Commitment
in which such Participant has an interest which would require consent of all of
the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 or of any other Loan Document. </font></p>

       12.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Benefit of Setoff</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same
extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it
as a Lender under the Loan Documents, <I>provided</I> that each Lender shall
retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount
of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share
with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff
provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received
pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in
accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender. </font></p>

       12.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Permitted Assignments</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one or
more banks or other entities (&#147;Purchasers&#148;) all or any part of its
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be
substantially in the form of <B>Exhibit I</B> or in such other form as may be
agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the Borrower, the Agent and the
LC Issuer shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective with
respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof;
<I>provided, however,</I> that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the
consent of the Borrower shall not be required. Such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each such assignment with respect to a
Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof shall (unless each of
the Borrower, the Agent and the LC Issuer otherwise consents) be in an amount
not less than the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or (ii) the remaining amount of the
assigning Lender&#146;s Commitment (calculated as at the date of such
assignment) or outstanding Loans (if the applicable Commitment has been
terminated) and shall be pro rata as to the Revolving Loans, Facility LCs and
the Term Loan. </font></p>

       12.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Effect; Effective Date</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of an assignment,
together with any consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii) payment of a
$3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is
waived by the Agent), such assignment shall become effective on the effective
date specified in such assignment. The assignment shall contain a representation
by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the
purchase of the Outstanding Combined Credit Exposure, the Revolving Credit
Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes
&#147;plan assets&#148; as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests
of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be &#147;plan
assets&#148; under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment,
such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and
any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have
all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same
extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further consent or action
by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent shall be required to release the
transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Revolving
Credit Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser. Upon the consummation of
any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor
Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall, if the transferor Lender or the
Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate
arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued
to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes,
are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their
respective Revolving Credit Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such
assignment. </font></p>

<U>Dissemination of Information</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or
any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee
any and all information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including

 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Until there shall have occurred and be continuing a Default, Borrower shall be entitled to vote or consent
with respect to the Pledged Shares in any manner not inconsistent with this Borrower Security Agreement or any document or instrument
delivered or to be delivered pursuant to or in connection with any thereof and to receive all dividends paid with respect to the
Pledged Shares.  If there shall have occurred and be continuing a Default and the Agent shall have notified Borrower that the Agent
desires to exercise its proxy rights with respect to all or a portion of the Pledged Shares, Borrower hereby grants to the Agent an
irrevocable proxy for the Pledged Shares pursuant to which proxy the Agent shall be entitled to vote or consent, in its discretion,
and in such event Borrower agrees to deliver to the Agent such further evidence of the grant of such proxy as the Agent may request.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, Borrower, as record and
beneficial owner of the Pledged Shares, shall receive or shall become entitled to receive, any dividend or any other distribution
whether in securities or property by way of stock split, spin-off, split-up or reclassification, combination of shares or the like,
or in case of any reorganization, consolidation or merger, and Borrower, as record and beneficial owner of the Pledged Shares, shall
thereby be entitled to receive securities or property in respect of such Pledged Shares, then and in each such case, Borrower shall
deliver to the Agent and the Agent shall be entitled to receive and retain all such securities or property as part of the Pledged
Shares as security for the payment and performance of the Obligations; provided, however, that until there shall have occurred a
Default, Borrower shall be entitled to retain any cash dividends paid on account of the Pledged Shares.</FONT></P>

 (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the occurrence of a Default, the Agent is authorized to sell the Pledged Shares and, at any such sale
of any of the Pledged Shares, if it deems it advisable to do so, to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons or
entities who (1) will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the
distribution or sale of any of the Pledged Shares; and (2) satisfy the offeree and purchaser requirements for a valid private
placement transaction under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and under Securities and Exchange
Commission Release Nos. 33-6383; 34-18524; 35-22407; 39-700; IC-12264; AS-306, or under any similar statute, rule or regulation.
Borrower agrees that disposition of the Pledged Shares pursuant to any private sale made as provided above may be at prices and on
other terms less favorable than if the Pledged Shares were sold at public sale, and that the Agent has no obligation to delay the
sale of any Pledged Shares for public sale under the Act.  Borrower agrees that a private sale or sales made under the foregoing
circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.  In the event that the Agent elects to sell the
Pledged Shares, or part of them, and there is a public market for the Pledged Shares, in a public sale Borrower shall use its best
efforts to register and qualify the Pledged Shares, or applicable part thereof, under the Act and all state Blue Sky or securities
laws required by the proposed terms of sale and all expenses thereof shall be payable by Borrower, including, but not limited to, all
costs of (i) registration or qualification of, under the Act or any state Blue Sky or securities laws or pursuant to any applicable
rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto, any Pledged Shares, and (ii) sale of such Pledged Shares, including, but not limited to,
brokers' or underwriters' commissions, fees or discounts, accounting and legal fees, costs of printing and other expenses of transfer
and sale.</FONT></P>

or authority should be necessary to effectuate any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Shares, or any part thereof, Borrower
will execute such applications and other instruments as may be required in connection with securing any such consent, approval or
authorization, and will otherwise use its best efforts to secure the same.</FONT></P>

respect to the Pledged Shares.  If there shall have occurred and be continuing a Guarantor Default and the Agent shall have notified
Guarantor that the Agent desires to exercise its proxy rights with respect to all or a portion of the Pledged Shares, Guarantor
hereby grants to the Agent an irrevocable proxy for the Pledged Shares pursuant to which proxy the Agent shall be entitled to vote or

proxy as the Agent may request.</FONT></P>

or in case of any reorganization, consolidation or merger, and Guarantor, as record and beneficial owner of the Pledged Shares, shall
thereby be entitled to receive securities or property in respect of such Pledged Shares, then and in each such case, Guarantor shall
deliver to the Agent and the Agent shall be entitled to receive and retain all such securities or property as part of the Pledged
Shares as security for the payment and performance of the Obligations; provided, however, that until there shall have occurred a

view to the distribution or sale of any of the Pledged Shares; and (2) satisfy the offeree and purchaser requirements for a valid
private placement transaction under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and under Securities and

regulation. Guarantor agrees that disposition of the Pledged Shares pursuant to any private sale made as provided above may be at
prices and on other terms less favorable than if the Pledged Shares were sold at public sale, and that the Agent has no obligation to
delay the sale of any Pledged Shares for public sale under the Act.  Guarantor agrees that a private sale or sales made under the
foregoing circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.  In the event that the Agent elects to
sell the Pledged Shares, or part of them, and there is a public market for the Pledged Shares, in a public sale Guarantor shall use
its best efforts to register and qualify the Pledged Shares, or applicable part thereof, under the Act and all state Blue Sky or
securities laws required by the proposed terms of sale and all expenses thereof shall be payable by Guarantor, including, but not
limited to, all costs of (i) registration or qualification of, under the Act or any state Blue Sky or securities laws or pursuant to
any applicable rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto, any Pledged Shares, and (ii) sale of such Pledged Shares, including, but

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the payment when due,
upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations, including in all
cases, whether heretofore, now, or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether
voluntary or involuntary and however arising, absolute or contingent, liquidated
or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, whether or not such Obligations are
from time to time reduced, or extinguished and thereafter increased or incurred,
whether the Company may be liable individually or jointly with others, whether
or not recovery upon such Obligations may be or hereafter become barred by any
statute of limitations, and whether or not such Obligations may be or hereafter
become otherwise unenforceable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the payment of the
Obligations, whether or not due or payable by the Company, upon: (a)&#160;the
dissolution, insolvency or business failure of, or any assignment for benefit of
creditors by, or commencement of any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
moratorium or other debtor relief proceedings by or against, either the Company
or Guarantor, or (b)&#160;the appointment of a receiver for, or the attachment,
restraint of or making or levying of any order of court or legal process

<PAGE>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The liability of Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any
security for or other guaranty of the Obligations, whether executed by Guarantor
or by any other party, and the liability of Guarantor hereunder is not affected
or impaired by (a)&#160;any direction of application of payment by the Company
or by any other party, or (b)&#160;any other guaranty, undertaking or maximum
liability of Guarantor or of any other party as to the Obligations, or
(c)&#160;any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or
undertaking, or (d)&#160;any revocation or release of any obligations of any
other guarantor of the Obligations, or (e)&#160;any dissolution, termination or
increase, decrease or change in personnel of Guarantor, or (f)&#160;any payment
made to the Agent or any Credit Provider on the Obligations which the Agent or
any Credit Provider repays to the Company pursuant to court order in any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief
proceeding, and Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or modification of
Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The obligations of Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of
the Company with respect to the Obligations, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor whether or not action is brought
against the Company and whether or not the Company be joined in any such action
or actions. Guarantor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the
enforcement thereof. Any payment by the Company or other circumstance which
operates to toll any statute of limitations as to the Company shall operate to
toll the statute of limitations as to Guarantor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All payments made by Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be made without set-off
or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deductions for any present or
future taxes, fees, withholdings or conditions of any nature
(&#147;Taxes&#148;). Guarantor shall pay any such Taxes, including Taxes on any
amounts so paid, and will promptly furnish any Credit Provider copies of any tax
receipts or such other evidence of payment as such Credit Provider may require. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Guarantor authorizes the Agent and Credit Providers (whether or not after
termination of this Guaranty), without notice or demand (except as shall be
required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or
impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to (a)&#160;renew,
compromise, extend, increase, accelerate or otherwise change the time for
payment of, or otherwise change the terms of Obligations or any part thereof,
including increase or decrease of the rate of interest thereon; (b)&#160;take
and hold security for the payment of this Guaranty or the Obligations and
exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security; (c)&#160;apply such
security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Agent and Credit
Providers in their discretion may determine; and (d)&#160;release or substitute
any one or more endorsers, guarantors, the Company or other obligors. The Agent
and Credit Providers may, without notice to or the further consent of the
Company or Guarantor, assign this Guaranty in whole or in part to any person
acquiring an interest in the Obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is not necessary for the Agent or any Credit Provider to inquire into the
capacity or power of the Company or the officers acting or purporting to act on
their behalf, and Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed
exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Guarantor waives any right to require the Agent or any Credit Provider to
(a)&#160;proceed against the Company or any other party; (b)&#160;proceed
against or exhaust any security held from the Company; or (c)&#160;pursue any
other remedy whatsoever. Guarantor waives any personal defense based on or
arising out of any personal defense of the Company other than payment in full of
the Obligations, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising
out of the disability of either the Company, or the unenforceability of the
Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause
of the liability of the Company other than payment in full of the Obligations.
The Agent and Credit Providers may, at their election, foreclose on any security
held for the Obligations by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, or
exercise any other right or remedy they may have against the Company, or any
security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of Guarantor
hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been paid. Guarantor waives
all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies, even though that
election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security
for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed Guarantor&#146;s rights of
subrogation and reimbursement against the principal. </FONT></P>
<PAGE>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Guarantor hereby waives any claim or other rights which Guarantor may now have
or may hereafter acquire against the Company or any other guarantor of all or
any of the Obligations that arise from the existence or performance of
Guarantor&#146;s obligations under this Guaranty or any other of the Loan
Documents (all such claims and rights being referred to as the
&#147;Guarantor&#146;s Conditional Rights&#148;), including, without limitation,
any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, or
indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy which the Agent
or any Credit Provider has against the Company or any collateral which the Agent
or any Credit Provider now has or hereafter acquires for the Obligations,
whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract,
statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including,
without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner,

notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any amount shall be paid to Guarantor
on account of Guarantor&#146;s Conditional Rights and either (a) such amount is
paid to Guarantor at any time when the Obligations shall not have been paid or
performed in full, or (b) regardless of when such amount is paid to Guarantor
any payment made by the Company to the Agent or any Credit Provider is at any

credited and applied upon the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such

enforceable, Guarantor agrees that until such time as the Obligations have been
paid and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any
payment made by the Company or Guarantor may be determined to be a preferential

shall be subordinate to the Credit Providers&#146; right to full payment and
performance of the Obligations and Guarantor shall not seek to enforce
Guarantor&#146;s Conditional Rights during such period. </FONT></P>

Gentlemen/Ladies:</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are counsel for FRANKLIN COVEY CO., a Utah corporation (the
&#147;Borrower&#148;), and each of the Initial Guarantors under (and as the term
&#147;Initial Guarantors&#148; and other capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined herein are defined in) that certain Credit Agreement dated as
of July 10, 2001 among the Borrower, Bank One, NA (&#147;Bank One&#148;) and the
other Lenders from time to time party thereto, Bank One, as the Agent for the
Lenders, Bank One, as the LC Issuer, and Zions First National Bank, as the Swing
Line Lender, and have represented the Borrower and the Initial Guarantors
(collectively and severally, the &#147;Credit Parties&#148;) in connection with
its execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents
and providing for Revolving Loans and Facility LCs in an aggregate principal
amount not exceeding $70,000,000 at any one time outstanding and a Term Loan in
an amount not to exceed $30,000,000. All capitalized terms used in this opinion
and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in
the Agreement. </font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We
have examined each of the Credit Parties&#146; **[describe constitutive
documents of each of the Credit Parties and appropriate evidence of authority to
enter into the transaction]**, the Loan Documents and such other matters of fact
and law which we deem necessary in order to render this opinion. Based upon the
foregoing, it is our opinion that: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
l.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or
limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the
case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such
entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is conducted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The execution and delivery by each of the Credit Parties of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the
performance by such Credit Party of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings on the part
of such Credit Party and will not:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  require any consent of such Credit Party's shareholders or members (other than any such consent as has
already been given and remains in full force and effect);</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership
agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating or other management agreement,
as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default
thereunder; or</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or
a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any indenture, instrument or agreement binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Liens created in favor of the Agent for the benefit of the Credit Providers under the Loan Documents).</FONT></P>
<PAGE>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Loan Documents to which each of the Credit Parties is a party have been duly
executed and delivered by such Credit Party and constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of such Credit Party enforceable against such Credit Party
in accordance with their terms except to the extent the enforcement thereof may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors&#146; rights generally and subject also to the availability of
equitable remedies if equitable remedies are sought. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or
inquiry pending or, to the best of our knowledge after due inquiry, threatened
against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation
of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action
in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision
thereof, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
is required to be obtained by any of the Credit Parties in connection with the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents to which it is party, the
borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the payment and performance by such
Credit Party of its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is party,
or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan
Documents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The provisions of the Loan Documents are sufficient to create in favor of the
Agent for the benefit of the Credit Providers, a security interest in all right,
title and interest of the Credit Parties executing such Loan Documents in those
items and types of collateral described in the Loan Documents in which a
security interest may be created under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code
as in effect on the date hereof in all applicable jurisdictions. Financing
statements on Form UCC-1&#145;s have been duly executed by each of the Credit
Parties and have been duly filed in each filing office indicated in Exhibit A
hereto under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in each state in which said
filing offices are located. The description of the collateral set forth in said
financing statements is sufficient to perfect a security interest in the items
and types of collateral described therein in which a security interest may be
perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial
Code as in effect in such states. Such filings are sufficient to perfect the
security interest created by the Loan Documents in all right, title and interest
of the Credit Parties in those items and types of collateral described in the
Loan Documents in which a security interest may be perfected by the filing of a
financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code in such states, except
that we express no opinion as to personal property affixed to real property in
such manner as to become a fixture under the laws of any state in which the
collateral may be located and we call your attention to the fact that the
security interest granted under the Loan Documents in certain of such collateral
may not be perfected by filing financing statements under the Uniform Commercial
Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opinion may be relied upon by the Agent,
the LC Issuer, the Swing Line Lender, the Lenders and their participants,
assignees and other transferees. </FONT></P>

Purchase Commitments

At August 31, 2000,  the Company had  contracts  with various  builders,  totaling $3.2 million,  for  construction  related to new and
remodeled retail stores.

The Company also has various  purchase  commitments  for  materials,  supplies,  and other items  incident to the  ordinary  conduct of
business.  In aggregate, such commitments are immaterial to the Company's operations.

Pursuant to the EDS Information Technology Services Agreement (which encompasses the outsourcing of [1] Information Technology
Services; [2] Call Center Services, and [3] Distribution and Warehouse Services, including EDS' lease of approximately 406,000 square
feet of the Company's warehouse and distribution facilities) (the "IT Agreement") Franklin Covey has certain obligations related to
termination of the IT Agreement.   As to termination for convenience of either the Information Technology Services or the Call Center
Services, Franklin Covey and EDS have agreed to termination fees based on the year in which Franklin Covey terminates the IT
Agreement or any portion thereof.  However, in the event that Franklin Covey encounters a significant change in its business such
that Franklin Covey no longer requires the delivery of Distribution and Warehouse Services, EDS and Franklin Covey have agreed to
negotiate in good faith an alternate services agreement, for alternate services sufficient to replace, for EDS, service fees related
to the Distribution and Warehouse Services.  In the event that EDS and Franklin Covey are unable to negotiate an alternate services
agreement, EDS and Franklin Covey have agreed to negotiate a termination fee that covers EDS' unamortized costs and shutdown expenses
related to the Distribution and Warehouse Services and takes into account, among other factors, EDS' lost profits, and remaining
lease and sublease expenses for the Salt Lake City distribution facility.


Legal Matters

The Company is the subject of certain legal  actions,  which it considers  routine to its business  activities.  As of August 31, 2000,
management  believes that, after discussion with its legal counsel,  any potential liability to the Company under such actions will not
materially affect the Company's financial position or results of operations.


                           Management Common Stock Loan Program


During fiscal 2000, the Company announced the  implementation of an incentive-based  compensation  program that includes a loan program
from external  lenders to certain  managers for the purpose of  purchasing  shares of the  Company's  common  stock.  The program gives
management  of the Company the  opportunity  to purchase  shares of the  Company's  common  stock on the open  market,  and from shares
purchased by the Company,  by borrowing on a full-recourse  basis from the external  lenders.  The Company has facilitated the loans by
providing a  guarantee  to the  lenders.  The program  will total  approximately  $33.0  million  and the Company has  facilitated  the
purchase of open-market  shares to ensure  compliance with  appropriate SEC trading rules and  regulations.  As of August 31, 2000, the
Company had facilitated the purchase of 3,559,000 shares at a cost of $30.00 million for the loan program.
