demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans be
converted immediately to Base Rate Loans.

         (c)      The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders

of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Agent

         2.03     Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon notice to the
Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in
part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received
                                 --------
by the Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., Seattle time, (A) three Business Days
prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and (B) on the date
of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in
excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.
Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the
Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid. The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of
its receipt of each such notice, and of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due
and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate
Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any
additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment
                                        ------------
shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with Section 2.11.
                                                                ------------

         2.04     MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

         (a)      If, as of the date of the Agent's receipt of the As-Completed
Appraisal, the Outstanding Amount of all Loans exceeds 65% of the fair market
value of Fisher Plaza based solely on the income valuation method of appraisal
as set forth in the As-Completed Appraisal, then the Borrower shall promptly,
and in no event later than 15 days after the Agent's receipt of the
As-Completed Appraisal, prepay Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such
excess.

         (b)      If any Loan Party, Fisher Mills or Fisher Broadcasting shall
at any time or from time to time make or agree to make a Disposition, or shall
suffer an Event of Loss, in each case, other than in respect of Fisher Plaza,
then (i) the Borrower shall promptly notify the Agent of such proposed
Disposition or Event of Loss (including the amount of the estimated Net
Proceeds to be received by the such Loan Party in respect thereof) and (ii)
promptly upon, and in no event later than 30 days after, receipt by such Loan
Party of the Net Proceeds of such Disposition or Event of Loss, the Borrower
shall prepay Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of such Net
Proceeds; provided, however, that so long as no Default or Event of Default
          --------  -------
exists or would result therefrom, the Borrower may accept from and retain 50%
of the first $16,000,000 of the Net Proceeds of Dispositions and Events of Loss
received by any of the Loan Parties, and use such Net Proceeds to make capital
expenditures related to the completion of Fisher Plaza.

         (c)      If any Loan Party shall issue new debt (other than a borrowing
under the Fisher Communications Margin Loan Agreement or the Fisher
Communications Forward Sale Documents) or equity (including equity issued in
connection with the exercise of options rights), the Borrower shall promptly
notify the Agent of the estimated Net Issuance Proceeds of such issuance to be
received by such Loan Party in respect thereof. Promptly upon, and in no event
later than 30 days after, receipt by such Loan Party of Net Issuance Proceeds
of such issuance,

                                     19

<PAGE>

the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the amount
of such Net Issuance Proceeds; provided, however, that in the case of Net
                               --------  -------
Issuance Proceeds of equity issued in connection with the exercise of stock
options, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to
such Net Issuance Proceeds in arrears on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December.

(d) Any prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be applied first to any
                                     ------------
Base Rate Loans then outstanding and then to Eurodollar Rate Loans with the
shortest Interest Periods remaining. The Borrower shall pay, together with each
prepayment under this Section 2.04, accrued interest on the amount prepaid
                      ------------
together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each
                                                          ------------
such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with
Section 2.11.
------------

         2.05     Repayment of Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders
from the Net Proceeds of Dispositions and Events of Loss received from the Loan
Parties pursuant to Section 2.04(b), Loans in an aggregate amount of not less
                    ---------------
than $6,000,000 on or before December 31, 2002; provided, however, that if the
                                                --------  -------
Borrower fails to perform or observe any term, covenant or agreement contained
in Section 6.02(d), the aggregate amount of Loans to be repaid to the Lenders
   ---------------
pursuant to this Section on or before December 31, 2002 shall be not less than
$7,000,000. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the
aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding on such date.

         2.06     INTEREST.

         (a)      Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate
                              ----
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the
applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
                                                                     ----
Applicable Rate.

         (b)      While any Event of Default exists or after acceleration, the
Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding
Obligations at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Accrued and
unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest)
shall be due and payable upon demand.

         (c)      Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance
with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

         2.07     Upfront Fee; Arrangement and Agency Fees. The Borrower shall
pay (a) an upfront fee to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, (b) an
arrangement fee to the Arranger for the Arranger's own account, and (c) an
agency fee to the Agent for the Agent's own account, in the amounts and at the
times specified in the letter agreement, dated February 15, 2002 (the

                                     20

<PAGE>


"Fee Letter"), between the Borrower, the Arranger and the Agent. Such fees shall
 ----------
be fully earned when paid and shall be nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever.

         2.08     Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest on Base Rate Loans
shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, and the actual number of days elapsed. Computation of all other types of
interest and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days
and the actual number of days elapsed, which results in a higher yield to the
payee thereof than a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days. Interest shall
accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue
on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such
portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which
                 --------
it is made shall bear interest for one day.

         2.09     Evidence of Loans. The Loans made by each Lender shall be
evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by
the Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest
error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the
interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing
so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower
hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loans. In the event of
any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the
accounts and records of the Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and
records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the
request of any Lender made through the Agent, such Lender's Loans may be
evidenced by a Note, in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may
attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if
applicable), amount and maturity of the applicable Loans and payments with
respect thereto.

         2.10     PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

         (a)      All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders
to which such payment is owed, at the Agent's Office in Dollars and in
immediately available funds not later than 12:00 noon, Seattle time, on the
date specified herein. The Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its
applicable share as provided herein of such payment in like funds as received
by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the
Agent after 12:00 noon, Seattle time, shall be deemed received on the next
succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to
accrue.

         (b)       Subject to the definition of "Interest Period," if any
payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business
Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such
extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case
may be

         (c)      On each date when the payment of any principal, interest or
fees are due hereunder or under any Note, the Borrower agrees to maintain on
deposit in an ordinary checking account maintained by the Borrower with Bank of
America (as such account shall be designated

                                      21

<PAGE>

by the Borrower in a written notice to the Agent from time to time, the
"Borrower Account") an amount sufficient to pay such principal, interest or
 ----------------
fees in full. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent (i) to deduct
automatically all principal, interest or fees when due hereunder or under the
Notes from the Borrower Account, and (ii) if and to the extent any payment
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is not made when due, to deduct
automatically any such amount from any or all of the accounts of the Borrower
maintained with Bank of America. The Agent agrees to provide timely notice to
the Borrower of any automatic deduction made pursuant to this subsection (c).

         (d)      Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Agent prior
to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Agent hereunder,
that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such
payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may
be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in
reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled
thereto.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the
Agent in immediately available funds, then:

                 (i)      if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each
         Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Agent the portion of such
         assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately
         available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day
         from and including the date such amount was made available by the Agent
         to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent in
         immediately available funds, at the Federal Funds Rate from time to
         time in effect; and

                 (ii)     if any Lender  ailed to make such payment, such
         Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Agent the amount thereof
         in immediately available  funds, together with interest thereon
         for the period from the date such amount was made available by the
         Agent to the  Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the
         Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a rate per annum equal to the
                     -------------------
         Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays
         such amount to the Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
         Lender's Loan, as the case may be, included in the applicable
         Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the
         Agent's demand therefor, the Agent may make a demand therefor upon the
         Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Agent, together
         with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum
         equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing.
         Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its
         obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which
         the Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of
         any default by such Lender hereunder.

         A notice of the Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing
under this subsection (d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

         (e)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute
a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

         2.11     APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.

         (a)      Each payment under this Agreement or any Note shall be applied
(a) first, toward reasonable costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs and
    -----
amounts payable under Section 3) incurred by the Agent and each Lender, (b)
                      ---------
second, toward repayment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among
------
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and
fees then due to such parties, (c) third, if the aggregate outstanding
                                   -----
principal amount of the Loan of U.S. Bank exceeds $20,000,000, then toward
repayment of principal of U.S. Bank's Loan until the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of U.S. Bank's Loan equals $20,000,000, and (d) fourth, toward
                                                                 ------
repayment of principal of the Loans, 60% of such payment to the principal of
Bank of America's Loan and 40% of such payment to the principal of U.S. Bank's
Loan.

         (b)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the
contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, all amounts collected or received by the Agent or any Lender on
account of the Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the
Loan Documents or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered
as follows:

                 (i)      FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable costs and
         expenses (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Section 3)
                                                                      ---------
         incurred by the Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the
         Lenders under the Loan Documents and any protective advances made by
         the Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms
         of the Security Documents;

                 (ii)     SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent;

                 (iii)    THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable costs and
         expenses (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Section 3)
                                                                      ---------
         incurred by the Agent each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing
         its rights under the Loan Documents or otherwise with respect to the
         Obligations owing to such Lender;

                 (iv)     FOURTH, to payment of interest and fees then due under
         this Agreement, ratably among the Lenders in accordance with the
         amounts of interest and fees then due to each Lender;

                 (v)      FIFTH, if the aggregate  outstanding  principal amount
         of the Loan of U.S. Bank exceeds $20,000,000,  to payment of principal
         of U.S.  Bank's Loan until the aggregate  outstanding  principal
         amount of U.S. Bank's Loan equals $20,000,000;

                 (vi)     SIXTH,  ratably to payment of principal of the Loans,
         60% of such amount to the  principal of Bank of America's  Loan and 40%
         of such amount to the principal of U.S. Bank's Loan;

                 (vii)    SEVENTH, to payment of any amounts payable by any Loan

                                      23

<PAGE>

                 (viii)   EIGHTH, to all other Obligations and other obligations
         which shall have become due and payable under the Loan Documents or
         otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "SEVENTH"
         above; and

                 (ix)     NINTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to
         whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category.

         2.12     Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it
any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right
of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share
contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the
Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations
in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender
to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans pro rata with each of
them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
      --------  -------
thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender, such purchase shall to that
extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender
the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying
Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from
the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 10.09 with respect to
                                                -------------
such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Agent will keep records
(which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of
participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the
Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases
a participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase
have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other
communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the
Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were
the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

                                   SECTION 3.
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         3.01     TAXES.

         (a)      Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of
the Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of
and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and
all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the Agent and
                                      ---------
each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise
taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any
political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, is organized or

                                      24

<PAGE>

maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be
                                              -----
required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
under any Loan Document to the Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall
be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section), the Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall
make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Agent (which shall forward the same to such
Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof.

         (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes
or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan
Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").
                -----------

         (c)      If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes
or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to
the Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the Agent (for the
account of such Lender) or to such Lender, at the time interest is paid, such
additional amount that such Lender specifies is necessary to preserve the
after-tax yield (after factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or
measured by net income) such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been imposed.

         (d)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender for
(i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section) paid by the Agent and such Lender, (ii) amounts payable under
Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including penalties, interest and
--------------
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or
not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by
the relevant Governmental Authority.  Payment under this subsection (d) shall
be made within 30 days after the date the Lender or the Agent makes a demand
therefor.

         3.02     Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund
Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through
the Agent, any obligation of such Lender to continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or
to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until
such Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay
or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base
Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such
Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such
day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such

                                      25

<PAGE>

prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the
amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will
not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

         3.03     Inability to Determine Rates. If the Agent determines in
connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or
continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in
the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest
Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c)
the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan,
the Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and all Lenders. Thereafter, the
obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
suspended until the Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower may revoke any pending request for a conversion or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans.

         3.04     INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         (a)      If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's
compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as
the case may be), or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such
Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this
subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from
(i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes
                                      ------------
in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the
United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of
either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its
Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.04(c),
                                                               ---------------
then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand
to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as
will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

         (b)      If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law
regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has
the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's
obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to
capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time
to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent),
the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such reduction.

         (c)      The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender
shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets
consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
"Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves
allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good
faith, which

                                      26

<PAGE>

determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date
on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have
                                           --------
received at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Agent) of such
additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days
prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be
due and payable 15 days from receipt of such notice.

         3.05     Funding Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender
for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it
as a result of:

         (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any
Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or

         (b)      any failure by the  Borrower to prepay,  continue or convert
any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by
the Borrower;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such
Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
     ------------
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit
or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was
in fact so funded.

         3.06     Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation. A
certificate of the Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this
Section 3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
---------
hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining
such amount, the Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

         3.07     Survival.  All of the Borrower's  obligations  under this
Section 3  shall survive  termination of the Aggregate Commitments and
---------
repayment of all other Obligations.

                                   SECTION 4.

Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of any Loan Party in connection with any
Loan Document contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements

                                   THE AGENT

         9.01      Appointment and Authorization of Agent. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the Agent to take such action
on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan
Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan
Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities
shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist
against the Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other
implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
between independent contracting parties.

         9.02      Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents,
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and
other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital,

         9.04     RELIANCE BY AGENT.

         (a)      The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution,
representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or
conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), independent accountants
and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining
from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with
a request or consent of the Required Lenders or all the Lenders, if required
hereunder, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and participants. Where this
Agreement expressly permits or prohibits an action unless the Required Lenders
otherwise determine, the Agent shall, and in all other instances, the Agent
may, but shall not be required to, initiate any solicitation for the consent or
a vote of the Lenders.

         (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be
             ------------
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter either sent by the Agent to such Lender for consent,
approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to
or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender.

         9.05      Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,
except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees
required to be paid to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the
Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default." The Agent will notify the
Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Agent shall take such action
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be directed by the
Required Lenders in accordance with Section 8.02; provided, however, that
                                    ------------  --------  -------
unless and until the Agent has received any such direction, the Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem
advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

         9.06      Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Agent. Each
Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or
warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any
consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any
Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any
matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material
information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Agent that it
has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,

                                      50

<PAGE>

property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, the value of and title to any
Collateral, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this
Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the
other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent herein, the Agent shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or
any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any
Agent-Related Person.

         9.07      Indemnification of Agent. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand
each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any
Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro
rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that no Lender shall
                                        --------  -------
be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no
                                                     --------  -------
action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be
deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of
this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse
the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket
expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent in connection with
the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment
or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise)
of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred
to herein, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by
or on behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the
payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the Agent.

         9.08      Agent in its Individual Capacity. Bank of America and its
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of,
accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with
each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though Bank of
America were not the Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the
Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of
America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or
its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that
the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.
With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and
powers under this Agreement as any

                                      51

<PAGE>

other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the
Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.

         9.09      Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days'
notice to the Lenders. If the Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required
Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent
for the Lenders which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by
the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of
Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor administrative agent
from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor
administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor
administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor administrative
agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be
terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this Section 9 and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall inure to its
                   ---------     --------------     -----
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent
under this Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted
appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's
notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
the Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor agent as provided for above.

         9.10      Collateral Matters. The Agent is authorized on behalf of all
the Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from the
Lenders, from time to time to take any action with respect to any Collateral or
the Security Documents which may be necessary to perfect and maintain perfected
the security interest in and Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to the
Security Documents. The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Agent, at its option
and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Agent upon
any Collateral upon payment in full of all Loans and all other Obligations
known to the Agent and payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

                                   SECTION 10.

this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by
the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in
writing signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable Loan
Party, as the case may be, and acknowledged by the Agent, and each such waiver
or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment,
                                  --------  -------
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each of the Lenders
directly affected thereby and by the Borrower, and acknowledged by the Agent,
do any of the following:

         (a)      postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan

herein on, any Loan, or (subject to clause (ii) of the proviso below) any fees
or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document; provided,
                                                                     --------
however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to
-------
amend the definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any obligation of the
Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate;

         (c)      change the percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the Loans which is required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action
hereunder;

         (d)      change the Voting Percentage of any Lender;

         (e)      amend this Section, or  Section 2.10, or any provision herein

providing for consent or other action by all the Lenders; or

         (f)      release any Guarantor from any Guaranty;

         (g)      release all or substantially all of the Collateral;

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless

directly-affected Lender, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of
the Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (ii) the Fee
Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing
executed only by the respective parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, any Lender that has a Voting Percentage of zero shall not
have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent
hereunder.

         (b)      Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan
                  ---------------------------------------------------
Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of
any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the
same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all
Loan Parties, the Agent and the Lenders. The Agent may also require that any
such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original
thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the same
shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

         (c)      Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and internet
                  ------------------------------

thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender
from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by
such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower.
All telephonic notices to and other communications with the Agent may be
recorded by the Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such
recording.

         10.03    No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by any Lender or
the Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any

nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies,
powers and privileges herein or therein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on

or proceeding) and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all
the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), in all cases,
                                  -----------------------
whether or not caused by or arising, in whole or in part, out of the negligence
of the Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
                   --------
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the resignation of the Agent, the replacement of any Lender and the
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. All amount

payment to the Agent or any Lender, or the Agent or any Lender exercises its
right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part
thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law
or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent upon
demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such
payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time
to time in effect.

         10.07    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         (a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this
Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

         (b)      Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of the Loans at the time owing to it); provided
                                                                   --------
that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of
the assigning Lender's Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an

respect to a Lender, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of
the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Agent and,
so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower
otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement with respect to the Loans assigned, and (iii) the parties to

and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this
Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest

                -------------  ----  ----     -----
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon
request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver new or
replacement Notes to the assigning Lender and the assignee Lender. Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

         (c)      The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain at the Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and
Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each
Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").

and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (d)      Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
to, the Borrower or the Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a
natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or
Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
                        -----------
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this
                        --------
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (iii) the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to
which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
                                                           --------
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other
modification that would (i) postpone any date upon which any payment of money
is scheduled to be paid to such Participant, (ii) reduce the principal,
interest, fees or other amounts payable to such Participant, (iii) release any
Guarantor from any Guaranty, or (iv) release all or substantially all of the
Collateral. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that
each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and
                                                      -------------  ----
3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
----
assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted
by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section
                                                                   -------
10.09 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
-----
subject to Section 2.10 as though it were a Lender.
           ------------

         (e)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been
              ------------    ----
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01
                                                             ------------
unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant
and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
Section 10.17 as though it were a Lender.
-------------

         (f)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such
Lender as a party hereto.

         (g)      As used herein, the following terms have the following

         the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

                  "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is

         10.08    Confidentiality. Each of the Agent and the Lenders agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that
Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors,

Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach
of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower; or (i) to the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar
organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to

connection with ratings issued with respect to such Lender or its Affiliates.
In addition, the Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this
Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors,
similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the
Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Loans. For the purposes of
this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower
               -----------
relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that
is available to the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received
                            --------
from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified
in writing at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in

                                      58

<PAGE>

this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

         10.09    Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the
Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice
being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan
Party) to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the
credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all
Obligations owing to such Lender, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of
whether or not the Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be
contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and
the Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided,
                                                                      --------
however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
-------
such set-off and application.

         10.10    Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid
under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious
interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Agent or any
                                           ------------
Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the
excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it
exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether
the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Agent or a Lender
exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an
expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the
contemplated term of the Obligations.

         10.11    Master Services Agreements with Affiliates. The Lenders agree
to consent and authorize and instruct the Agent to consent to the Borrower
amending the Master Services Agreement to reduce the obligation of Seattle TV
to lease space in Fisher Plaza by 12,500 square feet to not less than 72,500
square feet; provided that at the time such consent is requested and given (a)
             --------
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Borrower
and Seattle Radio shall have entered into a lease with respect to Fisher Plaza,
which lease shall (i) shall be substantially in the form of the Master Services
Agreement, (ii) obligate Seattle Radio to lease not less than 12,500 square
feet of space at a Fair Market Rental Rate for a period commencing not later
than January 1, 2005 and ending not earlier than January 1, 2012 and (iii) be
otherwise be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Lenders and (c)
the Agent shall have received such consents, estoppels, subordination
agreements executed by Seattle Radio with respect to such lease as may be
requested by the Agent or any Lender.

         10.12    Tax Deferred Exchange Transactions. The Borrower may, in
connection with any Disposition made by any Loan Party, Fisher Mills or Fisher
Broadcasting, request that the Lenders consent to the transfer of the asset
which is the subject of such Disposition, or the agreement pursuant to which
such Disposition is being made, to a qualified intermediary, as part

                                      59

<PAGE>

of a tax free exchange transaction pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code (each
such transaction, a "Tax Deferred Exchange Transaction"). The Borrower shall
                     ---------------------------------
provide to the Agent with sufficient copies for each Lender (a) a written
description of the Tax Deferred Exchange Transaction for which consent is being
requested, (b) a copy of each material document, agreement and instrument (i.e.
purchase, sale, exchange and escrow agreements) executed or to be executed in
connection with such transaction and (c) such other information and copies of
such other documents pertaining to such transaction as the Agent or any Lender
may reasonably request. Each Lender shall timely provide the Borrower and the
Agent with written notice of its consent or refusal to consent to any Tax
Deferred Exchange Transaction. No Lender shall have any obligation to consent
to any Tax Deferred Exchange Transaction, and any consent given by a Lender may
be conditioned upon such terms and conditions as such Lender may in its
reasonable judgment require.  If the Required Lenders provide the Agent with
written notice of their consent to any Tax Deferred Exchange Transaction,
consent to such Tax Deferred Exchange Transaction shall be deemed given by all
Lenders. The Borrower agrees to pay or reimburse the Agent for all costs and
expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent in connection with
documenting any consent given to any Tax Deferred Exchange Transaction (whether
or not the Tax Deferred Exchange Transaction is consummated) and the
consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated by any such
consent, including all Attorney Costs.

         10.13    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         10.14    Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, comprises the complete, final and integrated agreement of the
parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. This Agreement and the
other Loan Documents may not be contradicted by evidence of prior,
contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements of the parties, and there are no
unwritten oral agreements among the parties. In the event of any conflict
between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document,
the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of
                                                --------
supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agent or the Lenders in any
other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each
Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective
parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any
party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

         10.15    Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith
or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Agent
and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Agent or any
Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Agent or any Lender may
have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time of
any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan
or any other Obligation shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

                                      60

         10.16 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to which the Borrower is a party that is prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

         10.17 Tax Forms. (a) Each Lender that is not a "United States person"
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign Lender")
                                                          --------------
shall deliver to the Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to
withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest
herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any
successor thereto (relating to such Person and entitling it to an exemption
from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such
Person by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any
successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Person by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Agent that such Person is entitled to an exemption from, or
reduction of, U.S. withholding tax. Thereafter and from time to time, each such
Person shall (i) promptly submit to the Agent such additional duly completed
and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be
adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as
may then be available under then current United States laws and regulations to
avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent of any
available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in
respect of all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) promptly notify the Agent of any change in circumstances
which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and
(iii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary
(including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement
of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for
taxes from amounts payable to such Person. If such Person fails to deliver the
above forms or other documentation, then the Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Person an amount equivalent to the applicable
withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without
reduction.

         (b) Upon the request of the Agent, each Lender that is a "United
States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall
deliver to the Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9. If such
Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable back-up
withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction.

         (c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Agent did not
properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other
amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender
shall indemnify the Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest, any
taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Agent under
this Section, and costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Agent.
The obligation of the Lenders under this Section shall survive the repayment of
all Obligations and the resignation of the Agent.

     10.18 GOVERNING LAW.

     (a)     THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE
PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE; PROVIDED THAT THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER
                                      --------
SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

     (b)     ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON
SITTING IN KING COUNTY OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF SUCH
STATE, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE BORROWER, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS
PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. THE BORROWER, THE
AGENT AND EACH LENDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION
TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH
IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN
SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT RELATED
THERETO. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY
SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS
PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH STATE.

     10.19 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH
RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR
TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT, SUBJECT TO
SECTION 10.21, ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
-------------
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY.

     10.20 Time of the Essence.  Time is of the essence of the Loan Documents.

     10.21 MANDATORY ARBITRATION.

     (a)     This Section concerns the resolution of any controversies or claims
among or between the Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent, whether arising in
contract, tort or by statute, that arise out of or relate to this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents (collectively a

                                      62

<PAGE>

"Claim"). At the request of the Borrower, any Lender or the Agent, any Claim
 -----
shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act
(Title 9, U.S. Code) (the "Act"). The Act will apply even though this Agreement
                           ---
provides that it is governed by the Laws of the state of Washington.

     (b)     Arbitration proceedings will be determined in accordance with the
Act, the rules and procedures for the arbitration of financial services disputes
of JAMS/Endispute, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company or any successor
thereof ("JAMS"), and the terms of this Section. In the event of any
          ----
inconsistency, the terms of this Section shall control. The arbitration shall
be administered by JAMS and conducted in Seattle, Washington. All Claims shall
be determined by one arbitrator; provided, however, that if Claims exceed
                                 --------  -------
$5,000,000, upon the request of any party, the Claims shall be decided by three
arbitrators. All arbitration hearings shall commence within 90 days of the
demand for arbitration and close within 90 days of commencement and the award
of the arbitrator(s) shall be issued within 30 days of the close of the
hearing; provided, however, that the arbitrator(s), upon a showing of good
         --------  -------
cause, may extend the commencement of the hearing for up to an additional 60
days. The arbitrator(s) shall provide a concise written statement of reasons
for the award. The arbitration award may be submitted to any court having
jurisdiction to be confirmed and enforced. The arbitrator(s) will have the
authority to decide whether any Claim is barred by the statute of limitations
and, if so, to dismiss the arbitration on that basis. For purposes of the
application of the statute of limitations, the service on JAMS under applicable
JAMS rules of a notice of Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit.
Any dispute concerning this arbitration provision or whether a Claim is
arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall
have the power to award legal fees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

     (c)     This Section does not limit the right of the Borrower, any Lender
or the Agent to: (i) exercise self-help remedies, such as but not limited to,
setoff; (ii) initiate judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure against any real or
personal property collateral; (iii) exercise any judicial or power of sale
rights; or (iv) act in a court of law to obtain an interim remedy, such as but
not limited to, injunctive relief, writ of possession or appointment of a
receiver, or additional or supplementary remedies. The filing of a court action
is not intended to constitute a waiver of the right of the Borrower, any Lender
or the Agent, including the suing party, thereafter to require submittal of the
Claim to arbitration.

     10.22 Oral Agreements.  ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY,
                             --------------------------------------------------
EXTEND CREDIT OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT ARE NOT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.
