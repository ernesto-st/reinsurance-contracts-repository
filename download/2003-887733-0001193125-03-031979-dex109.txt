                    excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date an
                    aggregate amount not exceeding its Pro Rata Share of the
                    aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan Commitments to be
                    used for the purposes identified in Subsection II.E.1. The
                    aggregate original amount of the Revolving Loan Commitments
                    is $100,000,000; provided that the Revolving Loan
                    Commitments of Revolving Lenders shall be adjusted to give
                    effect to any assignments of the Revolving Loan Commitments
                    pursuant to Subsection X.A.2 and shall be reduced from time
                    to time by the amount of any reductions thereto made
                    pursuant to Subsection D; and provided further that the
                    Revolving Loan Commitments of Lenders shall be adjusted to
                    give effect to (1) any assignments of the Revolving Loan
                    Commitments pursuant to Subsection 10.1B, and (2) any
                    increase in Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to
                    Subsection II.A.c. Each Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment
                    shall expire immediately and without further action on the
                    Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date and all Revolving
                    Loans and all other amounts

                                       31

<PAGE>

                    owed hereunder with respect to the Revolving Loans and the
                    Revolving Loan Commitments shall be paid in full no later
                    than that date; provided that each Revolving Lender's
                    Revolving Loan Commitment shall expire immediately and
                    without further action on May 31, 2003 if the Tranche B Term
                    Loans have not been made on or before that date. Amounts
                    borrowed under this Subsection II.A.b may be repaid and
                    reborrowed to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment
                    Termination Date.

Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Revolving Loans and the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be subject to the
limitation that in no event shall the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan
Commitments at any time exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect.

               c.   Increases of the Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan
                    Commitments. So long as no Event of Default or Potential
                    Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower
                    may, one time on or after the Closing Date, increase, at
                    Borrower's request (x) the then effective aggregate
                    principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan and/or (y) the
                    then effective aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loan
                    Commitments; provided that (1) the aggregate principal
                    amount of the increases in the Tranche B Term Loan and/or
                    Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to this Subsection
                    II.A.c shall not exceed $75,000,000, (2) Borrower shall
                    execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take
                    such other actions as may be reasonably requested by
                    Administrative Agent in connection with such increases and
                    at the time of any such proposed increase, and (3) no
                    Potential Event of Default or Event of Default shall have
                    occurred and be continuing or would occur after giving
                    effect to such increase. Any request under this Subsection
                    II.A.c shall be submitted by Borrower to Administrative
                    Agent (which shall promptly forward copies to Lenders).
                    Borrower may also specify any fees offered to those Lenders
                    (the "Increasing Lenders") which agree to increase the
                    principal amount of their applicable Tranche B Term Loan or
                    Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case may be, which fees
                    may be variable based upon the amount by which any such
                    Lender is willing to increase the principal amount of its
                    applicable Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan Commitment,
                    as the case may be. No Lender shall have any obligation,
                    express or implied, to offer to increase the aggregate
                    principal amount of its applicable Tranche B Term Loan or
                    Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be. Only the
                    consent of each Increasing Lender shall be required for an
                    increase in the aggregate principal amount of the applicable
                    Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the

                                       32

<PAGE>

                    case may be, pursuant to this Subsection II.A.c. No Lender
                    which declines to increase the principal amount of its
                    Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan Commitment, as the
                    case may be, may be replaced in respect to its existing
                    applicable Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan Commitment,
                    as the case may be, as a result thereof without such
                    Lender's consent.

          Each Increasing Lender shall as soon as practicable specify the amount
     of the proposed increase that it is willing to assume. Borrower may accept
     some or all of the offered amounts or designate new lenders that qualify as
     Eligible Assignees and that are reasonably acceptable to Administrative
     Agent as additional Lenders hereunder in accordance with this Subsection
     II.A.c (each such new lender being a "New Lender"), which New Lender may
     assume all or a portion of the increase in the aggregate principal amount
     of the applicable Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the
     case may be. Borrower and Administrative Agent shall have discretion
     jointly to adjust the allocation of the increased aggregate principal
     amount of the applicable Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan Commitments,
     as the case may be, among Increasing Lenders and New Lenders. In no event
     shall the "all-in" cost to Borrower on a percentage basis of the increased
     amount of the Tranche B Term Loan exceed the "all-in" cost to Borrower on a
     percentage basis of the Tranche B Term Loan as of the Closing Date, taking
     into account the effect of any fees or discounts.

          Subject to the foregoing, any increase requested by Borrower shall be
     effective upon delivery to Administrative Agent of each of the following
     documents: (i) an originally executed copy of an instrument of joinder
     signed by a duly authorized officer of each New Lender, in form and
     substance reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent; (ii) a notice to
     the Increasing Lenders and New Lenders, in form and substance reasonably
     acceptable to Administrative Agent, signed by a duly authorized officer of
     Borrower; (iii) an Officer's Certificate of Borrower, in form and substance
     reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent; (iv) to the extent requested
     by any New Lender or Increasing Lender, executed Tranche B Term Notes
     and/or Revolving Notes issued by Borrower in accordance with Subsection
     2.1E hereof; and (v) any other certificates or documents that
     Administrative Agent shall reasonably request, in form and substance
     reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Any such increase shall be
     in a principal amount equal to (A) the principal amount that Increasing
     Lenders are willing to assume as increases to the principal amount of their
     applicable Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case
     may be, plus (B) the principal amount offered by New Lenders with respect
     to the Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case may
     be, in either case as adjusted by Borrower and Administrative Agent
     pursuant to this Subsection 2.1A(iii). Upon effectiveness of any such
     increase, the Commitments, Pro Rata Share and outstanding Revolving Loans
     of each Lender will be adjusted to give effect to the increase in the
     Tranche B Term Loan or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case may be. To
     the extent that the adjustment of Pro Rata Shares results in losses or
     expenses to any Lender as a result of the prepayment of any LIBOR Loan on a
     date other than the scheduled last day of the applicable Interest

                                       33

<PAGE>

     Period, Borrower shall be responsible for such losses or expenses pursuant
     to Subsection F.3.

          2.   Borrowing Mechanics. Revolving Loans made on any Funding Date
               (other than Revolving Loans made pursuant to Subsection III.C.1
               for the purpose of reimbursing any Issuing Lender for the amount
               of a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it) shall be Base
               Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans in the applicable Minimum Amount
               therefor. Whenever Borrower desires that Lenders make Revolving
               Loans it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Notice of
               Borrowing no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least
               three Business Days in advance of the proposed Funding Date (in
               the case of a LIBOR Loan) or no later than 12:00 Noon (New York
               City time) on the proposed Funding Date (in the case of a Base
               Rate Loan). The Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the
               proposed Funding Date (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the
               amount and Type of Loans requested, (iii) in the case of any
               Loans made on the Closing Date, that such Loans shall be Base
               Rate Loans, (iv) in the case of Loans not made on the Closing
               Date, whether such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans,
               (v) in the case of any Loans requested to be made as LIBOR Loans,
               the initial Interest Period requested therefor and (vi)
               information about the account of Borrower to be credited. Loans
               may be continued as or converted into Base Rate Loans and LIBOR
               Loans in the manner provided in Subsection II.B.3. In lieu of
               delivering the above-described Notice of Borrowing for any Loan,
               Borrower may give Administrative Agent telephonic notice by the
               required time of any proposed borrowing under this Subsection
               II.A.2; provided that such notice shall be promptly confirmed in
               writing by delivery of a Notice of Borrowing to Administrative
               Agent at Administrative Agent's Office no later than 2:00 P.M.
               (New York City time) on the date such notice was given.

          None of Administrative Agent or any Lender shall incur any liability
to Borrower in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that
Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly
authorized Officer or other Person authorized to borrow on behalf of Borrower or
for otherwise acting in good faith under this Subsection II.A.2, and upon
funding of Loans by Lenders in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any
such telephonic notice Borrower shall have effected a borrowing of Loans
hereunder.

          Borrower shall notify Administrative Agent prior to the funding of any
Loans if any of the matters to which Borrower is required to certify in the
applicable Notice of Borrowing is no longer true and correct as of the
applicable Funding Date, and the acceptance by Borrower of the proceeds of any
Loans shall constitute a re-certification by Borrower, as of the applicable
Funding Date, as to the matters to which Borrower is required to certify in the
applicable Notice of Borrowing.

                                       34

<PAGE>

          Except as otherwise provided in Subsections II.F.1, II.F.2 and II.F.6,
a Notice of Borrowing for LIBOR Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof)
shall be irrevocable once Administrative Agent receives such notice, and
Borrower shall be bound to make a borrowing in accordance therewith.

          3.   Disbursement of Funds. All Term Loans and Revolving Loans under
               this Agreement shall be made by Lenders having a Commitment of
               that Type simultaneously and proportionately to their respective
               Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that neither Administrative
               Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for any default by any
               other Lender in that other Lender's obligation to make a Loan
               requested hereunder nor shall the Commitment of any Lender to
               make the particular Type of Loan requested be increased or
               decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in that
               other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder.
               Promptly after receipt by Administrative Agent of a Notice of
               Borrowing pursuant to Subsection 1.1A or II.A.2 (or telephonic
               notice in lieu thereof), Administrative Agent shall notify each
               Lender for that Type of Loan, as the case may be, of the proposed
               borrowing. Each such Lender shall make the amount of its Loan
               available to Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
               Office not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) for LIBOR
               Loans, and not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) for Base
               Rate Loans, on the applicable Funding Date in same day funds in
               Dollars. Except as provided in Subsection III.C.1 with respect to
               Revolving Loans used to reimburse any Issuing Lender for the
               amount of a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it, upon
               satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent specified in
               Subsections IV.A (in the case of Loans made on the Closing Date)
               and IV.B (in the case of all Loans), Administrative Agent shall
               make the proceeds of such Loans available to Borrower on the
               applicable Funding Date by causing an amount of same day funds in
               Dollars equal to the proceeds of all such Loans received by
               Administrative Agent from Lenders to be wire-transferred to an
               account of Borrower as specified in the applicable Notice of
               Borrowing.

          Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender
prior to a Funding Date for any Loans that such Lender does not intend to make
available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's Loan requested on
such Funding Date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such amount available to Administrative Agent on such Funding Date and
Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to Borrower a corresponding amount on such Funding Date. If such
corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by
such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon,
for each day from such Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to
Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the
correction of errors among banks for three

                                       35

<PAGE>

Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. If such Lender does not pay such
corresponding amount forthwith upon Administrative Agent's demand therefor,
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and Borrower shall
immediately pay such corresponding amount to Administrative Agent together with
interest thereon, for each day from such Funding Date until the date such amount
is paid to Administrative Agent, at the rate payable under this Agreement for
Base Rate Loans for such Type of Loans. Nothing in this Subsection II.A.3 shall
be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments
hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrower may have against any Lender
as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

          4.   The Register.

               a.   Administrative Agent shall maintain, at its address referred
                    to in Subsection X.H, a register for the recordation of the
                    names and addresses of Lenders and the Commitments and Loans
                    of each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The
                    Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower at
                    any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
                    prior notice.

               b.   Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the
                    Tranche B Term Loan Commitment and Revolving Loan Commitment
                    and the Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans from time
                    to time of each Lender and each repayment or prepayment in
                    respect of the principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans
                    or Revolving Loans of each Lender. Any such recordation
                    shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amounts
                    borrowed hereunder; provided that failure to make any such
                    recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not
                    affect any Lender's Commitments or Borrower's Obligations in
                    respect of any applicable Loans.

               c.   Each Lender may record on its internal records (including
                    the Notes held by such Lender) the amount of the Tranche B
                    Term Loans and each Revolving Loan made by it and each
                    payment in respect thereof. Any such recordation shall
                    constitute prima facie evidence of the amounts borrowed
                    hereunder; provided that failure to make any such
                    recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not
                    affect any Lender's Commitments or Borrower's Obligations in
                    respect of any applicable Loans; and provided further that
                    in the event of any inconsistency between the Register and
                    any Lender's records, the recordations in the Register shall
                    govern (absent manifest error).

               d.   Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall deem and
                    treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the
                    holders and owners of the corresponding Commitments and
                    Loans listed therein for all purposes hereof, and no
                    assignment or transfer of

                                       36

<PAGE>

                    any such Commitment or Loan shall be effective, in each case
                    unless and until an Assignment Agreement effecting the
                    assignment or transfer thereof shall have been accepted by
                    Administrative Agent and recorded in the Register as
                    provided in Subsection X.A.2.b. Prior to such recordation,
                    all amounts owed with respect to the applicable Commitment
                    or Loan shall be owed to the Lender listed in the Register
                    as the owner thereof, and any request, authority or consent
                    of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
                    giving such authority or consent, is listed in the Register
                    as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding on any
                    subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the
                    corresponding Commitments or Loans.

               e.   Borrower hereby designates CIBC to serve as Borrower's agent
                    solely for purposes of maintaining the Register as provided
                    in this Subsection II.A.4, and Borrower hereby agrees that,
                    to the extent CIBC serves in such capacity, CIBC and its
                    officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates shall
                    constitute Indemnitees for all purposes under Subsection
                    X.C.

          5.   Optional Notes. If so requested by any Lender by written notice
               to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) at least two
               Business Days prior to the Closing Date or at any time
               thereafter, Borrower shall execute and deliver on the Closing
               Date or within three Business Days after receipt of written
               request therefor to the requesting Lender (or to Administrative
               Agent for that Lender, if requested by such Lender) (i) a Tranche
               B Term Note substantially in the form of Exhibit IV annexed
               hereto to evidence that Lender's Tranche B Term Loan, in the
               principal amount of that Lender's Tranche B Term Loan and with
               other appropriate insertions, and (ii) a Revolving Note
               substantially in the form of Exhibit V annexed hereto to evidence
               that Lender's Revolving Loans, in the principal amount of that
               Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment and with other appropriate
               insertions.

          Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the
owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until an Assignment Agreement
effecting the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been accepted by
Administrative Agent as provided in Subsection X.A.2.b. Any request,
authorization or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request
or giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note (or Loan) shall
be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of
that Note (or Loan) or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

          If Borrower increases the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B
Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case may be, pursuant to
Subsection II.A.c, Borrower shall issue replacement Tranche B Term Notes and/or
Revolving Notes, as the case may be, to each Increasing Lender (or to
Administrative Agent for such Increasing Lender) that

                                       37

requests a Note in accordance with the terms hereof and new Tranche B Term
Notes and/or Revolving Notes, as the case may be, to each New Lender (or to
Administrative Agent for such New Lender) that requests a Note in accordance
with the terms hereof.

     B.   Interest on the Loans.
          ---------------------

          1.   Rate of Interest. Subject to the provisions of Subsections II.F
               and II.G, each Term Loan and each Revolving Loan shall bear
               interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date
               made through maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a
               rate determined by reference to the Base Rate or Adjusted LIBOR.
               The applicable basis for determining the rate of interest with
               respect to any Term Loan or any Revolving Loan shall be selected
               by Borrower initially at the time a Notice of Borrowing is given
               with respect to such Loan pursuant to Subsection II.A.2, and the
               basis for determining the interest rate with respect to any Term
               Loan or any Revolving Loan may be changed from time to time
               pursuant to Subsection II.B.4 (subject to the last sentence of
               Subsection A.2). If on any day a Term Loan or Revolving Loan is
               outstanding with respect to which notice has not been delivered
               to Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this
               Agreement specifying the applicable basis for determining the
               rate of interest, then for that day that Loan shall bear interest
               determined by reference to the Base Rate.

          Subject to the provisions of Subsections II.B.5 and II.G, the Tranche
B Term Loans and the Revolving Loans shall bear interest through maturity as
follows:

               a.   if a Base Rate Loan, then at the sum of the Base Rate plus
                    the Applicable Base Rate Margin for such Type of Loans; or

               b.   if a LIBOR Loan, then at the sum of Adjusted LIBOR plus the
                    Applicable LIBOR Margin for such Type of Loans.

          Upon delivery of a Margin Determination Certificate by Borrower to
Administrative Agent (a) with respect to each Fiscal Quarter (other than each
fourth Fiscal Quarter), together with the three most recent financial statements
required to be delivered pursuant to Subsection 6.1(i), and (b) with respect to
each fourth Fiscal Quarter, within forty-five (45) days after the last day of
such fourth Fiscal Quarter (to be included as part of the Compliance Certificate
for each such Fiscal Quarter), the Applicable Base Rate Margin and Applicable
LIBOR Margin shall automatically be adjusted in accordance with such Margin
Determination Certificate, such adjustment to become effective on the 60th day
after the end of the Fiscal Quarter to which the financial results contained in
the Margin Determination Certificate relate; provided that (1) at any time a
Margin Determination Certificate is not delivered within forty-five (45) days
after the last day of any Fiscal Quarter, from the forty-fifth day until
delivery of such Margin Determination Certificate, the Applicable Base Rate
Margin shall be 1.25% for Revolving Loans, and 1.25% for Tranche B Term Loans,
and the Applicable LIBOR Margin shall be 2.75% for Revolving Loans, and 2.75%
for Tranche B Term Loans, and

                                       38

<PAGE>

(2) if a Margin Determination Certificate erroneously indicates (as determined
by Administrative Agent after consultation with Borrower) an applicable margin
more favorable to Borrower than should be afforded by the actual calculation of
the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, Borrower shall promptly pay additional
interest and letter of credit fees required to correct for such error.

          2.   Interest Periods. In connection with each LIBOR Loan, Borrower
               may, pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
               Conversion/Continuation, as the case may be, select an interest
               period (each an "Interest Period") to be applicable to such Loan,
               which Interest Period shall be, at Borrower's option, either a
               one, two, three or six month period; provided that:

               a.   the initial Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan shall
                    commence on the Funding Date in respect of such Loan, in the
                    case of a Loan initially made as a LIBOR Loan, or on the
                    date specified in the applicable Notice of
                    Conversion/Continuation, in the case of a Loan converted to
                    a LIBOR Loan;

               b.   in the case of immediately successive Interest Periods
                    applicable to a LIBOR Loan continued as such pursuant to a
                    Notice of Conversion/Continuation, each successive Interest
                    Period shall commence on the day on which the next preceding
                    Interest Period expires;

               c.   if an Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that
                    is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on
                    the next succeeding Business Day; provided that, if any
                    Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not
                    a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no
                    further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest
                    Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

               d.   any Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day of
                    a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no
                    numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the
                    end of such Interest Period) shall, subject to clause (v) of
                    this Subsection II.B.2, end on the last Business Day of a
                    calendar month;

               e.   no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the
                    Tranche B Term Loans shall extend beyond May __, 2009, and
                    no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the
                    Revolving Loans shall extend beyond the Revolving Loan
                    Commitment Termination Date;

               f.   no Interest Period with respect to the Tranche B Term Loans
                    shall extend beyond a date on which Borrower is required to
                    make a

                                       39

<PAGE>

                    scheduled payment of principal of the Tranche B Term Loans,
                    unless the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of the
                    Tranche B Term Loans that are Base Rate Loans plus (b) the
                    aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans that
                    are LIBOR Loans with Interest Periods expiring on or before
                    such date equals or exceeds the principal amount required to
                    be paid on the Tranche B Term Loans on such date;

               g.   there shall be no more than ten (10) Interest Periods
                    outstanding at any time; and

               h.   if Borrower fails to specify an Interest Period for any
                    LIBOR Loan in the applicable Notice of Borrowing, Borrower
                    shall be deemed to have requested a Base Rate Loan.

          3.   Interest Payments. Subject to the provisions of Subsection
               II.B.5, interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on and
               to each Interest Payment Date applicable to that Loan, upon any
               prepayment of that Loan (to the extent accrued on the amount
               being prepaid) and at maturity (including final maturity)
               provided that if any Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans are
               prepaid pursuant to Subsection II.D.2.a, interest accrued on such
               Loans through the date of such prepayment shall be payable on the
               next succeeding Interest Payment Date applicable to Base Rate
               Loans (or, if earlier, at final maturity).

          4.   Conversion or Continuation.

               a.   Subject to the provisions of Subsection II.G, Borrower shall
                    have the option (i) to convert at any time all or any part
                    of its outstanding Term Loans or Revolving Loans from Loans
                    bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to one
                    basis to Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by
                    reference to an alternative basis, in each case in the
                    applicable Minimum Amount therefor, or (ii) upon the
                    expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a LIBOR
                    Loan, to continue all or any portion of such Loan equal to
                    the Minimum Amount as a LIBOR Loan; provided, however, that
                    a LIBOR Loan may only be converted into a Base Rate Loan on
                    the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable
                    thereto.

               b.   Borrower shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation
                    to Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 Noon (New York
                    City time) at least three Business Days in advance of the
                    proposed conversion date (in the case of a conversion to a
                    Base Rate Loan) and at least three Business Days in advance
                    of the proposed conversion/continuation date (in the case of
                    a conversion to, or a continuation of, a LIBOR Loan). With
                    respect to any LIBOR

                                       40

<PAGE>

                    Loan, if Borrower fails to deliver a Notice of
                    Conversion/Continuation as described above or if any
                    proposed conversion/continuation under this Subsection
                    II.B.4 is not permitted hereunder, Borrower shall be deemed
                    to have elected to convert such LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate
                    Loan on the last day of the then-expiring Interest Period.

               c.   A Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall specify (a) the
                    proposed conversion/continuation date (which shall be a
                    Business Day), (b) the amount and type of the Loan to be
                    converted/continued, (c) the nature of the proposed
                    conversion/ continuation, (d) in the case of a conversion
                    to, or a continuation of, a LIBOR Loan, the requested
                    Interest Period, and (e) in the case of a conversion to, or
                    a continuation of, a LIBOR Loan, that no Potential Event of
                    Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
                    In lieu of delivering the above-described Notice of
                    Conversion/Continuation, Borrower may give Administrative
                    Agent telephonic notice by the required time of any proposed
                    conversion/continuation under this Subsection II.B.4,
                    provided that Administrative Agent shall receive a Notice of
                    Conversion/Continuation to confirm such telephonic notice no
                    later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day on
                    which such telephonic notice is given. Upon receipt of
                    written or telephonic notice of any proposed
                    conversion/continuation under this Subsection II.B.4,
                    Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit such notice by
                    telefacsimile or electronic mail (or by telephone promptly
                    confirmed by telefacsimile or electronic mail) to each
                    Lender.

          (iv) Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any
     liability to Borrower in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to
     above that Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given
     by a duly authorized Officer or other Person authorized to act on behalf of
     Borrower or for otherwise acting in good faith under this Subsection
     II.B.4, and upon conversion or continuation of the applicable basis for
     determining the interest rate with respect to any Loans in accordance with
     this Agreement pursuant to any such telephonic notice Borrower shall have
     effected a conversion or continuation, as the case may be, hereunder.

          (v)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsections F.1, F.2 and F.6, a
     notice of a proposed conversion to, or continuation of, a LIBOR Loan
     (whether by delivery of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation or telephonic
     notice) shall be irrevocable once Administrative Agent receives such
     notice, and Borrower shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation
     in accordance therewith.

          5.   Default Rate. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of
               any Event of Default, at the election of Administrative Agent or
               Requisite

                                       41

<PAGE>

               Lenders the outstanding principal amount of all Loans and, to the
               extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments thereon
               not paid when due and any fees and other amounts then due and
               payable hereunder, shall thereafter bear interest (including
               post-petition interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy
               Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable upon demand at
               a rate that is 2.00% per annum in excess of the interest rate
               then in effect with respect to the applicable Loans (or, in the
               case of any such fees and other amounts, at a rate which is 2.00%
               per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under
               this Agreement for Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans);
               provided that, in the case of LIBOR Loans, upon the expiration of
               each Interest Period in effect at the time any such increase in
               interest rate is effective such LIBOR Loans shall thereupon
               become Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear interest
               (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under the
               Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable upon
               demand at a rate which is 2.00% per annum in excess of the
               interest rate then in effect for Revolving Loans that are Base
               Rate Loans. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of
               interest provided for in this Subsection II.B.5 is not a
               permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute
               a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit
               any rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender.

          6.   Computation of Interest. Interest on the Loans and other
               Obligations shall be computed (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans,
               on the basis of a 365/366-day year (as applicable), and (ii) in
               the case of LIBOR Loans and other Obligations (other than Base
               Rate Loans), on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the
               actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it
               accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the
               making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period
               applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan
               being converted from a LIBOR Loan, the date of conversion of such
               LIBOR Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be
               included, and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration
               date of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with
               respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a LIBOR Loan, the
               date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such LIBOR Loan, as
               the case may be, shall be excluded; provided that if a Loan is
               repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's interest
               shall be paid on that Loan.

          7.   Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
               Subsection B, in no event shall the rate of interest payable by
               Borrower with respect to any Loan exceed the maximum rate of
               interest permitted to be charged under applicable law.

     C.   Fees.
          ----

          1.   Revolving Loan Commitment Fees. Borrower agrees to pay to
               Administrative Agent, for distribution to each Lender in
               proportion to that Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan
               Commitments, commitment fees for the period from and including
               the Closing Date to and excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment
               Termination Date equal to the average of the daily excess of the
               Revolving Loan Commitments over the Total Utilization of
               Revolving Loan Commitments multiplied by (i) until the date that
               is five Business Days after the date on which the first Margin
               Determination Certificate is scheduled to be delivered to
               Administrative Agent pursuant to Subsection 2.2A, one half of 1%
               per annum, and (ii), thereafter, at the applicable Commitment Fee
               Percentage, such commitment fees to be calculated on the basis of
               a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and to be
               payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
               March, June, September and December of each year commencing on
               the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the
               Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date.

          2.   Other Fees. Borrower agrees to pay to Co-Lead Arrangers and
               Administrative Agent such fees in the amounts and at the times
               separately agreed upon between Borrower, Co-Lead Arrangers and
               Administrative Agent.

under this Agreement with respect to the Tranche B Term Loans; and provided,
further that if the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans is
increased pursuant to Subsection 2.1A(iii), then each scheduled principal
repayment to be made after such increase becomes effective shall be increased by
an amount equal to (a) the aggregate principal amount of the increase in the
Tranche B Term Loans pursuant to Subsection II.A.c multiplied by (b) an amount
equal to (x) such scheduled repayment amount divided by (y) the aggregate
principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans to be repaid immediately prior to

Subsection 2.1A(iii).

          2.   Prepayments and Unscheduled Reductions in Revolving Loan
               Commitments.

               a.   Voluntary Prepayments. Borrower may, upon not less than one
                    Business Day's irrevocable prior written notice, in the case
                    of Base Rate Loans, and three Business Days' irrevocable
                    prior written notice, in the case of LIBOR Loans, in each
                    case given to Administrative Agent by 12:00 Noon (New York
                    City time) on the date required (which written notice
                    Administrative Agent will promptly transmit by telefacsimile
                    or electronic mail to each Lender for the Loans to be
                    prepaid), at any time and from time to time prepay any
                    Tranche B Term Loans or Revolving Loans on any Business Day
                    in whole or in part in an aggregate minimum amount of
                    $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of
                    that amount; provided, however, that any LIBOR Loan may be
                    prepaid on a day other than the expiration of the Interest
                    Period applicable thereto, only if Borrower pays the amounts
                    due pursuant to Subsection II.F.3 caused by such prepayment.
                    Notice of prepayment having been given as aforesaid, the
                    principal amount of the Loans specified in such notice shall
                    become due and payable on the prepayment date specified
                    therein. Any such voluntary prepayment shall be applied as
                    specified in Subsection II.D.2.d.

               b.   Voluntary Reductions of Revolving Loan Commitments. Borrower
                    may, upon not less than five Business Days' irrevocable
                    prior written notice to Administrative Agent (which written
                    notice Administrative Agent will promptly transmit to each
                    Lender), at any time and from time to time terminate in
                    whole or permanently reduce in part, without premium or
                    penalty, the Revolving Loan Commitments in an amount up to
                    the amount by which the Revolving Loan Commitments exceed
                    the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments at the
                    time of such proposed termination or reduction; provided
                    that any such partial reduction of the Revolving Loan
                    Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of
                    $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of
                    that amount. Borrower's notice to Administrative Agent shall
                    designate the date (which shall be a

                                       45

<PAGE>

                    Business Day) of such termination or reduction and the
                    amount of any partial reduction, and such termination or
                    reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
                    effective on the date specified in Borrower's notice and
                    shall reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment of each Revolving
                    Lender proportionately according to its Pro Rata Share.

               c.   Mandatory Prepayments and Mandatory Reductions of Revolving
                    Loan Commitments. The Loans shall be prepaid and/or the
                    Revolving Loan Commitments shall be permanently reduced in
                    the amounts and under the circumstances set forth below, all
                    such prepayments and/or reductions to be applied as set
                    forth below or as more specifically provided in Subsection
                    II.D.2.d:

                    (1)  Prepayments and Reductions From Net Asset Sale
                         Proceeds. No later than five (5) days from the date of

                         Net Asset Sale Proceeds in respect of any Asset Sale
                         (other than a sale of Capital Stock covered by
                         Subsection 2.4B(iii)(c)), Borrower shall either (1)
                         prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments
                         shall be permanently reduced in an aggregate amount
                         equal to such Net Asset Sale Proceeds or (2) so long as
                         no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default shall
                         have occurred and be continuing and to the extent that
                         aggregate Net Asset Sale Proceeds from the Closing Date
                         through the date of determination do not exceed
                         $5,000,000, deliver to Administrative Agent an
                         Officer's Certificate setting forth (x) that portion of
                         such Net Asset Sale Proceeds that Borrower or such
                         Subsidiary intends to reinvest in equipment or other
                         productive assets of the general type used in the
                         business of Borrower and its Subsidiaries within one
                         hundred eighty (180) days of such date of receipt and
                         (y) the proposed use of such portion of the Net Asset
                         Sale Proceeds and such other information with respect
                         to such reinvestment as Administrative Agent may
                         reasonably request, and Borrower shall, or shall cause
                         one or more of its Subsidiaries to, promptly and
                         diligently apply such portion to such reinvestment
                         purposes; provided, however, that pending such
                         reinvestment such portion of the Net Asset Sale
                         Proceeds shall be applied to prepay outstanding
                         Revolving Loans (without a reduction in Revolving Loan
                         Commitments) to the full extent thereof. In addition,
                         Borrower shall, no later than one hundred eighty (180)

                         theretofore been applied to the Loans (other than any
                         prepayment of Revolving Loans not resulting in a
                         corresponding reduction in the Revolving Loan
                         Commitments) or that have not been so reinvested as

                         after the Closing Date, if the Consolidated Total
                         Leverage Ratio for the Fiscal Quarter most recently
                         ended exceeds 3.00:1.00, Borrower shall prepay the
                         Loans and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be

                         return, including incremental taxes payable as a result
                         thereof.

                    (5)  Prepayments and Reductions Due to Issuance of

                         issuance of Indebtedness permitted pursuant to
                         Subsection VII.A(vii) of Borrower or any of its
                         Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, if the
                         Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio for the Fiscal
                         Quarter most recently ended exceeds 3.00:1.00, Borrower
                         shall prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan
                         Commitments shall be permanently reduced in an
                         aggregate amount equal to the lesser of fifty percent
                         (50%) of such Net Securities Proceeds or such amount as
                         will bring the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to not
                         more than 3.00:1.00.

                    (6)  Prepayments and Reductions from Consolidated Excess
                         Cash Flow. If there is Consolidated Excess Cash Flow

                         and if the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio as of the
                         end of such Fiscal Year exceeds 3.00:1.00, Borrower
                         shall, no later than one hundred twenty (120) days
                         after the end of such Fiscal Year, prepay the Loans

                         permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to the
                         lesser of fifty percent (50%) of such Consolidated
                         Excess Cash Flow or such amount as will bring the
                         Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to not more than
                         3.00:1.00.

                    (7)  Calculations of Net Proceeds Amounts; Additional
                         Prepayments and Reductions Based on Subsequent
                         Calculations. Concurrently with any prepayment of the
                         Loans and/or reduction of the Revolving Loan
                         Commitments pursuant to Subsections II.D.2.c(1)-(f),
                         Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent an
                         Officer's Certificate demonstrating the calculation of
                         the amount (the "Net Proceeds Amount") of the
                         applicable Net Asset Sale Proceeds, Net
                         Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, Net Pension Proceeds,
                         Net Securities Proceeds, or Consolidated Excess Cash
                         Flow, as the case may be, that gave rise to such
                         prepayment and/or reduction. If Borrower subsequently
                         determines that the actual Net Proceeds Amount was
                         greater than the amount set forth in such Officer's
                         Certificate (including if any actual taxes to be paid
                         as a result of an Asset Sale is less than the estimated
                         taxes to be paid as a result of such Asset Sale),
                         Borrower

                         Commitments shall be permanently reduced) in an amount
                         equal to the amount of such excess, and Borrower shall
                         concurrently therewith deliver to Administrative Agent
                         an Officer's Certificate demonstrating the derivation
                         of the additional Net Proceeds Amount resulting in such
                         excess.

                    (8)  Prepayments Due to Reductions or Restrictions of
                         Revolving Loan Commitments. Borrower shall from time to
                         time prepay the Revolving Loans (or, if the Revolving
                         Loans have been prepaid in full, cash collateralize
                         Letters of Credit) to the extent necessary so that the
                         Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments shall
                         not at any time exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments
                         then in effect.

               d.   Application of Prepayments.

                    (1)  Application of Voluntary Prepayments by Type of Loans
                         and Order of Maturity. Subject to the provisions of
                         Subsection D4, any voluntary prepayments pursuant to
                         Subsection II.D.2.a shall be applied as specified by
                         Borrower in the applicable notice of prepayment;
                         provided that if Borrower fails to specify the Loans to
                         which any such prepayment shall be applied, such
                         prepayment shall be applied first to repay outstanding
                         Tranche B Term Loans to the full extent thereof, second
                         to prepay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full
                         extent thereof and permanently reduce the Revolving
                         Loan Commitments and third to cash collateralize any
                         outstanding Letters of Credit and to further
                         permanently reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments by
                         the amount of such prepayment. Any voluntary
                         prepayments of the Tranche B Term Loans pursuant to
                         Subsection II.D.2.a shall be applied to reduce the
                         scheduled installments of principal of the Tranche B
                         Term Loans set forth in Subsection 2.4A(i) in inverse
                         chronological order of maturity.

                    (2)  Application of Mandatory Prepayments by Type of Loans.
                         Subject to Subsection II.D.4, any amount (the "Applied
                         Amount") required to be applied as a mandatory
                         prepayment of the Loans and/or a reduction of the
                         Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to Subsections
                         II.D.2.c(1)-(7) shall be applied first to prepay the
                         Tranche B Term Loans to the full extent thereof,
                         second, to the

                                       49

<PAGE>

                         extent of any remaining portion of such Applied Amount,
                         to prepay the Revolving Loans to the full extent
                         thereof and to cash collateralize any outstanding
                         Letters of Credit and to further permanently reduce the
                         Revolving Loan Commitments by the amount of such
                         prepayment, and third, to the extent of any remaining
                         portion of such Applied Amount, to further permanently
                         reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments to the full
                         extent thereof.

                    (3)  Application of Mandatory Prepayments to Tranche B Term
                         Loans and the Scheduled Installments of Principal
                         Thereof. Subject to Subsection II.D.4, any mandatory
                         prepayments of the Tranche B Term Loans pursuant to
                         Subsection II.D.2.c shall be applied to reduce the
                         scheduled installments of principal of the Tranche B
                         Term Loans in inverse chronological order of maturity.

                    (4)  Application of Prepayments to Base Rate Loans and LIBOR
                         Loans. Considering Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving
                         Loans being prepaid separately, any prepayment thereof
                         shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full
                         extent thereof before application to LIBOR Loans, in
                         each case in a manner which minimizes the amount of any
                         payments required to be made by Borrower pursuant to
                         Subsection F.3.

          3.   General Provisions Regarding Payments.

               a.   Manner and Time of Payment. All payments by Borrower of
                    principal, interest, fees and other Obligations hereunder
                    and under the Notes shall be made in Dollars in same day
                    funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any
                    restriction or condition, and delivered to Administrative
                    Agent not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the
                    date due at the Administrative Agent's Office for the
                    account of Lenders; funds received by Administrative Agent
                    after that time on such due date shall be deemed to have
                    been paid by Borrower on the next succeeding Business Day.
                    Borrower hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to charge
                    its accounts with Administrative Agent in order to cause
                    timely payment to be made to Administrative Agent of all
                    principal, interest, fees and expenses due hereunder
                    (subject to sufficient funds being available in its accounts
                    for that purpose).

               b.   Application of Payments. Prior to any payments being applied
                    to principal or interest under this Agreement or under the
                    Notes, such payments shall first be applied to any
                    outstanding and payable

                                       50

<PAGE>

                    fees, costs, expenses, indemnities or other amounts (other
                    than principal or interest due under the Loan Documents), as
                    determined in the reasonable opinion of Administrative
                    Agent. Except as provided in Subsection II.B.3, all payments
                    in respect of the principal amount of any Loan shall include
                    payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being
                    repaid or prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event,
                    any payments in respect of any Loan on a date when interest
                    is due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall be
                    applied to the payment of interest before application to
                    principal.

               c.   Apportionment of Payments. Aggregate principal and interest
                    payments in respect of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall
                    be apportioned among all outstanding Loans to which such
                    payments relate, in each case proportionately according to
                    Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares. Administrative Agent
                    shall promptly distribute to each Lender, at its primary
                    address set forth in the Register or at such other address
                    as such Lender may request, its Pro Rata Share of all such
                    payments received by Administrative Agent and the commitment
                    fees of such Lender, if any, when received by Administrative
                    Agent pursuant to Subsection II.C. Notwithstanding the
                    foregoing provisions of this Subsection II.D.3.c, if,
                    pursuant to the provisions of Subsection F.2, any Notice of
                    Conversion/Continuation is withdrawn as to any Affected
                    Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in
                    lieu of its Pro Rata Share of any LIBOR Loans,
                    Administrative Agent shall give effect thereto in
                    apportioning payments received thereafter.

               d.   Payments on Business Days. Whenever any payment to be made
                    hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a
                    Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
                    succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
                    included in the computation of the payment of interest
                    hereunder or of the commitment fees hereunder, as the case
                    may be.

          4.   Application of Proceeds of Collateral and Payments after Event of
               Default.

               a.   Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event
                    of Default, (a) all payments received on account of the
                    Obligations, whether from Borrower, from any Subsidiary
                    Guarantor or otherwise, shall be applied by Administrative
                    Agent against the Obligations and (b) all proceeds received
                    by Administrative Agent in respect of any sale of,
                    collection from, or other realization upon all or any part
                    of the Collateral under any Collateral Document

                                       51

<PAGE>

                    may, in the discretion of Administrative Agent, be held by
                    Administrative Agent as Collateral for, and/or (then or at
                    any time thereafter) applied in full or in part by
                    Administrative Agent against, the applicable Secured
                    Obligations (as defined in such Collateral Document), in
                    each case in the following order of priority:

                    (1)  To the payment of all costs and expenses of such sale,
                         collection or other realization, including reasonable
                         fees and expenses of Administrative Agent and its
                         agents and counsel, and all other expenses, liabilities
                         and advances (other than advances made by
                         Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders) made or
                         incurred by Administrative Agent in connection
                         therewith, and all amounts for which Administrative
                         Agent is entitled to compensation (including the fees
                         described in Subsection C), reimbursement and
                         indemnification under any Loan Document and all
                         advances made by Administrative Agent thereunder for
                         the account of the applicable Loan Party (other than
                         advances made to a Loan Party for purposes of making a
                         payment to any Lender that would otherwise be shared
                         pro rata pursuant to clause (b) below), and to the
                         payment of all costs and expenses paid or incurred by
                         Administrative Agent in connection with the Loan
                         Documents, all in accordance with Subsections IX.D, X.B
                         and X.C and the other terms of this Agreement and the
                         other Loan Documents;

                    (2)  thereafter, to the payment of all other Secured
                         Obligations (as defined in such Collateral Document) or
                         Guarantied Obligations (as defined in the Subsidiary
                         Guaranty) for the ratable benefit of the holders
                         thereof (subject to the provisions of Subsection D3.b);
                         and

                    (3)  thereafter, to the payment to or upon the order of such
                         Loan Party or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to
                         receive the same or as a court of competent
                         jurisdiction may direct.

     E.   Use of Proceeds.
          ---------------

          1.   Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans. The proceeds of the
               Tranche B Term Loans and the Revolving Loans shall be applied by
               Borrower (i) to fund the refinancing of the Existing Credit
               Agreement and other existing Indebtedness of Borrower and its
               Subsidiaries, and (ii) for working capital and other general
               corporate purposes, acquisitions and investments made in
               accordance with the terms hereof, payments of

                                       52

<PAGE>

               litigation judgments or settlement of claims, and payment of
               Transaction Costs.

          2.   Margin Regulations. No portion of the proceeds of any borrowing
               under this Agreement shall be used by Borrower or any of its
               Subsidiaries in any manner that might cause the borrowing or the
               application of such proceeds to violate Regulation T, Regulation
               U or Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
               Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board or to
               violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect on the date
               or dates of such borrowing and such use of proceeds.

     F.   Special Provisions Governing LIBOR Loans.
          ----------------------------------------

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the following provisions shall govern with respect to LIBOR Loans as to the
matters covered:

          C.   Determination of Applicable Interest Rate. As soon as practicable
after 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date,
Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall constitute prima
facie evidence of such matters) the interest rate that shall apply to the LIBOR
Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the applicable
Interest Period and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by
telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower and each Lender.

          1.   Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate. If
               Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination
               shall constitute prima facie evidence of such matters), on any
               Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any LIBOR Loans,
               that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank
               Eurodollar market adequate and fair means do not exist for
               ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the
               basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted LIBOR,
               Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by
               telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower
               and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may
               be made as, or converted to, LIBOR Loans until such time as
               Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and Lenders that the
               circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist and (ii)
               any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation
               given by Borrower with respect to the Loans in respect of which
               such determination was made shall be deemed to be for a Base Rate
               Loan.

          2.   Illegality or Impracticability of LIBOR Loans. If on any date any
               Lender shall have determined (which determination shall
               constitute prima facie evidence of such matters but shall be made
               only after consultation with Borrower and Administrative Agent)
               that the making, maintaining or continuation of its LIBOR Loans
               (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender
               in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule,
               regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with

                                       53

<PAGE>

               any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or
               order not having the force of law even though the failure to
               comply therewith would not be unlawful) or (ii) has become
               impracticable, or would cause such Lender material hardship, as a
               result of contingencies occurring after the date of this
               Agreement which materially and adversely affect the interbank
               Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in that market,
               then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an "Affected
               Lender" and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or
               by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower and Administrative
               Agent of such determination (which notice Administrative Agent
               shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Thereafter (a) the
               obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to convert
               Loans to, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall
               be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (b) to the extent such
               determination by the Affected Lender relates to a LIBOR Loan then
               being requested by Borrower pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or
               a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Affected Lender shall
               make such Loan as (or convert such Loan to, as the case may be) a
               Base Rate Loan, (c) the Affected Lender's obligation to maintain
               its outstanding LIBOR Loans (the "Affected Loans") shall be
               terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the
               Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans
               or when required by law, and (d) the Affected Loans shall
               automatically convert into Base Rate Loans at the end of the then
               current Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans or when or if
               required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a
               determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates to
               a LIBOR Loan then being requested by Borrower pursuant to a
               Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation,
               Borrower shall have the option, subject to the provisions of
               Subsection F3, to rescind such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
               Conversion/Continuation as to all Lenders by giving notice (by
               telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to
               Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which the
               Affected Lender gives notice of its determination as described
               above (which notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall
               promptly transmit to each other Lender). Except as provided in
               the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Subsection
               II.G.3 shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an
               Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans
               to, LIBOR Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          3.   Compensation For Breakage or Non-Commencement of Interest
               Periods. Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon written
               request by that Lender (which request shall set forth the basis
               for requesting such amounts) pursuant to Subsection H, for all
               reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any
               interest paid by that Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it
               to make or carry its LIBOR Loans and any loss, expense or
               liability sustained by that Lender in connection with the
               liquidation or re-

               employment of such funds) which that Lender may sustain: (i) if
               for any reason (other than a default by that Lender) a borrowing
               of any LIBOR Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in
               a Notice of Borrowing or a telephonic request for borrowing, or a
               conversion to or continuation of any LIBOR Loan does not occur on
               a date specified therefor in a Notice of Conversion/Continuation
               or a telephonic request for conversion or continuation, (ii) if
               any prepayment or other principal payment or any conversion of
               any of its LIBOR Loans (including any prepayment described in
               Subsection II.D.2.a or conversion occasioned by the circumstances
               described in Subsection F2) occurs on a date prior to the last
               day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan, (iii) if any
               prepayment of any of its LIBOR Loans is not made on any date
               specified in a notice of prepayment given by Borrower, or (iv) as
               a consequence of any other default by Borrower in the repayment
               of its LIBOR Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement;
               provided, however, that Borrower shall have no obligation to make
               any payment to any demanding party under this Subsection on
               account of any such increased costs or reduced amounts unless
               Borrower receives notice of such increased costs or reduced
               amounts within one hundred eighty (180) days after such Lender is
               able to determine the amount of such costs or amounts,
               accompanied by a certificate executed by an officer of the
               applicable Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
               and calculation of the amount of such costs or amounts, which
               certificate shall constitute prima facie evidence of such costs
               or amounts.

          4.   Booking of LIBOR Loans. Any Lender may make, carry or transfer
               LIBOR Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch
               offices or the office of an Affiliate of that Lender.

          5.   Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Loans. Calculation of all
               amounts payable to a Lender under this Subsection F and under
               Subsection G.1 shall be made as though that Lender had actually
               funded each of its relevant LIBOR Loans through the purchase of a
               Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant
               to clause (i) of the definition of Adjusted LIBOR in an amount
               equal to the amount of such LIBOR Loan and having a maturity
               comparable to the relevant Interest Period, whether or not its
               LIBOR Loans had actually been funded in such manner and through
               the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office
               of that Lender to a domestic office of that Lender in the United
               States of America; provided, however, that each Lender may fund
               each of its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the
               foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for the purposes of
               calculating amounts payable under this Subsection F and under
               Subsection G.1.

          6.   LIBOR Loans After Default. After the occurrence of and during the
               continuation of a Potential Event of Default or an Event of
               Default,

                                       55

<PAGE>

               (i) Borrower may not elect to have a Loan be made or maintained
               as, or converted to, a LIBOR Loan after the expiration of any
               Interest Period then in effect for that Loan and (ii) subject to
               the provisions of Subsection II.F.3, any Notice of Borrowing or
               Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by Borrower with respect
               to a requested borrowing or conversion/continuation that has not
               yet occurred shall be deemed to be rescinded by Borrower.

     G.   Increased Costs; Taxes; Capital Adequacy.
          ----------------------------------------

          1.   Compensation for Increased Costs and Taxes. Subject to the
               provisions of Subsection II.G.2 (which shall be controlling with
               respect to the matters covered thereby), if any Lender (including
               any Issuing Lender) shall determine (which determination shall
               constitute prima facie evidence of such matters) that any law,
               treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change
               therein or in the interpretation, administration or application
               thereof (including the introduction of any new law, treaty or
               governmental rule, regulation or order), or any determination of
               a court or Government Authority, in each case that becomes
               effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender
               with any guideline, request or directive issued or made after the
               date hereof by any central bank or other Government Authority or
               quasi-Government Authority (whether or not having the force of
               law):

               a.   subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending office) to
                    any additional Tax with respect to this Agreement or any of
                    its obligations hereunder (including with respect to issuing
                    or maintaining any Letters of Credit or purchasing or
                    maintaining any participations therein or maintaining any
                    Commitment hereunder) or any payments to such Lender (or its
                    applicable lending office) of principal, interest, fees or
                    any other amount payable hereunder;

               b.   imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including
                    any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other
                    reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge
                    or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits
                    or other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances
                    or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
                    acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other
                    than any such reserve or other requirements with respect to
                    LIBOR Loans that are reflected in the definition of Adjusted
                    LIBOR); or

               c.   imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a
                    Tax matter) on or affecting such Lender (or its applicable
                    lending office) or its obligations hereunder or the
                    interbank Eurodollar market;

                                       56

<PAGE>

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make, making or maintaining its Loans or Commitments or agreeing to
issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to purchase,
purchasing or maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any amount
received or receivable by such Lender (or its applicable lending office) with
respect thereto; then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay to such
Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the proviso below, such
additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a
different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its
sole but reasonable discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to
compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts
received or receivable hereunder; provided, however, that Borrower shall have no
obligation to make any payment to any demanding party under this Subsection on
account of any such increased costs unless Borrower receives notice of such
increased costs within one hundred eighty (180) days after such Lender is able
to determine the amount of such costs, accompanied by a certificate executed by
an officer of the applicable Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
and calculation of the amount of such costs, which certificate shall constitute
prima facie evidence of such costs.

          2.   Withholding of Taxes.

               a.   Payments to Be Free and Clear. Unless otherwise required by
                    applicable law, all sums payable by Borrower under this
                    Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be paid free
                    and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on
                    account of, any Tax imposed, levied, collected, withheld or
                    assessed by or within the United States of America or any
                    political subdivision in or of the United States of America
                    or any other jurisdiction from or to which a payment is made
                    by or on behalf of Borrower or by any federation or
                    organization of which the United States of America or any
                    such jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment.

               b.   Grossing-up of Payments. If Borrower or any other Person is
                    required by law to make any deduction or withholding on
                    account of any such Tax from any sum paid or payable by
                    Borrower to Administrative Agent or any Lender under any of
                    the Loan Documents:

                    (1)  Borrower shall notify Administrative Agent of any such
                         requirement or any change in any such requirement as
                         soon as Borrower becomes aware of it;

                    (2)  Borrower shall pay any such Tax when such Tax is due,
                         regardless of whether the liability for payment of such
                         Tax (i) is imposed on Borrower itself, Administrative
                         Agent or any Lender or (ii) relates to any portion of
                         any sums paid or payable to any Lender under any of the
                         Loan Documents

                                       57

<PAGE>

                         with respect to which such Lender does not act for its
                         own account;

                    (3)  the sum payable by Borrower in respect of which the
                         relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required
                         shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure
                         that, after the making of that deduction, withholding
                         or payment, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the
                         case may be, receives on the due date a net sum equal
                         to what it would have received had no such deduction,
                         withholding or payment been required or made; and

                    (4)  within thirty (30) days after paying any sum from which
                         it is required by law to make any deduction or
                         withholding, and within 30 days after the due date of
                         payment of any Tax which it is required by clause (b)
                         above to pay, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative
                         Agent and/or other affected parties evidence
                         satisfactory to the other affected parties of such
                         deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance
                         thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority;

     provided that (i) no such additional amount shall be required to be paid to
     any Lender under clause (c) above to the extent such additional amount
     relates to a portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any
     of the Loan Documents with respect to which such Lender does not act for
     its own account and (ii) where any change after the date such Lender became
     a Lender in any such requirement for a deduction, withholding or payment as
     is mentioned therein results in an increase in the rate of such deduction,
     withholding or payment from that in effect at the date on which such Lender
     became a Lender, the resulting additional amount to be paid to such Lender
     under clause (c) above shall be limited to the amount by which such
     increase in rate increases the amount of any such required deduction,
     withholding or payment.

               c.   Evidence of Exemption from or Reduction of U.S. Withholding
                    Tax.

                    (1)  Each Lender that is organized under the laws of any
                         jurisdiction other than the United States or any state
                         or other political subdivision thereof (for purposes of
                         this Subsection GB(iii), a "Non-US Lender") shall
                         deliver to Administrative Agent and to Borrower, on or
                         prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each Lender
                         listed on the signature pages hereof) or on or prior to
                         the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which
                         it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender),
                         and at such other times as may be necessary in the
                         determination of

<PAGE>

                         Borrower or Administrative Agent (each in the
                         reasonable exercise of its discretion), two original
                         copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
                         W-8ECI (or any successor forms) properly completed and
                         duly executed by such Non-US Lender, or, in the case of
                         a Non-US Lender claiming exemption from United States
                         federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c)
                         of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to payments
                         of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8BEN, and, in the
                         case of a Non-US Lender that has certified in writing
                         to Administrative Agent that it is not a "bank" (as
                         defined in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue
                         Code), a certificate (the "Certificate re: Non-Bank
                         Status") of such Non-US Lender certifying that such
                         Non-US Lender is not (i) a "bank" for purposes of
                         Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) a
                         ten-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section
                         871(h)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code) of Borrower,
                         or (iii) a controlled foreign corporation related to
                         Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of
                         the Internal Revenue Code) in all such cases together
                         with any other certificate or statement of exemption
                         required under the Internal Revenue Code or the
                         regulations issued thereunder to establish that such
                         Non-US Lender is not subject to United States
                         withholding tax with respect to any payments to such
                         Non-US Lender of interest payable under any of the Loan
                         Documents.

                    (2)  Each Non-US Lender, to the extent it does not act or
                         ceases to act for its own account with respect to any
                         portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender
                         under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the
                         case of a typical participation by such Lender), shall
                         deliver to Administrative Agent and to Borrower, on or
                         prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each Non-US
                         Lender listed on the signature pages hereof), on or
                         prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant
                         to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other
                         Non-US Lender), or on such later date when such Non-US
                         Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect
                         to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at
                         such other times as may be necessary in the
                         determination of Borrower or Administrative Agent (each
                         in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (1) two
                         original copies of the forms or statements required to
                         be provided by such Non-US Lender under Subsection
                         2.7B(iii)(a), properly completed and duly

<PAGE>

                         executed by such Non-US Lender, to establish the
                         portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect
                         to which such Non-US Lender acts for its own account
                         that is not subject to United States withholding tax,
                         and (2) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service
                         Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) properly completed
                         and duly executed by such Non-US Lender, together with
                         any information, if any, such Non-US Lender chooses to
                         transmit with such form, and any other certificate or
                         statement of exemption required under the Internal
                         Revenue Code or the regulations issued thereunder, to
                         establish that such Non-US Lender is not acting for its
                         own account with respect to a portion of any such sums
                         payable to such Non-US Lender.

                    (3)  Each Non-US Lender hereby agrees, from time to time
                         after the initial delivery by such Non-US Lender of
                         such forms, whenever a lapse in time or change in
                         circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other
                         evidence so delivered obsolete or inaccurate in any
                         material respect or if, by virtue of a change in law or
                         regulations, such forms are no longer valid evidence of
                         a person's exemption from withholding tax which is
                         reasonably satisfactory to Borrower, that such Non-US
                         Lender shall promptly (1) deliver to Administrative
                         Agent and to Borrower two original copies of renewals,
                         amendments or additional or successor forms, properly
                         completed and duly executed by such Non-US Lender,
                         together with any other certificate or statement of
                         exemption required in order to confirm or establish
                         that such Non-US Lender is not subject to United States
                         withholding tax with respect to payments to such Non-US
                         Lender under the Loan Documents and, if applicable,
                         that such Non-US Lender does not act for its own
                         account with respect to any portion of any such
                         payments, or (2) notify Administrative Agent and
                         Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms,
                         certificates or other evidence.

                    (4)  Upon written request of Borrower stating the reasons
                         for such request, each Non-US Lender hereby agrees to
                         provide, with respect to any sums payable under this
                         Agreement, such additional forms, certificates,
                         statements of exemption or other documentation;
                         provided that this obligation shall not apply unless
                         Borrower establishes to the satisfaction of such Non-US
                         Lender that (i) Borrower is

                                       60

<PAGE>

                         required by law to make a deduction or withholding on
                         account of any Tax imposed by a jurisdiction other than
                         the United States of America or any political
                         subdivision in or of the United States of America, (ii)
                         such deduction or withholding will be reduced or
                         eliminated at no cost to such Non-US Lender if such
                         Non-US Lender provides such form, certificate,
                         statement of exemption or other documentation, and
                         (iii) providing such form, certificate, statement of
                         exemption or other documentation, will not require
                         disclosure of any confidential information to any
                         Person.

                    (5)  Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional
                         amount to any Non-US Lender under clause (c) of
                         Subsection GB(ii) if such Non-US Lender shall have
                         failed to satisfy the requirements of clause (a), (b),
                         (c)(1) or (d) of this Subsection GB(iii); provided that
                         if such Non-US Lender shall have satisfied the
                         requirements of Subsection GB(iii)(a) on the date such
                         Non-US Lender became a Lender or Subsection
                         2.7B(iii)(d) upon Borrower's initial written request,
                         nothing in this Subsection GB(iii)(e) shall relieve
                         Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant
                         to Subsection GB(ii)(c) if, as a result of any change
                         in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule,
                         regulation or order, or any change in the
                         interpretation, administration or application thereof,
                         such Non-US Lender is no longer properly entitled to
                         deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
                         subsequent date establishing the fact that such Non-US
                         Lender is not subject to or subject only to partial
                         withholding as described in Subsections GB(iii)(a) and
                         (d).

          3.   Capital Adequacy Adjustment. If any Lender shall have determined
               that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after
               the date hereof of any law, rule or regulation (or any provision
               thereof) regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or in
               the interpretation or administration thereof by any Government
               Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
               interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
               Lender (or its applicable lending office) with any guideline,
               request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
               having the force of law) of any such Government Authority,
               central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect
               of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or
               any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or
               with reference to, such Lender's Loans or Commitments or Letters
               of Credit or participations therein or other

                                       61

<PAGE>

               obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or the Letters of
               Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such
               controlling corporation could have achieved but for such
               adoption, effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or
               compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender
               or such controlling corporation with regard to capital adequacy),
               then from time to time, within five Business Days after receipt
               by Borrower from such Lender of the statement referred to in the
               next sentence, Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
               amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
               controlling corporation on an after-tax basis for such reduction;
               provided, however, that Borrower shall have no obligation to make
               any payment to any demanding party under this Subsection on
               account of any such increased costs unless Borrower receives
               notice of such increased costs within one hundred eighty (180)
               days after such Lender is able to determine the amount of such
               costs, accompanied by a certificate executed by an officer of the
               applicable Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
               and calculation of the amount of such costs, which certificate
               shall constitute prima facie evidence of such costs.

     H.   Obligation of Lenders and Issuing Lenders to Mitigate.
          -----------------------------------------------------

          Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable
after the officer of such Lender or Issuing Lender responsible for administering
the Loans or Letters of Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may
be, becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition
that would cause such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle
such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive payments under Subsection II.G or
Subsection III.F, it will, to the extent not inconsistent with the internal
policies of such Lender or Issuing Lender and any applicable legal or regulatory
restrictions, use reasonable efforts (i) to make, issue, fund or maintain the
Commitments of such Lender or the affected Loans or Letters of Credit of such
Lender or Issuing Lender through another lending or letter of credit office of
such Lender or Issuing Lender, or (ii) take such other measures as such Lender
or Issuing Lender may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances
which would cause such Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or
the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to such
Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to Subsection II.G or Subsection III.F would
be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender or Issuing Lender in
its sole but reasonable discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining
of such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit through such other lending or
letter of credit office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case
may be, would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or Issuing Lender
or materially adversely affect such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit or
the interests of such Lender or Issuing Lender; provided that such Lender or
Issuing Lender will not be obligated to utilize such other lending or letter of
credit office pursuant to this Subsection II.H unless Borrower agrees to pay all
incremental expenses incurred by such Lender or Issuing Lender as a result of
utilizing such other lending or letter of credit office as described in clause
(i) above. A certificate as to the amount of any such expenses payable by
Borrower pursuant to this

                                       62

<PAGE>

Subsection II.H (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting
such amount) submitted by such Lender or Issuing Lender to Borrower (with a copy
to Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     I.   Replacement of a Lender
          -----------------------

          If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or an Affected Lender (any
such Lender, a "Subject Lender"), so long as (i) no Potential Event of Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and Borrower has
obtained a commitment from another Lender or an Eligible Assignee to purchase at
par the Subject Lender's Loans and assume the Subject Lender's Commitments and
all other obligations of the Subject Lender hereunder, (ii) such Lender is not
an Issuing Lender with respect to any Letters of Credit outstanding (unless all
such Letters of Credit are terminated or arrangements acceptable to such Issuing
Lender (such as a "back-to-back" letter of credit) are made) and (iii), if
applicable, the Subject Lender is unwilling to remedy its default or withholds
any request for reimbursement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to the
Subject Lender and Administrative Agent, Borrower may require the Subject Lender
to assign all of its Loans and Commitments to such other Lender, Lenders,
Eligible Assignee or Eligible Assignees pursuant to the provisions of Subsection
10.1B; provided that, prior to or concurrently with such replacement, (1) the
Subject Lender shall have received payment in full of all principal, interest,
fees and other amounts (including all amounts under Subsections 2.6D, 2.7 and/or
2.8 (if applicable)) through such date of replacement and a release from its
obligations under the Loan Documents, (2) the processing fee required to be paid
by Subsection 10.1B(i) shall have been paid to Administrative Agent, and (3) all
of the requirements for such assignment contained in Subsection 10.1B,
including, without limitation, the consent of Administrative Agent (if required)
and the receipt by Administrative Agent of an executed Assignment Agreement and
other supporting documents, have been fulfilled; and provided further, that if
Borrower seeks to exercise such right, Borrower must do so within sixty (60)
days after Borrower first knows or should have known of the occurrence of the
event or events giving rise to such right.

III. LETTERS OF CREDIT

     A.   Issuance of Letters of Credit and Revolving Lenders' Purchase of
          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          Participations Therein.
          ----------------------

          D.   Letters of Credit. In addition to Borrower requesting that
Lenders make Revolving Loans pursuant to Subsection II.A.b, Borrower may
request, in accordance with the provisions of this Subsection III.A, from time
to time during the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the 30th day
prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, that one or more
Revolving Lenders issue Letters of Credit for the account of Borrower for the
purposes specified in the definition of Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and
warranties of Borrower herein set forth, any one or more Revolving Lenders may,
but (except as provided in Subsection III.A.2.c) shall not be obligated to,
issue such Letters of Credit in accordance with the provisions of this
Subsection III.A; provided that Borrower shall not request that any Revolving
Lender issue (and no Revolving Lender shall issue):

                                       63

<PAGE>

               a.   any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
                    issuance, the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan
                    Commitments would exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments then
                    in effect;

               b.   any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
                    issuance, the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed
                    $25,000,000;

               c.   any Letter of Credit having an expiration date later than
                    the earlier of (a) ten days prior to the Revolving Loan
                    Commitment Termination Date and (b) the date which is one
                    year from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit;
                    provided that the immediately preceding clause (b) shall not
                    prevent any Issuing Lender (but subject to clause (a) above)
                    from agreeing that a Letter of Credit will automatically be
                    extended for one or more successive periods not to exceed
                    one year each unless such Issuing Lender elects not to
                    extend for any such additional period; and provided, further
                    that such Issuing Lender shall elect not to extend such
                    Letter of Credit if it has knowledge that an Event of
                    Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred and is
                    continuing (and has not been waived in accordance with
                    Subsection X.F) at the time such Issuing Lender must elect
                    whether or not to allow such extension;

               d.   any Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than
                    Dollars; or

               e.   any Letter of Credit with a face amount of less than
                    $10,000; or

               f.   any Letter of Credit that violates applicable law or any
                    policy of the applicable Issuing Lender relating to the
                    issuance of Letters of Credit.

          2.   Mechanics of Issuance.

               a.   Request for Issuance. Whenever Borrower desires the issuance
                    of a Letter of Credit, it shall deliver to Administrative
                    Agent a Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit
                    substantially in the form of Exhibit III annexed hereto no
                    later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) at least three
                    Business Days, or in each case such shorter period as may be
                    agreed to by the applicable Issuing Lender in any particular
                    instance, in advance of the proposed date of issuance. The
                    Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit shall specify (a)
                    the proposed date of issuance (which shall be a Business
                    Day), (b) the face amount of the Letter of Credit, (c) the
                    expiration date of the Letter of Credit, (d) the name and
                    address of the beneficiary, and (e) either the verbatim text
                    of the proposed Letter of Credit or the proposed terms and
                    conditions thereof, including a precise

                                       64

<PAGE>

                    description of any documents to be presented by the
                    beneficiary which, if presented by the beneficiary prior to
                    the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, would require
                    the Issuing Lender thereof to make payment under the Letter
                    of Credit and in the event CIBC is the Issuing Lender, such
                    Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit shall attach a
                    current application form from CIBC with respect to the
                    issuance of such Letter of Credit; provided that the Issuing
                    Lender, in its reasonable discretion, may require changes in
                    the text of the proposed Letter of Credit or any such
                    documents; and provided, further that no Letter of Credit
                    shall require payment against a conforming draft to be made
                    thereunder on the same Business Day (under the laws of the
                    jurisdiction in which the office of the Issuing Lender to
                    which such draft is required to be presented is located)
                    that such draft is presented if such presentation is made
                    after 10:00 a.m. (in the time zone of such office of the
                    Issuing Lender) on such Business Day.

               b.   Update of Certifications. Borrower shall notify the
                    applicable Issuing Lender (and Administrative Agent, if
                    Administrative Agent is not such Issuing Lender) prior to
                    the issuance of any Letter of Credit if any of the matters
                    to which Borrower is required to certify in the applicable
                    Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit is no longer true
                    and correct as of the proposed date of issuance of such
                    Letter of Credit, and upon the issuance of any Letter of
                    Credit Borrower shall be deemed to have re-certified, as of
                    the date of such issuance, as to the matters to which
                    Borrower is required to certify in the applicable Request
                    for Issuance of Letter of Credit.

               c.   Determination of Issuing Lender. Upon receipt by
                    Administrative Agent of a Request for Issuance of Letter of
                    Credit pursuant to Subsection III.A.2.a requesting the
                    issuance of a Letter of Credit, if Administrative Agent
                    elects to issue such Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent
                    shall promptly so notify Borrower, and Administrative Agent
                    shall be the Issuing Lender with respect thereto. If
                    Administrative Agent, in its sole but reasonable discretion,
                    elects not to issue such Letter of Credit, Administrative
                    Agent shall promptly so notify Borrower, whereupon Borrower
                    may request any other Revolving Lender to issue such Letter
                    of Credit by delivering to such Revolving Lender a copy of
                    the applicable Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit. Any
                    Revolving Lender so requested to issue such Letter of Credit
                    shall promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent
                    whether or not, in its sole but reasonable discretion, it
                    has elected to issue such Letter of Credit, and any such
                    Revolving Lender that so elects to

                                       65

<PAGE>

                    issue such Letter of Credit shall be the Issuing Lender with
                    respect thereto.

               d.   Issuance of Letter of Credit. Upon satisfaction or waiver
                    (in accordance with Subsection X.F) of the conditions set
                    forth in Subsection IV.C, the applicable Issuing Lender
                    shall issue the requested Letter of Credit in accordance
                    with such Issuing Lender's standard operating procedures.

               e.   Notification to Lenders. Upon the issuance of or amendment
                    to any Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender shall
                    promptly notify Administrative Agent of such issuance or
                    amendment. Promptly after receipt of such notice (or, if
                    Administrative Agent is the Issuing Lender, together with
                    such notice), Administrative Agent shall notify each
                    Revolving Lender of the amount of such Revolving Lender's
                    respective participation in such Letter of Credit,
                    determined in accordance with Subsection III.A.3.

          3.   Lenders' Purchase of Participations in Letters of Credit.
               Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
               Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have
               irrevocably purchased from the Issuing Lender a participation in
               such Letter of Credit and any drawings honored thereunder in an
               amount equal to such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
               maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be
               drawn thereunder.

     B.   Letter of Credit Fees.
          ---------------------

          Borrower agrees to pay the following amounts with respect to Letters
of Credit issued hereunder:

               a.   with respect to each Letter of Credit, (a) a fronting fee,
                    payable to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
                    applicable Issuing Lender for its own account, equal to
                    0.25% per annum of the daily amount available to be drawn
                    under such Letter of Credit, and (b) a letter of credit fee,
                    payable to Administrative Agent for the account of Revolving
                    Lenders, equal to the Applicable LIBOR Margin for Revolving
                    Loans multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn
                    under such Letter of Credit, each such fronting fee or
                    letter of credit fee to be payable in arrears on the last
                    Business Day of each March, June, September and December of
                    each Fiscal Year, commencing on the first such date to occur
                    after the Closing Date, and computed on the basis of a
                    360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed; and

                                       66

<PAGE>

               b.   with respect to the issuance, amendment or transfer of each
                    Letter of Credit and each payment of a drawing made
                    thereunder (without duplication of the fees payable under
                    clause (i) above), documentary and processing charges
                    payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its
                    own account in accordance with such Issuing Lender's
                    standard schedule for such charges in effect at the time of
                    such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case
                    may be.

For purposes of calculating any fees payable under clauses (i) and (ii) of this
Subsection III.B, the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of
Credit shall be determined as of the close of business on any date of
determination. Promptly upon receipt by Administrative Agent of any amount
described in clause (i) or (ii) of this Subsection III.B, Administrative Agent
shall distribute to each Revolving Lender its Pro Rata Share of such amount.

     C.   Drawings and Reimbursement of Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.
          ------------------------------------------------------------------

          E.   Responsibility of Issuing Lender With Respect to Drawings. In
determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to examine the
documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care so as to
ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms
and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

          1.   Reimbursement by Borrower of Amounts Paid Under Letters of
               Credit. If an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing
               under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall
               immediately notify Borrower and Administrative Agent, and
               Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender on the date on which
               such drawing is honored (the "Reimbursement Date") in an amount
               in Dollars and in same day funds equal to the amount of such
               honored drawing plus interest thereon as provided in Subsection
               C3.a for the period from the date of drawing to the date on which
               such Revolving Loans are made (the "LC Reimbursement Amount");
               provided that, anything contained in this Agreement to the
               contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless Borrower shall have notified
               Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender prior to 1:00 P.M.
               (New York City time) on the date such drawing is honored that
               Borrower intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the LC
               Reimbursement Amount with funds other than the proceeds of
               Revolving Loans, Borrower shall be deemed to have given a timely
               Notice of Borrowing to Administrative Agent requesting Revolving
               Lenders to make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the
               Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars equal to the LC
               Reimbursement Amount (and Administrative Agent shall promptly
               give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender) and (ii) subject to
               satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in Subsection
               IV.B.1, Revolving Lenders shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make
               Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans in an amount equal to
               the

                                       67

<PAGE>

               LC Reimbursement Amount, the proceeds of which shall be applied
               directly by Administrative Agent to reimburse such Issuing Lender
               in an amount equal to the LC Reimbursement Amount; and provided,
               further that if for any reason proceeds of Revolving Loans are
               not received by Administrative Agent on the Reimbursement Date in
               an amount equal to the LC Reimbursement Amount, Borrower shall
               reimburse Administrative Agent, on demand, in an amount in same
               day funds equal to the excess of (x) the LC Reimbursement Amount
               over (y) the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans, if any,
               which are so received. Nothing in this Subsection III.C.1 shall
               be deemed to relieve any Revolving Lender from its obligation to
               make Revolving Loans on the terms and conditions set forth in
               this Agreement, and Borrower shall retain any and all rights it
               may have against any Revolving Lender resulting from the failure
               of such Revolving Lender to make such Revolving Loans under this
               Subsection III.C.1. The Issuing Lender may honor or dishonor any
               drawing in accordance with the terms of any Letter of Credit
               without regard to any instruction of Borrower.

          2.   Payment by Revolving Lenders of Unreimbursed Amounts Paid Under
               Letters of Credit.

               a.   Payment by Revolving Lenders. If Borrower shall fail for any
                    reason to reimburse any Issuing Lender (or Administrative
                    Agent) as provided in Subsection III.C.1 in an amount equal
                    to the amount of any drawing honored by such Issuing Lender
                    under a Letter of Credit issued by it, Administrative Agent
                    shall promptly notify each other Revolving Lender of the
                    unreimbursed amount of such honored drawing and of such
                    other Revolving Lender's respective participation therein
                    based on such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
                    Revolving Loan Commitment by telefacsimile or by telephone
                    promptly confirmed by telefacsimile. Each Revolving Lender
                    shall make available to Administrative Agent for the account
                    of such Issuing Lender an amount equal to its respective
                    participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the
                    Administrative Agent's Office, not later than 2:00 P.M. (New
                    York City time) on the Business Day notified by
                    Administrative Agent. If any Revolving Lender fails to make
                    available to Administrative Agent for the account of such
                    Issuing Lender on such Business Day the amount of such
                    Revolving Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit as
                    provided in this Subsection III.C.2, Administrative Agent
                    and/or such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such
                    amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with
                    interest thereon at the rate customarily used by such
                    Issuing Lender for the correction of errors among banks for
                    three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. Nothing
                    in this

                                       68

<PAGE>

                    Subsection III.C.2 shall be deemed to prejudice the right of
                    any Revolving Lender to recover from any Issuing Lender any
                    amounts made available by such Revolving Lender to such
                    Issuing Lender pursuant to this Subsection III.C.2 if it is
                    determined by the final non-appealable judgment of a court
                    of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a
                    Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender in respect of which
                    payment was made by such Issuing Lender constituted gross
                    negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing
                    Lender.

               b.   Distribution to Revolving Lenders of Reimbursements Received
                    From Borrower. If Administrative Agent for the account of
                    any Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by other
                    Revolving Lenders pursuant to Subsection III.C.2.a for all
                    or any portion of any drawing honored by such Issuing Lender
                    under a Letter of Credit issued by it, Administrative Agent
                    shall promptly distribute to each other Revolving Lender
                    that has paid all amounts payable by it under Subsection
                    III.C.2.a with respect to such honored drawing such other
                    Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan
                    Commitment of all payments subsequently received by
                    Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender
                    from Borrower in reimbursement of such honored drawing when
                    such payments are received. Any such distribution shall be
                    made to a Revolving Lender at its primary address set forth
                    below its name in the Register or at such other address or
                    such account as such Revolving Lender may request.

          3.   Interest on Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.

               a.   Payment of Interest by Borrower. Borrower agrees to pay to
                    Administrative Agent for the account of each Issuing Lender,
                    with respect to drawings honored under any Letters of Credit
                    issued by it, interest on the amount paid by such Issuing
                    Lender in respect of each such honored drawing from the date
                    a drawing is honored to but excluding the date such amount
                    is reimbursed by Borrower (including any such reimbursement
                    out of the proceeds of Revolving Loans pursuant to
                    Subsection III.C.1) at a rate equal to (a) for the period
                    from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the
                    Reimbursement Date, the rate then in effect under this
                    Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate
                    Loans and (b) thereafter, a rate that is 2.00% per annum in
                    excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable under this
                    Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate
                    Loans. Interest payable pursuant to this Subsection
                    III.C.3.a shall be computed on the basis of a 365/366-day
                    year (as applicable), for the actual number of days elapsed
                    in the period during which it accrues and

                                       69

<PAGE>

                    shall be payable on demand or, if no demand is made, on the
                    date on which the related drawing under a Letter of Credit
                    is reimbursed in full.

               b.   Distribution of Interest Payments by Administrative Agent.
                    Promptly upon receipt by Administrative Agent for the
                    account of any Issuing Lender of any payment of interest
                    pursuant to Subsection III.C.3.a with respect to a drawing
                    honored under a Letter of Credit issued by it, (a)
                    Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Revolving
                    Lender, out of the interest received by Administrative Agent
                    in respect of the period from the date such drawing is
                    honored to but excluding the date on which such Issuing
                    Lender is reimbursed for the amount of such honored drawing
                    (including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of
                    Revolving Loans pursuant to Subsection III.C.1), the amount
                    that such other Revolving Lender would have been entitled to
                    receive in respect of the letter of credit fee that would
                    have been payable in respect of such Letter of Credit for
                    such period pursuant to Subsection III.B if no drawing had
                    been honored under such Letter of Credit, and (b) if such
                    Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by Revolving
                    Lenders pursuant to Subsection III.C.2.a for all or any
                    portion of such honored drawing, such Issuing Lender shall
                    pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each such
                    Revolving Lender that has paid all amounts payable by it
                    under Subsection III.C.2.a with respect to such honored
                    drawing such other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
                    Revolving Loan Commitment of any interest received by such
                    Issuing Lender in respect of that portion of such honored
                    drawing so reimbursed by Revolving Lenders for the period
                    from the date on which such Issuing Lender was so reimbursed
                    by Revolving Lenders to but excluding the date on which such
                    portion of such honored drawing is reimbursed by Borrower.
                    Any such distribution shall be made to a Revolving Lender at
                    its primary address set forth in the Register or at such
                    other address as such Revolving Lender may request.

     D.   Obligations Absolute.
          --------------------

          The obligation of Borrower to reimburse each Issuing Lender (or
Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender) for drawings
honored under the Letters of Credit issued by it and to repay any Revolving
Loans made by Revolving Lenders pursuant to Subsection III.C.1 and the
obligations of Revolving Lenders under Subsection III.C.2.a shall be
unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the

                                       70

<PAGE>

               b.   the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
                    which Borrower or any Revolving Lender may have at any time
                    against a beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of
                    Credit (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be
                    acting), any Issuing Lender or other Lender or any other
                    Person or, in the case of a Lender, against Borrower,
                    whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
                    contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including
                    any underlying transaction between Borrower or any of its
                    Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for which any Letter of
                    Credit was procured);

               c.   any draft or other document presented under any Letter of
                    Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
                    insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
                    untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

               d.   payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under any Letter of
                    Credit against presentation of a draft or other document
                    which does not substantially comply with the terms of such
                    Letter of Credit;

               e.   any adverse change in the business, operations, properties,
                    assets, financial condition or prospects of Borrower or any
                    of its Subsidiaries;

               f.   any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by

willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender under the circumstances in question
(as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction).

     E.   Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties.
          --------------------------------------------------

disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which such
Person may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i)
the

issuance or honoring of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender, other than
as a result of (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing
Lender as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction or (b) subject to the following clause (ii), the wrongful dishonor
by such Issuing Lender of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of
Credit issued by it or (ii) the failure of such Issuing Lender to honor a
drawing under any such Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission,
whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto
Government Authority (all such acts or omissions herein called "Governmental
Acts").

          1.   Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties. As between Borrower and any
               Issuing Lender, Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and
               omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by such
               Issuing Lender by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters
               of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
               such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for: (i) the form,
               validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of
               any document submitted by any party in connection with the
               application for and issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even
               if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
               insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity
               or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
               purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the
               rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
               part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any
               reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of
               Credit to comply fully with any conditions required in order to
               draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions,
               interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
               messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether
               or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of
               technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or
               otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing
               under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii)
               the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of
               Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of
               Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the
               control of such Issuing Lender, including any Governmental Acts,
               and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the
               vesting of, any of such Issuing Lender's or any other Lender's
               rights or powers hereunder.

          In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific
provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this Subsection III.E.1, any
action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with the
Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered
thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender
or any other Lender under any resulting liability to Borrower.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Subsection
III.E, Borrower shall retain any and all rights it may have against any Issuing
Lender for any liability to the extent arising out of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender, as determined by a final
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

     F.   Increased Costs and Taxes Relating to Letters of Credit.
          -------------------------------------------------------

          Subject to the provisions of Subsection II.G.2 (which shall be
controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby), if any Issuing Lender
or Revolving Lender shall determine (which determination shall constitute prima
facie evidence of such matters) that any law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation or order, or any change therein or in the interpretation,
administration or application thereof (including the introduction of any new
law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order), or any determination of
a court or Government Authority, in each case that becomes effective after the
date hereof, or compliance by any Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender with any
guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date hereof by any
central bank or other Government Authority or quasi-Government Authority
(whether or not having the force of law):

               a.   subjects such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender (or its
                    applicable lending or letter of credit office) to any
                    additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income
                    of such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender) with respect to
                    the issuing or maintaining of any Letters of Credit or the
                    purchasing or maintaining of any participations therein or
                    any other obligations under this III, whether directly or by
                    such being imposed on or suffered by any particular Issuing
                    Lender;

               b.   imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including
                    any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other
                    reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance
                    or similar requirement in respect of any Letters of Credit
                    issued by any Issuing Lender or participations therein
                    purchased by any Revolving Lender; or

               c.   imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a
                    Tax matter) on or affecting such Issuing Lender or Revolving
                    Lender (or its applicable lending or letter of credit
                    office) regarding this III or any Letter of Credit or any
                    participation therein;

          and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender of agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining
any Letter of Credit or agreeing to purchase, purchasing or maintaining any
participation therein or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such
Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender (or its applicable lending or letter of
credit office) with respect thereto; then, in any case, Borrower shall promptly
pay to such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender, upon receipt of the statement
referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts as may be
necessary to compensate such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender for any such
increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such
Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender shall deliver to Borrower a written
statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the
additional amounts owed to such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender under this
Subsection III.F, which statement shall constitute prima facie evidence of such
additional amounts.

          9.   Evidence of Insurance. Administrative Agent shall have received a
               certificate from Borrower's insurance broker or other evidence

               to it that all insurance required to be maintained pursuant to
               Subsection VI.D is in full force and effect and that
               Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders has been named as
               additional insured and/or loss payee thereunder to the extent
               required under Subsection VI.D.

               each case that are reasonably necessary in connection with the
               transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and the continued
               operation of the business conducted by Borrower and its
               Subsidiaries in substantially the same manner as conducted by
               Borrower prior to the Closing Date. Each such Governmental
               Authorization or consent shall be in full force and effect,
               except in a case where the failure to obtain or maintain a
               Governmental Authorization or consent, either individually or in
               the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
               Material Adverse Effect. All applicable waiting periods shall
               have expired without any action being taken or threatened by any
               competent authority that would restrain, prevent or otherwise
               impose adverse conditions on the transactions contemplated by the
               Loan Documents. No action, request for stay, petition for review
               or rehearing, reconsideration, or appeal with respect to any of
               the foregoing shall be pending, and the time for any applicable
               Government Authority to take action to set aside its consent on
               its own motion shall have expired.

          11.  [Reserved]

               not otherwise satisfied pursuant to Subsection IV.A.13,

               it that Borrower and Subsidiary Guarantors shall have taken or
               caused to be taken all such actions, executed and delivered or
               caused to be executed and delivered all such agreements,
               documents and instruments, and made or caused to be made all such
               filings and recordings (other than the filing or recording of
               items described in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) below) that may
               be reasonably necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of
               Administrative Agent, desirable in order to create in favor of
               Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, a valid and
               (upon such filing and recording) perfected First Priority Lien in
               the entire personal and mixed property Collateral, other than
               certain Intellectual Property. Such actions shall include the

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization as specified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto. Each
Loan Party has all requisite corporate power and authority to own and operate
its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted, to enter into the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to carry
out the transactions contemplated thereby.

          1.   Qualification and Good Standing. Each Loan Party is qualified to
               do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction where its
               assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out its
               business and operations, except in jurisdictions where the
               failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had and
               could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
               Effect.

          2.   Conduct of Business. Borrower and its Subsidiaries are engaged
               only in the businesses permitted to be engaged in pursuant to

               duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
               laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization set forth
               therein, has all requisite power and authority to own and operate
               its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and
               as proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Loan Documents to
               which it is a party and to carry out the transactions
               contemplated thereby, and is qualified to do business and in good
               standing in every jurisdiction where its assets are located and
               wherever necessary to carry out its business and operations, in
               each case except where failure to be so qualified or in good
               standing or a lack of such power and authority has not had and
               could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
               Effect. Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto (as so supplemented)
               correctly sets forth the ownership interest of Borrower and each
               of its Subsidiaries in each of the Subsidiaries of Borrower
               identified therein.

               consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan
               Documents do not and will not (i) violate any provision of the
               Organizational Documents of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
               (ii) violate any provision of any law or any governmental rule or
               regulation applicable to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or
               any order, judgment or decree of any court or other Government
               Authority binding on Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
               case the violation of which could reasonably be expected to have
               a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) conflict with, result in a
               breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or
               both) a default under any Contractual Obligation of Borrower or
               any of its Subsidiaries, in each case the violation of which
               could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
               (iv) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien
               upon any of the properties or assets of Borrower or any of its
               Subsidiaries (other than any Liens created under any of the Loan
               Documents in favor of Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders),
               (v) require any approval of stockholders or any approval or
               consent of any Person under any Contractual Obligation of
               Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such approvals or
               consents which will be obtained on or before the Closing Date and
               disclosed in writing to Lenders, (vi) other than as specifically
               mentioned in clauses (i) through (v) above, conflict with, result
               in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or
               both) a default under any other contractual obligation of
               Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, which conflicts, breaches or
               defaults, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
               expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (vii) otherwise
               impose any liability upon Administrative Agent or any Lenders.

          2.   Governmental Consents. The execution, delivery and performance by
               Loan Parties of the Loan Documents to which they are parties and
               the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan
               Documents do not and will not require registration with, consent
               or approval of, or notice to, or other action to, with or by, any
               Government Authority the failure of which to obtain could
               reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          3.   Binding Obligation. Each of the Loan Documents has been duly
               executed and delivered by each Loan Party that is a party thereto
               and is the legally valid and binding obligation of such Loan
               Party, enforceable

                                       85

<PAGE>

               against such Loan Party in accordance with its respective terms,
               except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
               reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or
               limiting creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles
               relating to enforceability.

          4.   Compliance with Laws. Borrower and its Subsidiaries are in
               compliance with all presently existing applicable statutes, laws,
               regulations, rules, ordinances and orders of any kind whatsoever
               (including, without limitation, any zoning and building laws or
               ordinances, subdivision laws or ordinances, any Environmental
               Laws or any presently existing rules, regulations or orders of
               any Government Authority), and with all present existing
               covenants and restrictions of record relating to the use and
               occupancy of any of their respective properties, except where the
               failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to result
               in a Material Adverse Effect.

     C.   Financial Condition.
          -------------------

          Borrower has heretofore delivered to Lenders, at Lenders' request, the
financial statements and information required to be delivered pursuant to
Subsection IV.A.6. All such statements other than pro forma financial statements
were prepared in conformity with GAAP and fairly present, the financial position
(on a consolidated basis) of the entities described in such financial statements
as at the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows
(on a consolidated basis) of the entities described therein for each of the
periods then ended, subject, in the case of any such unaudited financial
statements, to changes resulting from audit and normal year-end adjustments. No
Loan Party has (and will not have following the funding of the initial Loans)
any Contingent Obligation, contingent liability or liability for taxes,
long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment that, as of the
Closing Date, is not reflected in the foregoing financial statements or the
notes thereto and, as of any Funding Date subsequent to the Closing Date, is not
reflected in the most recent financial statements delivered to Lenders pursuant
to Subsection VI.A or the notes thereto and that, in any such case, is material
in relation to the business, operations, properties, assets, financial condition
or prospects of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

     D.   No Material Adverse Change; No Restricted Junior Payments.
          ---------------------------------------------------------

          Since September 28, 2002, no event or change has occurred that has
resulted in or evidences, either in any case or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. Since September 28, 2002, neither Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has directly or indirectly declared, ordered, paid or made, or set
apart any sum or property for, any Restricted Junior Payment or agreed to do so
except as permitted by Subsection VII.E.

     E.   Title to Properties; Liens; Real Property; Intellectual Property.
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

          L.  Title to Properties; Liens. Borrower and its Subsidiaries have (i)
good, sufficient and legal title to (in the case of fee interests in real
property), (ii) valid leasehold

                                       86

<PAGE>

interests in (in the case of leasehold interests in real or personal property),
or (iii) good title to (in the case of all other personal property), all of
their respective properties and assets reflected in the financial statements
referred to in Subsection V.C or in the most recent financial statements
delivered pursuant to Subsection VI.A, in each case except for assets disposed
of since the date of such financial statements in the ordinary course of
business or as otherwise permitted under Subsection VII.G. Except as permitted
by this Agreement, all such properties and assets are free and clear of Liens.

          1.   Real Property. As of the Closing Date, Schedule 5.5B annexed
               hereto contains a true, accurate and complete list of (i) all fee
               interests in any Real Property Assets and (ii) all leases,
               subleases or assignments of leases (together with all amendments,
               modifications, supplements, renewals or extensions of any
               thereof) affecting each Real Property Asset, regardless of
               whether a Loan Party is the landlord or tenant (whether directly
               or as an assignee or successor in interest) under such lease,
               sublease or assignment. Each agreement listed in Schedule 5.5B
               pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is
               in full force and effect, there is no default by any Loan Party
               thereunder, and Borrower does not have knowledge of any default
               that has occurred and is continuing thereunder, and each such
               agreement constitutes the legally valid and binding obligation of
               each applicable Loan Party, enforceable against such Loan Party
               in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be
               limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
               similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally
               or by equitable principles relating to enforceability. If
               Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries acquires any additional Real
               Property Assets after the Closing Date, Borrower shall deliver an
               updated Schedule 5.5B.

          2.   Intellectual Property. As of the Closing Date, Borrower and its
               Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all Intellectual
               Property necessary to the conduct of their business, except where
               the failure to own or have such right to use, individually or in
               the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to result in a
               Material Adverse Effect. No claim has been asserted and is
               pending and served by any Person challenging or questioning the
               use of any such Intellectual Property or the validity or
               effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property, nor does
               Borrower know of any valid basis for any such claim except for
               such claims that individually or in the aggregate could not
               reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
               The use of such Intellectual Property by Borrower and its
               Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any Person,
               except for such claims and infringements that, individually or in
               the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
               Material Adverse Effect. All federal and state and all foreign
               registrations of and applications for Intellectual Property, and
               all unregistered Intellectual

               Property, that are owned or licensed by Borrower or any of its
               Subsidiaries on the Closing Date are described on Schedule 5.5C
               annexed hereto.

(including any Environmental Claims) that are pending or, to the knowledge of
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting Borrower or

               Subsidiaries has received written notice from any Government
               Authority threatening any such Proceeding. After the Closing

               Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
               from any Government Authority threatening any such proceeding. No

               any Government Authority that will be binding on the Real
               Property Assets after the Closing Date and that would (i)

               applicable to such property, (ii) require the owner of such
               property to make improvements to such property or make

have been timely filed, and all taxes shown on such tax returns to be due and
payable and all assessments, fees and other

                                       88

respective properties, assets, income, businesses and franchises that are due
and payable have been paid when due and payable, except for such taxes (i) which
are not yet delinquent or (ii) that are being contested in good faith and by
proper proceedings, and against which adequate reserves or other appropriate

performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in any of its Contractual Obligations, and no condition
exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default, except where the consequences, direct or indirect, of
such default or defaults, if any, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          1.   Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is
               otherwise subject to any agreements or instruments or any charter
               or other internal restrictions or any provision of any applicable
               law, rule or regulation which, individually or in the aggregate,
               could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
               Effect.

          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
          Act.

               Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the
               Interstate Commerce Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or
               under any other federal or state statute or regulation that may
               limit its ability to incur Indebtedness or that may otherwise
               render all or any portion of the Obligations unenforceable.

          2.   OFAC. Neither the extensions of credit to Borrower hereunder nor
               the use of the respective proceeds thereof, shall cause
               Administrative Agent or any Lender to violate the U.S. Bank
               Secrecy Act, as amended, and any applicable regulations
               thereunder or any of the sanctions programs administered by the

               office, bureau or agency and any enabling legislation or
               executive order relating thereto. Without limiting the foregoing,
               neither Borrower nor any of its Affiliates (a) is or will become

               Support Terrorism (66 Fed. Reg. 49079 (2001)) (the "Executive
               Order"), (b) engages or will engage in any dealings or
               transactions prohibited by Section 2 of the Executive Order, or
               be otherwise associated with any such person in any manner
               violative of Section 2, or (c) is or will otherwise become a
               person on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked
               Persons ("SDN List") or subject to the limitations or

               ("Prohibited Persons").

          3.   Patriot Act; Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Borrower and each of
               its Subsidiaries are in compliance, in all material respects,
               with the Uniting And Strengthening of America By Providing the
               Appropriate Tools Required To Intercept And Obstruct Terrorism
               Act of 2001 (the "USA Patriot Act of 2001"). No part of the
               extensions of credit hereunder will be used, directly or
               indirectly, for any payments to any governmental official or
               employee, political party, official of a political party,
               candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an
               official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business
               or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of the United
               States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.

               consolidated basis) subject to the provisions of Subsection
               VII.B and VII.G or subject to any restriction contained in any

               scope of Subsection VII.B,will be Margin Stock.

ERISA Affiliates are in substantial compliance with all applicable provisions
and requirements of ERISA and the regulations and published interpretations
thereunder with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, and have performed all
their obligations under each Employee Benefit Plan. Each Employee Benefit Plan

               retired or former employee of Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries
               or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates.

          3.   As of the most recent valuation date for any Pension Plan, the
               amount of unfunded benefit liabilities (as defined in Section
               4001(a)(18) of ERISA), individually or in the aggregate for all
               Pension Plans (excluding for purposes of such computation any
               Pension Plans with respect to which assets exceed benefit
               liabilities), does not exceed $1,000,000.

          4.   No Borrower, Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA

               Borrower, its Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates

     P.   Matters Relating to Collateral.
          ------------------------------

          P. Creation, Perfection and Priority of Liens. The execution and
delivery of the Collateral Documents by Loan Parties, together with (i) the
actions taken on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to Subsections IV.A.12,
IV.A.13, VI.H and VI.I and the filing of any UCC financing statements and/or
amendments and PTO filings and/or amendments delivered to Administrative Agent
for filing and (ii) the delivery to Administrative Agent of any Pledged
Collateral not delivered to Administrative Agent at the time of execution and
delivery of the applicable Collateral Document (all of which Pledged Collateral
has been so delivered) are effective to create in favor of Administrative Agent
for the benefit of Lenders, as security for the respective Secured Obligations
(as defined in the applicable Collateral Document in respect of any Collateral),
a valid First Priority Lien on all of the Collateral, and all filings and other
actions reasonably necessary or reasonably desirable to perfect and maintain the
First Priority status of such Liens have been duly made or taken and remain in
full force and effect, other than the filing of any UCC financing statements
delivered to Administrative Agent for filing (but not yet filed) and the
periodic filing of UCC continuation statements in respect of UCC financing
statements filed by or on behalf of Administrative Agent.

          1.   Governmental Authorizations. No Governmental Authorization or
               other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Government
               Authority is required for either (i) the pledge or grant by any
               Loan Party of the Liens purported to be created in favor of
               Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders pursuant to any
               of the Collateral Documents or (ii) the exercise by
               Administrative Agent of any rights or remedies in respect of any
               Collateral (whether specifically granted or created pursuant to
               any of the Collateral Documents or created or provided for by
               applicable law), except for filings or recordings contemplated by
               Subsection 1.1P and except as may be required, in connection with
               the disposition of any

                                       93

<PAGE>

               Pledged Collateral, by laws generally affecting the offering and
               sale of securities.

          2.   Absence of Third-Party Filings. Except such as may have been
               filed in favor of Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders
               as contemplated by Subsection 1.1P and for Permitted Encumbrances
               and to evidence permitted lease obligations and other Liens
               permitted pursuant to Subsection VII.B, (i) no effective UCC
               financing statement, fixture filing or other instrument similar
               in effect covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file
               in any filing or recording office and (ii) no effective filing
               covering all or any part of the IP Collateral is on file in the
               PTO.

          3.   Margin Regulations. The pledge of the Pledged Collateral pursuant
               to the Collateral Documents does not violate Regulation T, U or X
               of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

          4.   Information Regarding Collateral. All information supplied to
               Administrative Agent by or on behalf of any Loan Party with
               respect to any of the Collateral (in each case taken as a whole
               with respect to any particular Collateral) is accurate and
               complete in all material respects. Neither Borrower nor any of
               its Subsidiaries nor any other Loan Party has within the six year
               period immediately preceding the date of this Agreement changed
               its name, been the surviving entity of a merger or consolidation,
               or acquired all or substantially all of the assets of any Person.

     Q.   Disclosure.
          ----------

          No representation or warranty of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
contained in the Confidential Information Memorandum or in any Loan Document or
in any other document, certificate or written statement furnished to Lenders by
or on behalf of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for use in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement contains any untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state a material fact (known to Borrower, in the
case of any document not furnished by it) necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein or therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances in which the same were made. Any projections and pro forma
financial information contained in such materials are based upon good faith
estimates and assumptions believed by Borrower to be reasonable at the time
made, it being recognized by Lenders that such projections as to future events
are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during the period or
periods covered by any such projections may differ from the projected results.
There are no facts known (or which should upon the reasonable exercise of
diligence be known) to Borrower (other than matters of a general economic
nature) that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect and that have not been disclosed herein or
in such other documents, certificates and statements furnished to Lenders for
use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence in the jurisdiction of
organization specified on Schedule 4.1D and all rights and franchises material
to its business; provided, however that neither Borrower nor any of the
Subsidiary Guarantors shall be required to preserve any such right or franchise
if the Governing Body of Borrower or such other Loan Party shall determine that
the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business

franchises before any penalty accrues thereon, and all claims (including claims
for labor, services, materials and supplies) for sums that have become due and
payable and that by law have or may become a Lien upon any of its properties or
assets, prior to the time when any penalty or fine shall be incurred with
respect thereto; provided that no such Tax, charge or claim need be paid if it
is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted
and diligently conducted, so long as (i) such reserve or other appropriate
provision, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been
made therefor and (ii) in the case of a Tax, charge or claim which has or may
become a Lien

                                       102

               file or consent to the filing of any consolidated income tax

               Subsidiaries).

     D.   Maintenance of Properties; Insurance; Application of Net Insurance/
          -------------------------------------------------------------------

          ---------------------

          R. Maintenance of Properties. (i) Borrower will, and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, maintain or cause to be maintained in good repair,
working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, all material
properties used or useful in the business of Borrower and its Subsidiaries
(including all Intellectual Property) and from time to time will make or cause
to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements thereof.

     Agreement, (ii) all registrations of any existing or future unregistered or
     copyrightable works and (iii) all Trademark opposition and cancellation
     proceedings and renewal Trademark Registrations and Copyright Registrations
     and (b) do any and all acts which are reasonably necessary or reasonably
     desirable to preserve and maintain all rights in all Intellectual Property,
     except in each case under clause (a) or clause (b) where the failure to do
     so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Any
     expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be borne solely by Borrower
     and its Subsidiaries.

          2.   Insurance. Borrower will maintain or cause to be maintained, with
               financially sound and reputable insurers, such public liability
               insurance, third party property damage insurance, business
               interruption insurance and casualty insurance with respect to
               liabilities, losses or damage in respect of the assets,
               properties and businesses of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as may
               customarily be carried or maintained under similar circumstances
               by corporations of established reputation engaged in similar
               businesses, in each case in such amounts (giving effect to
               self-insurance), with such deductibles, covering such risks and
               otherwise on such terms and conditions as shall be customary for
               corporations similarly situated in the industry. Without limiting
               the generality of the foregoing, Borrower will maintain or cause
               to be maintained (i) flood insurance with respect to each Flood
               Hazard Property that is located in a community that participates
               in the National Flood Insurance Program, in each case in
               compliance with any applicable regulations of the Board of
               Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and (ii) replacement
               value casualty insurance on the Collateral under such policies of
               insurance, with such insurance companies, in such amounts, with
               such deductibles, and covering such risks as are at all times

                    Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, then Administrative Agent
                    shall notify Borrower and Borrower shall apply such Net
                    Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to prepay the Loans (and/or

                    them directly) to prepay the Loans and/or reduce the

                    provided in Subsection II.D.2, and (b) to the extent the
                    foregoing clause (a) does not apply, Administrative Agent
                    shall deliver such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to
                    Borrower, and, if such proceeds are business interruption

                    purposes, or, if such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds
                    are other than from business interruption insurance,
                    Borrower shall, or shall cause one or more of its

                    restoring, or replacing the assets in respect of which such
                    Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds were received; provided,
                    however that if at any time Administrative Agent reasonably
                    determines (A) that Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
                    proceeding diligently with such repair, restoration or
                    replacement or (B) that

                    Borrower shall, in compliance with all applicable
                    Environmental Laws, promptly undertake, and shall cause each
                    of its Subsidiaries promptly to undertake, any and all
                    investigations, studies, sampling, testing, abatement,

                    necessary to remove, remediate, clean up or abate any
                    Hazardous Materials Activity on, under or about any Facility
                    that is in violation of any Environmental Laws or that
                    presents a material risk of giving rise to an Environmental
                    Claim. If Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries undertakes any
                    such action with respect to any Hazardous Materials,
                    Borrower or such Subsidiary shall conduct and complete such
                    action in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws
                    and in accordance with the policies, orders and directives
                    of all Government Authorities except when, and only to the
                    extent that, Borrower's or such Subsidiary's liability with
                    respect to such Hazardous Materials Activity is being
                    diligently contested in good faith and by appropriate
                    proceedings by Borrower or such Subsidiary.

          (ii)  Actions with Respect to Environmental Claims and Violations of
     Environmental Laws. Borrower shall promptly take, and shall cause each of
     its Subsidiaries promptly to take, any and all actions necessary to (i)
     cure any violation of applicable Environmental Laws by Borrower or its
     Subsidiaries and (ii) make an appropriate response to any Environmental
     Claim against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and discharge any
     obligations it may have to any Person thereunder.

     Borrower will promptly use commercially reasonable best efforts to

     of its Subsidiaries' operations that demonstrates a commitment to
     environmental compliance.

          3.   Environmental Investigations. Borrower agrees that Administrative
               Agent may, from time to time and in its reasonable discretion,
               (i) if Administrative Agent believes there has been or is likely
               to be a material diminution in the value of the property or
               material liability to the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, retain,
               at Borrower's expense, an independent professional consultant (a
               "Consultant") to review any environmental audits, investigations,
               analyses and reports relating to Hazardous Materials prepared by
               or for Borrower and (ii) if (a) Administrative Agent reasonably
               believes that Borrower has breached in any material respect any
               representation, warranty or covenant contained in Subsection V.F,
               5.13, 6.6 or VI.G or that there has been a material violation of
               Environmental Laws at any Facility or by Borrower or any of

                                       108

               its Subsidiaries at any other location or (b) an Event of Default
               has occurred and is continuing, conduct its own investigation of
               any Facility; provided that, in the case of any Facility no
               longer owned, leased, operated or used by Borrower or any of its
               Subsidiaries, Borrower shall only be obligated to use its best
               efforts to obtain permission for Administrative Agent's
               Consultant to conduct an investigation of such Facility. For
               purposes of conducting such a review and/or investigation,
               Borrower hereby grants to Administrative Agent and its agents,
               employees, consultants and contractors the right to enter into or
               onto any Facilities currently owned, leased, operated or used by
               Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and to perform such tests on
               such property (including taking samples of soil, groundwater and
               suspected asbestos-containing materials) as are reasonably
               necessary in connection therewith. Any such investigation of any
               Facility shall be conducted, unless otherwise agreed to by
               Borrower and Administrative Agent, during normal business hours
               and, to the extent reasonably practicable, shall be conducted so
               as not to interfere with the ongoing operations at such Facility
               or to cause any damage or loss to any property at such Facility.
               Borrower and Administrative Agent hereby acknowledge and agree
               that any report of any investigation conducted at the request of
               Administrative Agent pursuant to this Subsection VI.G.3 will be
               obtained and shall be used by Administrative Agent and Lenders
               for the purposes of Lenders' internal credit decisions, to
               monitor and police the Loans and to protect Lenders' security
               interests, if any, created by the Loan Documents. Administrative
               Agent agrees to deliver a copy of any such report to Borrower
               with the understanding that Borrower acknowledges and agrees that
               (x) it will indemnify and hold harmless Administrative Agent and
               each Lender from any costs, losses or liabilities relating to
               Borrower's use of or reliance on such report, (y) neither
               Administrative Agent nor any Lender makes any representation or
               warranty with respect to such report, and (z) by delivering such
               report to Borrower, neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender
               is requiring or recommending the implementation of any
               suggestions or recommendations contained in such report.

               perfected First Priority Lien on all of the personal and mixed

Subsidiaries have attempted in good faith, but are unable, to obtain such
lessor's or senior lienholder's consent after use of their best efforts (any
such non-excluded Real Property Asset described in the foregoing clause (i) or

               for the purpose of preparing an appraisal of such Additional
               Mortgaged Property satisfying the requirements of any applicable
               laws and regulations (in each case to the extent required under
               such laws and regulations as determined by Administrative Agent
               in its discretion).

          2.   Landlord Consents and Estoppels. Borrower shall, and shall cause
               each of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable best

               each Leasehold Property (i) if such Leasehold Property is held by
               Borrower or such Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, within sixty
               (60) days of the Closing Date, and (ii) if such Leasehold
               Property is acquired after the Closing Date, as soon as
               practicable after such acquisition.

               its Subsidiaries to, deliver reports and other information, in
               form, scope and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent,
               regarding environmental matters relating to Borrower and its
               Subsidiaries and the Facilities, which reports shall include a

               rise to an actual or potential violation of any Environmental Law
               or as presenting a material risk of giving rise to a material
               Environmental Claim.

satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Information regarding these Deposit
Accounts, including (a) the name and address of the financial institutions
maintaining the Deposit Accounts, and (b) the Deposit Account numbers, are set
forth on Schedule 6.10 annexed hereto. Borrower shall not permit any of such

Administrative Agent a Deposit Account Control Agreement, and (ii) taken all
other steps necessary or, in the opinion of Administrative Agent, desirable to
ensure that Administrative Agent will have a First Priority Lien in such Deposit

Borrower or such Subsidiary is unable to obtain such agreement from such
financial institution Borrower shall, or shall cause such Subsidiary to, within
30 days after receiving a written request by Administrative Agent to do so,
transfer all amounts in the applicable Deposit Account to a Deposit Account

obtained such an agreement. Borrower shall not permit the aggregate amount on
deposit in all Deposit Accounts of Borrower and of its Subsidiaries (other than

          U.  Prohibition on Liens. Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or permit
to exist any Lien on or with respect to any property or asset of any kind
(including any document or instrument in respect of goods or accounts
receivable) of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired, or any income or profits therefrom or proceeds thereof, or
file or permit the filing of, or permit to remain in effect, any financing

               b.   Liens granted pursuant to the Collateral Documents;

               c.   Liens existing on the Closing Date and set forth on Schedule

                    or assets subject thereto on the Closing Date;

               d.   Other Liens securing Indebtedness in an aggregate amount not

               e.   Liens incurred in connection with the extension, renewal or
                    refinancing of the Indebtedness secured by the Liens
                    described in clause (iii) above, provided that any
                    extension, renewal or replacement Lien (A) is limited to the
                    property covered by the terms of the existing Lien and (B)
                    secures Indebtedness which is no greater in amount and has
                    material terms no less favorable to Borrower or the
                    applicable Subsidiary and Lenders than the Indebtedness
                    secured by the existing Lien.

          2.   Equitable Lien in Favor of Lenders. If Borrower or any of its
               Subsidiaries shall create or assume any Lien upon any of its
               properties or

                                       114

<PAGE>

               assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than Liens
               excepted by the provisions of Subsection 1.1U, it shall make or
               cause to be made effective provision whereby the Obligations will
               be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with any and all
               other Indebtedness secured thereby as long as any such
               Indebtedness shall be so secured which provision shall not cure
               any default that may have occurred and which provision shall be
               made without prejudice to any rights of Administrative Agent or
               Lenders with respect to such default; provided that,
               notwithstanding the foregoing, this covenant shall not be
               construed as a consent by Requisite Lenders to the creation or
               assumption of any such Lien not permitted by the provisions of
               Subsection 1.1U.

          3.   No Further Negative Pledges. Neither Borrower nor any of its
               Subsidiaries shall enter into any agreement prohibiting the
               creation or assumption of any Lien upon any of its properties or
               assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, except with
               respect to specific property encumbered to secure payment of
               particular Indebtedness or to be sold pursuant to an executed
               agreement with respect to an Asset Sale or with respect to an
               acquisition or Investment permitted by this Agreement.

          4.   No Restrictions on Subsidiary Distributions to Borrower or Other
               Subsidiaries. Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its
               Subsidiaries to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or
               become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any
               kind on the ability of any such Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends
               or make any other distributions on any of such Subsidiary's
               Capital Stock owned by Borrower or any other Subsidiary of
               Borrower, (ii) repay or prepay any Indebtedness owed by such
               Subsidiary to Borrower or any other Subsidiary of Borrower, (iii)

               Borrower, or (iv) transfer any of its property or assets to
               Borrower or any other Subsidiary of Borrower, except as provided
               in this Agreement.

                    and continue to own such assets after the acquisition
                    thereof; provided that (i) no Potential Event of Default or

pursuant to clause (ii) of such paragraph Borrower shall pay all arrears of
interest and all payments on account of principal which shall have become due
otherwise than as a result of such acceleration (with interest on principal and,
to the extent permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the rates specified in
this Agreement) and all Events of Default and Potential Events of Default (other
than non-payment of the principal of and accrued interest on the Loans, in each
case which is due and payable solely by virtue of acceleration) shall be
remedied or waived pursuant to Subsection X.F, then Requisite Lenders, by
written notice to Borrower, may at their option rescind and annul such
acceleration and its consequences; but such action shall not affect any
subsequent Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or impair any right
consequent thereon and, if the Commitments of Lenders to make Loans and issue or
participate in Letters of Credit have been terminated pursuant to clause (ii),
such Commitments shall be reinstated only with the approval of each Lender
directly affected. The provisions of this paragraph are intended merely to bind
Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election of Requisite Lenders and
are not intended, directly or indirectly, to benefit Borrower, and such
provisions shall not at any time be construed so as to grant Borrower the right
to require Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder or to preclude
Administrative Agent or Lenders from exercising any of the rights or remedies
available to them under any of the Loan Documents, even if the conditions set
forth in this paragraph are met.

IX.  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     A.   Appointment.
          -----------

          1.   Appointment of Administrative Agent. CIBC is hereby appointed
               Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
               and each Lender hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to act as
               its administrative agent in accordance with the terms of this
               Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Administrative Agent
               agrees to act upon the express conditions contained in this
               Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as applicable. The
               provisions of this IX are solely for the benefit of
               Administrative Agent and Lenders and no Loan Party shall have any
               rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions
               thereof. In performing its functions and duties under this
               Agreement, Administrative Agent shall act solely as an
               administrative agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not
               be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship
               of agency or trust with or for Borrower or any of its
               Subsidiaries.

          2.   Appointment of Supplemental Collateral Agents. It is the purpose
               of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall
               be no violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or
               restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to
               transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is
               recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any
               of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in

                                       127

<PAGE>

               case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case
               Administrative Agent deems that by reason of any present or
               future law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the
               rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other
               Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or
               necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that
               Administrative Agent appoint an additional individual or
               institution as a separate trustee, co-trustee, collateral agent
               or collateral co-agent (any such additional individual or
               institution being referred to herein individually as a
               "Supplemental Collateral Agent" and collectively as "Supplemental
               Collateral Agents").

          If Administrative Agent appoints a Supplemental Collateral Agent with
respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty
expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be
exercised by or vested in or conveyed to Administrative Agent with respect to
such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Collateral
Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such
Supplemental Collateral Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges
with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such
Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents
and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental
Collateral Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either Administrative Agent
or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this IX and of
Subsections X.B and X.C that refer to Administrative Agent shall inure to the
benefit of such Supplemental Collateral Agent and all references therein to
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to Administrative Agent
and/or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the context may require.

          Should any instrument in writing from Borrower or any other Loan Party
be required by any Supplemental Collateral Agent so appointed by Administrative
Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such
rights, powers, privileges and duties, Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan
Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly
upon request by Administrative Agent. In case any Supplemental Collateral Agent,
or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be
removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental
Collateral Agent, to the extent permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised
by Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral
Agent.

     B.   Powers and Duties; General Immunity.
          -----------------------------------

          1.   Powers; Duties Specified. Each Lender irrevocably authorizes
               Administrative Agent to take such action on such Lender's behalf
               and to exercise such powers, rights and remedies hereunder and
               under the other Loan Documents as are specifically delegated or
               granted to Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,
               together with such powers, rights and remedies as are reasonably
               incidental thereto. Administrative Agent shall have only those
               duties and responsibilities that are expressly specified in this
               Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                                       128

<PAGE>

               Administrative Agent may exercise such powers, rights and
               remedies and perform such duties by or through its agents or
               employees. Administrative Agent shall not have, by reason of this
               Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, a fiduciary
               relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in this
               Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, expressed or
               implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose
               upon Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this
               Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents except as expressly
               set forth herein or therein.

          2.   No Responsibility for Certain Matters. Administrative Agent shall
               not be responsible to any Lender for the execution,
               effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
               collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan
               Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or
               statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral
               statements or in any financial or other statements, instruments,
               reports or certificates or any other documents furnished or made
               by Administrative Agent to Lenders or by or on behalf of Borrower
               to Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the Loan
               Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby or for the
               financial condition or business affairs of Borrower or any other
               Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall
               Administrative Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as to
               the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions,
               provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of the Loan
               Documents or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the
               use of the Letters of Credit or as to the existence or possible
               existence of any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default.
               Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
               notwithstanding, Administrative Agent shall not have any
               liability arising from confirmations of the amount of outstanding
               Loans or the Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts
               thereof unless any such liability results from the gross
               negligence or willful misconduct of Administrative Agent.

          3.   Exculpatory Provisions. Neither Administrative Agent nor any of
               its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to
               Lenders for any action taken or omitted by Administrative Agent
               under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents except to
               the extent caused by Administrative Agent's gross negligence or
               willful misconduct. Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
               refrain from any act or the taking of any action (including the
               failure to take an action) in connection with this Agreement or
               any of the other Loan Documents or from the exercise of any
               power, discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or
               thereunder unless and until Administrative Agent shall have
               received instructions in respect thereof from Requisite Lenders
               (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such
               instructions under Subsection X.F) and, upon receipt

                                       129

<PAGE>

               of such instructions from Requisite Lenders (or such other
               Lenders, as the case may be), Administrative Agent shall be
               entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or
               to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance
               with such instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of
               the foregoing, (i) Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
               rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
               communication, instrument or document believed by it to be
               genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper
               Person or Persons, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be
               protected in relying on opinions and judgments of attorneys (who
               may be attorneys for Borrower and its Subsidiaries), accountants,
               experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii)
               no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against
               Administrative Agent as a result of Administrative Agent acting
               or (where so instructed) refraining from acting under this
               Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with
               the instructions of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as
               may be required to give such instructions under Subsection X.F).

          4.   Administrative Agent Entitled to Act as Lender. The agency hereby
               created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and
               powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon,
               Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender
               hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Loans and the
               Letters of Credit, Administrative Agent shall have the same
               rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise
               the same as though it were not performing the duties and
               functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or
               "Lenders" or any similar term shall, unless the context clearly
               otherwise indicates, include Administrative Agent in its
               individual capacity. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may
               accept deposits from, lend money to, acquire equity interests in
               and generally engage in any kind of commercial banking,
               investment banking, trust, financial advisory or other business
               with Borrower or any of its Affiliates as if it were not
               performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and
               other consideration from Borrower for services in connection with
               this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the
               same to Lenders.

     C.   Representations and Warranties; No Responsibility for Appraisal of
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
          Creditworthiness.
          ----------------

          Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Borrower and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the making of the Loans and the extensions
of credit hereunder and that it has made and shall continue to make its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of Borrower and its Subsidiaries.
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either initially
or on a continuing basis, to make any such investigation or any such appraisal
on behalf of Lenders or, except as expressly provided herein, to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information with

                                       130

<PAGE>

respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the
Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and Administrative Agent shall not
have any responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of
any information provided to Lenders.

     D.   Right to Indemnity.
          ------------------

          Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally agrees to
indemnify Administrative Agent, Co-Lead Arrangers and their officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys, professional advisors and affiliates, to the
extent that any such Person shall not have been reimbursed by Borrower, for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and
disbursements and fees and disbursements of any financial advisor engaged by
Administrative Agent) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Administrative Agent or such
other Persons in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing its
duties as an Administrative Agent or Co-Lead Arranger hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity as Administrative Agent or
Co-Lead Arranger in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Administrative Agent's or
any Co-Lead Arranger's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a
final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any
indemnity furnished to Administrative Agent or any other such Person for any
purpose shall, in the opinion of Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become
impaired, Administrative Agent and/or Co-Lead Arrangers may call for additional
indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until
such additional indemnity is furnished.

     E.   Successor Administrative Agent.
          ------------------------------

          Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving thirty (30)
days' prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Borrower. Upon any such notice
of resignation, Requisite Lenders shall have the right, upon twenty (20)
Business Days' notice to Borrower, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent
subject to Borrower's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and
the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this IX shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

     F.   Collateral Documents and Guaranties.
          -----------------------------------

          Each Lender hereby further authorizes Administrative Agent, on behalf
of and for the benefit of Lenders, to enter into each Collateral Document as
secured party and to be

                                       131

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent for and representative of Lenders under the Subsidiary
Guaranty, and each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of each Collateral
Document and the Subsidiary Guaranty; provided that Administrative Agent shall
not (i) enter into or consent to any material amendment, modification,
termination or waiver of any provision contained in any Collateral Document or
the Subsidiary Guaranty or (ii) release any Collateral or Subsidiary Guarantor
(except as otherwise expressly permitted or required pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or the applicable Collateral Document), in each case without the
prior consent of Requisite Lenders (or, if required pursuant to Subsection X.F,
all Lenders); provided further, however, that, without further written consent
or authorization from Lenders, Administrative Agent may execute any documents or
instruments necessary to (a) release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral
that is the subject of a sale or other disposition of assets permitted by this
Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise consented, or (b) release
any Subsidiary Guarantor from the Subsidiary Guaranty if all of the Capital
Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor is sold to any Person (other than an
Affiliate of Borrower) pursuant to a sale or other disposition permitted
hereunder or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise consented or (c)
subordinate the Liens of Administrative Agent, on behalf of Lenders, to any
Liens permitted by Subsection VII.B provided that, in the case of a sale of such
item of Collateral referred to in subclause (a) or (b), the requirements of
Subsection X.F are satisfied. Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to
the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower, Administrative Agent and each Lender
hereby agree that (X) no Lender shall have any right individually to realize
upon any of the Collateral under any Collateral Document or to enforce the
Subsidiary Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and
remedies under the Collateral Documents and the Subsidiary Guaranty may be
exercised solely by Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders in
accordance with the terms thereof, and (Y) in the event of a foreclosure by
Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private
sale, Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of
such Collateral at any such sale and Administrative Agent, as administrative
agent for and representative of Lenders (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or
their respective individual capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise
agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making
settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the
Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations
as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by
Administrative Agent at such sale.

     G.   Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.
          ---------------------------------------------

          In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall
then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on
Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise

               a.   to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal
                    and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and
                    any other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file
                    such other papers or documents as may be reasonably
                    necessary or reasonably

                                       132

<PAGE>

                    advisable in order to have the claims of Lenders,
                    Administrative Agent and Co-Lead Arrangers (including any
                    claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
                    disbursements and advances of Lenders, Administrative Agent
                    and Co-Lead Arrangers and their agents and counsel and all
                    other amounts due Lenders, Administrative Agent and Co-Lead
                    Arrangers under Subsections II.C and X.B) allowed in such
                    judicial proceeding, and

               b.   to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable
                    or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the
                    same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to Administrative Agent and, if Administrative
Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to Lenders, to pay
to Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of Administrative Agent and Co-Lead
Arrangers and their agents and counsel, and any other amounts due Administrative
Agent and Co-Lead Arrangers under Subsections II.C and X.B.

          Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize Administrative
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lenders or to authorize Administrative Agent to
vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

     A.   Assignments and Participations in Loans and Letters of Credit.
          -------------------------------------------------------------

          1.   General. Subject to Subsections X.A.2 and X.A.3, each Lender
               shall have the right at any time to (i) sell, assign or transfer
               to any Eligible Assignee, or (ii) sell participations to any
               Person in, all or any part of its Commitments or any Loan or
               Loans made by it or its Letters of Credit (or participations in
               Letters of Credit) or any other interest herein or in any other
               Obligations owed to it; provided that no such sale, assignment,
               transfer or participation shall, without the consent of Borrower,
               require Borrower to file a registration statement with the
               Securities and Exchange Commission or apply to qualify such sale,
               assignment, transfer or participation under the securities laws
               of any state; provided, further, that no such sale, assignment,
               or transfer described in clause (i) above shall be effective
               unless and until an Assignment Agreement effecting such sale,
               assignment or transfer shall have been accepted by Administrative
               Agent and recorded in the Register as provided in Subsection
               X.A.2.b; and provided, further, that no such sale, assignment, or
               transfer of any Letter of Credit or any participation therein may
               be made separately from a sale, assignment, transfer or
               participation of a corresponding interest in the

                                       133

               Revolving Loan Commitment and the Revolving Loans of the Lender
               effecting such sale, assignment, transfer or participation.
               Except as otherwise provided in this Subsection X.A, no Lender
               shall, as between Borrower and such Lender, be relieved of any of
               its obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment or
               transfer of, or any granting of participations in, all or any
               part of its Commitments or the Loans, or Letters of Credit or
               participations therein, or the other Obligations owed to such
               Lender, and such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
               performance of such Obligations, and Borrower shall continue to
               deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
               Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.

          2.   Assignments.

               a.   Amounts and Terms of Assignments. Each Commitment, Loan,
                    Letter of Credit or participation therein, or other
                    Obligation may (a) be assigned in any amount to another
                    Lender, or to an Affiliate or Approved Fund of the assigning
                    Lender or another Lender, with the giving of notice to
                    Borrower and Administrative Agent or (b) be assigned in an
                    aggregate amount of not less than $1,000,000 (or such lesser
                    amount as shall constitute the aggregate amount of the
                    Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit and participations
                    therein, or other Obligations of the assigning Lender) to
                    any other Eligible Assignee treating any two or more
                    Approved Funds with the same investment advisor as a single
                    Eligible Assignee with the consent of Borrower (unless a
                    Potential Event of Default or an Event of Default has
                    occurred and is continuing) and Administrative Agent (which
                    consent of Borrower and Administrative Agent shall not be
                    unreasonably withheld or delayed). To the extent of any such
                    assignment in accordance with either clause (a) or (b)
                    above, the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its
                    obligations with respect to its Commitments, Loans, Letters
                    of Credit and participations therein, or other Obligations
                    or the portion thereof so assigned. The parties to each such
                    assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative
                    Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an
                    Assignment Agreement, together with a processing and
                    recordation fee of $3,500 (provided that (i) no such
                    processing and recordation fee shall be payable if the
                    assignee is an Affiliate of the assignor or a Person under
                    common management with the assignor and (ii) only one such
                    fee shall be required in connection with a simultaneous
                    assignment to a group of Approved Funds with the same
                    investment advisor) and such forms (including an
                    administrative questionnaire if the Eligible Assignee is not
                    a Lender), certificates or other evidence, if any, with
                    respect to United States federal

<PAGE>

                    income tax withholding matters as the assignee under such
                    Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver to
                    Administrative Agent pursuant to Subsection II.GB(iii)(a).
                    Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recordation,
                    from and after the effective date specified in such
                    Assignment Agreement, (y) the assignee thereunder shall be a
                    party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations
                    hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
                    Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations
                    of a Lender hereunder, and (z) the assigning Lender
                    thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
                    hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such
                    Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any
                    rights that survive the termination of this Agreement under
                    Subsection X.I.1) and be released from its obligations under
                    this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement
                    covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning
                    Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
                    Lender shall cease to be a party hereto except for any
                    rights retained as described above; provided that, anything
                    contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary
                    notwithstanding, if such Lender is the Issuing Lender with
                    respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit such Lender
                    shall continue to have all rights and obligations of an
                    Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit until
                    the cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit and
                    the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder). The
                    Commitments hereunder shall be modified to reflect the
                    Commitment of such assignee and any remaining Commitment of
                    such assigning Lender and, if any such assignment occurs
                    after the issuance of any Notes hereunder, the assigning
                    Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or
                    as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its
                    applicable Notes, if any, to Administrative Agent for
                    cancellation, and thereupon new Notes shall, if so requested
                    by the assignee and/or the assigning Lender in accordance
                    with Subsection II.A.4, be issued to the assignee and/or to
                    the assigning Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit
                    IV or Exhibit V annexed hereto, as the case may be, with
                    appropriate insertions, to reflect the new Commitments
                    and/or outstanding Revolving Loans and/or outstanding Term
                    Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee and/or the
                    assigning Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
                    rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
                    comply with this Subsection X.A.2 shall be treated for
                    purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
                    participation in such rights and obligations in accordance
                    with Subsection X.A.3.

               b.   Acceptance by Administrative Agent; Recordation in Register.
                    Upon its receipt of an Assignment Agreement executed by an
                    assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an
                    Eligible Assignee, together with the processing and
                    recordation fee (if so required) referred to in Subsection
                    X.A.2.a and any forms, certificates or other evidence with
                    respect to United States federal income tax withholding
                    matters that such assignee may be required to deliver to
                    Administrative Agent pursuant to Subsection II.HB(iii)(a),
                    Administrative Agent shall, if Administrative Agent (and if
                    necessary, Borrower) has consented to the assignment
                    evidenced thereby (in each case to the extent such consent
                    is required pursuant to Subsection X.A.2.a), (a) accept such
                    Assignment Agreement by executing a counterpart thereof as
                    provided therein (which acceptance shall evidence any
                    required consent of Administrative Agent to such
                    assignment), (b) record the information contained therein in
                    the Register, and (c) give prompt notice thereof to
                    Borrower. Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each
                    Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it as
                    provided in this Subsection X.A.2.b.

               c.   If the consent of Borrower to an assignment or to an
                    Eligible Assignee is required hereunder (including a consent
                    to an assignment which does not meet the minimum assignment
                    thresholds specified in Subsection 10.1B(i)), Borrower shall
                    be deemed to have given its consent five Business Days after
                    the date notice thereof has been delivered by the assigning
                    Lender (through Administrative Agent) unless such consent is
                    expressly refused by Borrower prior to such fifth Business
                    Day.

          3.   Participations. Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice
               to, Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations to one
               or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a
               portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this
               Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or
               the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
               obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)
               such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
               hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii)
               Borrower, Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall
               continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
               connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
               Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender
               sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
               retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to
               approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
               the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument
               may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of
               such Participant, agree to any

                                       136

<PAGE>

               amendment, modification or waiver that affects such Participant
               if such amendment, modification or waiver requires the unanimous
               written consent of all Lenders pursuant to Subsection X.F.
               Subject to Subsection X.A.4, Borrower agrees that each
               Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Subsections
               2.6D, 2.7, and 3.6 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and
               had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to this
               Subsection X.A.3; provided, however, that in no event shall
               Borrower be obligated to make any payment with respect to such
               Subsections which is greater than the amount that Borrower would
               have paid to the Lender had no such participation been sold. To
               the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
               entitled to the benefits of Subsection 10.4 as though it were a
               Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
               Subsection 10.5 as though it were a Lender if any amounts
               outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall
               have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the
               occurrence of an Event of Default, each participant shall be
               deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its
               participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to
               the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest
               were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement.

          4.   No Greater Payments to Participants. A Participant shall not be
               entitled to receive any greater payment under Subsections 2.6D,
               2.7, and 3.6 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
               to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
               Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
               Participant is made with Borrower's prior written consent. A
               Participant that would be a Non-US Lender if it were a Lender
               shall not be entitled to the benefits of Subsection 2.7 unless
               Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
               Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of
               Borrower, to comply with Subsection 2.7B(iii) as though it were a
               Lender.

          5.   Assignments to Secured Parties and Trustees.

               a.   In addition to the assignments and participations permitted
                    under the foregoing provisions of this Subsection X.A, (1)
                    any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its
                    Loans, the other Obligations owed to such Lender and its
                    Notes to any creditor, including any Federal Reserve Bank,
                    as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board
                    of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any operating
                    circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that
                    (i) no Lender shall, as between Borrower and such Lender, be
                    relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of
                    any such assignment and pledge, and (ii) in no event shall
                    such creditor be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled
                    to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any
                    action hereunder and (2) any Lender which is an Approved
                    Fund may

                                       137

<PAGE>

                    pledge its Loans and/or Notes to its trustee for the benefit
                    of its investors without consent by or notice to Borrower or
                    Administrative Agent.

          6.   Information. Each Lender may furnish any information concerning
               Borrower and its Subsidiaries in the possession of that Lender
               from time to time to assignees and participants (including
               prospective assignees and participants), subject to Subsection
               X.T.

          7.   Representations of Lenders. Each Lender listed on the signature
               pages hereof hereby represents and warrants (i) that it is an
               Eligible Assignee described in clause (A) of the definition
               thereof; (ii) that it has experience and expertise in the making
               of loans such as the Loans; and (iii) that it will make its Loans
               for its own account in the ordinary course of its business and
               without a present view to distribution of such Loans within the
               meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other
               federal securities laws (it being understood that, subject to the
               provisions of this Subsection X.A, the disposition of such Loans
               or any interests therein shall at all times remain within its
               exclusive control). Each Lender that becomes a party hereto
               pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to agree that
               the representations and warranties of such Lender contained in
               such Assignment Agreement are incorporated herein by this
               reference.

     B.   Expenses.
          --------

          Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated, Borrower agrees to pay promptly (i) all the actual and reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of preparation of the Loan Documents and any
consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto; (ii) all the costs
of furnishing all opinions by counsel for Borrower (including any opinions
requested by Lenders as to any legal matters arising hereunder) and of
Borrower's performance of and compliance with all agreements and conditions on
its part to be performed or complied with under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents including with respect to confirming compliance with
environmental, insurance and solvency requirements; (iii) the reasonable fees,
expenses and disbursements of counsel to Administrative Agent in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution and administration of the Loan Documents
and any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and any
other documents or matters requested by Borrower; (iv) all the actual costs and
reasonable expenses of creating and perfecting Liens in favor of Administrative
Agent on behalf of Lenders pursuant to any Collateral Document, including filing

costs and reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of any auditors, accountants or appraisers and any environmental
or other consultants, advisors and agents employed or retained by

                                       138

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent or its counsel) of obtaining and reviewing any
environmental audits or reports provided for as a result of its due diligence
and any audits or reports provided for under Subsection VI.I.4 or 6.7 with
respect to any Collateral; (vi) the custody or preservation of any of the
Collateral; (vii) all other actual and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
Administrative Agent in connection with the syndication of the Commitments and
the negotiation, preparation and execution of the Loan Documents and any
consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and the
transactions contemplated thereby; and (viii) after the occurrence of an Event
of Default, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees
(including allocated costs of internal counsel) and fees, costs and expenses of
accountants, advisors and consultants, incurred by Administrative Agent and its
counsel relating to efforts to (a) evaluate or assess any Loan Party, its
business or financial condition and (b) protect, evaluate, assess or dispose of
any of the Collateral; and (ix) all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees (including allocated costs of internal counsel), fees, costs and
expenses of accountants, advisors and consultants and costs of settlement,
incurred by Administrative Agent and each Lender in enforcing any Obligations of
or in collecting any payments due from any Loan Party hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents by reason of such Event of Default (including in connection
with the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any of the
Collateral or the enforcement of the Subsidiary Guaranty) or in connection with
any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this
Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to any insolvency or
bankruptcy proceedings.

     C.   Indemnity.
          ---------

          In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to Subsection X.B,
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated,
Borrower agrees to defend (subject to Indemnitees' selection of counsel),
indemnify, pay and hold harmless Administrative Agent and Lenders, and the
officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents, representatives, trustees,
advisors and affiliates of Administrative Agent and Lenders (collectively called
the "Indemnitees"), from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities (as
hereinafter defined); provided that Borrower shall not have any obligation to
any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of that Indemnitee as determined by a final non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

          As used herein, "Indemnified Liabilities" means, collectively, any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages (including natural resource
damages), penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims (including Environmental
Claims and Releases), costs (including the costs of any investigation, study,
sampling, testing, abatement, cleanup, removal, remediation or other response
action necessary to remove, remediate, clean up or abate any Hazardous Materials
Activity), expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for Indemnitees in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding
commenced or threatened by any Person, whether or not any such Indemnitee shall
be designated as a party or a potential party thereto, and any fees or expenses
incurred by Indemnitees in enforcing this indemnity), whether direct, indirect
or consequential and whether based on any federal, state or foreign laws,
statutes, rules or regulations (including securities and commercial laws,
statutes, rules or regulations and

                                       139

<PAGE>

Environmental Laws), on common law or equitable cause or on contract or
otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such
Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of (i) this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including Lenders' agreement to make the Loans hereunder or the use or intended
use of the proceeds thereof or the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder or
the use or intended use of any thereof, or any enforcement of any of the Loan
Documents (including any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any
of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Subsidiary Guaranty), (ii) the
statements contained in the commitment letter delivered by any Lender to
Borrower or Administrative Agent with respect thereto, or (iii) any
Environmental Claim or any Hazardous Materials Activity relating to or arising
from, directly or indirectly, any past or present activity, operation, land
ownership, or practice of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

          To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and hold
harmless set forth in this Subsection X.C may be unenforceable in whole or in
part because they are violative of any law or public policy, Borrower shall
contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under
applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities
incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

     D.   Set-Off; Security Interest in Deposit Accounts.
          ----------------------------------------------

          In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable
law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default each Lender is hereby authorized by Borrower at any time or
from time to time, without notice to Borrower or to any other Person, any such
notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply
any and all deposits or other amounts held by any Lender (or any Affiliate of
such Lender) for the credit or account of Borrower (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final, including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates
of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust accounts) and
any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender (or any
Affiliate of such Lender) to or for the credit or the account of Borrower and
each other Loan Party against and on account of the Obligations of Borrower and
each other Loan Party to that Lender (or any Affiliate of such Lender) or to any
other Lender (or any Affiliate of any other Lender) under this Agreement, the
Letters of Credit and participations therein and the other Loan Documents,
including all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected
with this Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations therein or any
other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not (i) that Lender shall have
made any demand hereunder or (ii) the principal of or the interest on the Loans
or any amounts in respect of the Letters of Credit or any other amounts due
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall have become due and
payable pursuant to VIII and although said obligations and liabilities, or any
of them, may be contingent or unmatured. Borrower hereby further grants to
Administrative Agent and each Lender a security interest in all deposits and
accounts maintained with Administrative Agent or such Lender as security for the
Obligations.

                                       140

<PAGE>

     E.   Ratable Sharing.
          ---------------

          Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall,
whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made
and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), by realization upon
security, through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan
Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash
collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a
proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in
respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to that
Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "Aggregate
Amounts Due" to such Lender) that is greater than the proportion received by any
other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender
hereunder, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall
(i) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the receipt of such
payment and (ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations
(which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a participation
simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment)
in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of
Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the
Aggregate Amounts Due to them hereunder; provided that if all or part of such
proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or
otherwise (and whether by litigation, demand, settlement or otherwise), those
purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such
participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent
of such recovery, but without interest. Borrower expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased
may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with
respect to any and all monies owing by Borrower to that holder with respect
thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation
held by that holder.

     F.   Amendments and Waivers.
          ----------------------

          No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or of the Notes or of any of the other Loan Documents, and no
consent to any departure by Borrower herefrom or therefrom, shall in any event
be effective without the written concurrence of Requisite Lenders; unless
otherwise provided elsewhere in this Agreement; provided that in addition:

          (a)  any such amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent
     which:

               (i)    postpones the date or reduces the amount of any scheduled
          payment of principal of any of the Loans;

               (ii)   postpones the date on which any interest or any fees are
          payable or reduces the amount of any interest or any fees payable
          hereunder (other than any waiver of any increase in the interest rate
          applicable to any of the Loans pursuant to Subsection 2.2E);

                                       141

<PAGE>

               (iii)  amends, modifies, terminates or waives any provision of
          Subsection II.B which decreases the interest rate borne by Loans
          (other than any waiver of any increase in the interest rate applicable
          to such Loans pursuant to Subsection 2.2) or the percentages set forth
          in the definitions of "Applicable Base Rate Margin" and "Applicable
          LIBOR Margin";

               (iv)   changes in any manner the definition of "Pro Rata Share"
          or the definition of "Requisite Lenders"

               (v)    changes the provisions of Subsections 2.4C(iii), 2.4D or
          10.5 to provide that Lenders will not share pro rata in payments,
          proceeds of Collateral or Aggregate Amounts Due;

               (vi)   changes in any manner any provision of this Agreement
          which, by its terms, expressly requires the approval or concurrence of
          all Lenders;

               (vii)  releases any Lien granted in favor of Administrative Agent
          with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral;

               (viii) releases all or substantially all of the Subsidiary
          Guarantors from their obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty, in
          each case other than in accordance with the terms of the Loan
          Documents;

               (ix)   changes in any manner the provisions contained in
          Subsection VIII.A or this Subsection X.F; or

               (x)    increases the amount of any Lender's Term Loan Commitments
          or Revolving Loan Commitments over the amount thereof then in effect
          (it being understood that amendments, modifications or waivers of
          conditions precedent, representations and warranties, covenants or
          Events of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Commitments shall
          not constitute an increase of the Commitments, and that an increase in
          the available portion of any Commitments shall not constitute an
          increase in the Commitments);

          shall be effective only if evidenced by the written concurrence of all
Lenders affected thereby.

          In addition,

          (a)  no amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any
     provision of any Note shall be effective without the written concurrence of
     the Lender that is the holder of that Note;

          (b)  no amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any
     provision of Subsection 2.1A(i)-(ii) or of any other provision of this
     Agreement relating to the Tranche B Term Loan Commitments or the Revolving
     Loan Commitments shall increase the Commitments of any Lender over the
     amount thereof then in effect without the

                                       142

<PAGE>

     consent of Requisite Lenders and such Lender (it being understood that
     amendments, modifications or waivers of conditions precedent,
     representations and warranties, covenants or Events of Default or of a
     mandatory reduction in the Commitments shall not constitute an increase of
     the Commitment of any Lender, and that an increase in the available portion
     of any Commitment of any Lender shall not constitute an increase in the
     Commitment of such Lender); and

          (c)  no amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any
     provision of IX or of any other provision of this Agreement that, by its
     terms, expressly requires the approval or concurrence of Administrative
     Agent shall be effective without the written concurrence of Administrative
     Agent.

          Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the
concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or
consents on behalf of that Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No
notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle Borrower to any other
or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any amendment,
modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance with this
Subsection X.F shall be binding upon each Lender at the time outstanding, each
future Lender and, if signed by Borrower, on Borrower. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, as among Lenders and Administrative Agent in
connection with the exercise of remedies under any of Loan Documents, the
written concurrence of Requisite Lenders shall be required for Administrative
Agent to exercise proxy rights in the election of the Governing Body of any Loan
Party owning real property or to acquire any ownership interest in real property
of any Loan Party.

     G.   Independence of Covenants.
          -------------------------

          All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a
particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the
fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within
the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event
of Default or Potential Event of Default if such action is taken or condition
exists.

     H.   Notices; Effectiveness of Signatures.
          ------------------------------------

          Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice or other
communication herein required or permitted to be given shall be in writing and
may be personally served, telexed or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail
or courier service and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in
person or by courier service, upon receipt of telefacsimile or telex, or three
Business Days after depositing it in the United States mail with postage prepaid
and properly addressed; provided that notices delivered by United States mail to
Administrative Agent or any Loan Party shall not be effective until received.
For the purposes hereof, the address of each party hereto shall be as set forth
under such party's name on the signature pages hereof or (i) as to Borrower and
Administrative Agent, such other address as shall be designated by such Person
in a written notice delivered to the other parties hereto and (ii) as to each
other

                                       143

<PAGE>

party, such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written
notice delivered to Administrative Agent. Electronic mail may be used to
distribute routine communications, such as financial statements and other
information; provided, however, that no signature with respect to any notice,
request, agreement, waiver, amendment or other document or any notice that is
intended to have binding effect may be sent by electronic mail.

     Loan Documents and notices under the Loan Documents may be transmitted
and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of any such documents and
signatures shall, subject to applicable law, have the same force and effect as
an original copy with manual signatures and shall be binding on all Loan
Parties, Agents and Lenders. Administrative Agent may also require that any such
documents and signature be confirmed by a manually-signed copy thereof;
provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver any such
manually-signed copy shall not affect the effectiveness of any facsimile
document or signature.

     I.   Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.
          ------------------------------------------------------

          W. All representations, warranties and agreements made herein shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans
and the issuance of the Letters of Credit hereunder.

          1.   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law to
               the contrary, the agreements of Borrower set forth in Subsections
               2.6D, 2.7, 1.1F, X.B, X.C, X.D, X.R and X.S and the agreements of
               Lenders set forth in Subsections IX.B.3, IX.D, X.E and X.S shall
               survive, for the applicable limitations period, the payment of
               the Loans, the cancellation or expiration of the Letters of
               Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and
               the termination of this Agreement.

     J.   Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
          -----------------------------------------------------

          No failure or delay on the part of Administrative Agent or any Lender
in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be
a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

     K.   Marshalling; Payments Set Aside.
          -------------------------------

          Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be under any
obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Borrower or any other party or
against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that
Borrower makes a payment or payments to Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to
Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders), or Administrative Agent or
Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and
such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any
part thereof are

                                       144

<PAGE>

subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any equitable
cause (whether by litigation, demand, settlement or otherwise), then, to the
extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to
be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto,
shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or
payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

     L.   Severability.
          ------------

          In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement or the
Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or
obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

     M.   Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders' Rights.
          ----------------------------------------------------------

          The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall
be responsible for the obligations or Commitments of any other Lender hereunder.
Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and no action taken by
Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute Lenders, or
Lenders and Borrower, as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender
shall be a separate and independent debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to
protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and it shall not be
necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any
proceeding for such purpose.

     N.   Release of Security; Guarantees.
          -------------------------------

          Upon the proposed sale or other disposition of any Collateral that is
permitted by this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders (or, if required
pursuant to Subsection 10.6, all Lenders) have otherwise consented, or the sale
or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor to
any Person (other than to a Subsidiary Guarantor) permitted by this Agreement or
to which Requisite Lenders (or, if required pursuant to Subsection 10.6, all
Lenders) have otherwise consented, for which a Loan Party desires to obtain a
security interest release or a release of the Subsidiary Guaranty from
Administrative Agent, such Loan Party shall deliver an Officer's Certificate (i)
stating that the Collateral or the Capital Stock subject to such disposition is
being sold or otherwise disposed of in compliance with the terms hereof and (ii)
specifying the Collateral or Capital Stock being sold or otherwise disposed of
in the proposed transaction. Upon the receipt of such Officer's Certificate,
Administrative Agent shall, at such Loan Party's expense, so long as
Administrative Agent (a) has no reason to believe that the facts stated in such
Officer's Certificate are not true and correct, and (b) if the sale or other
disposition of such item of Collateral or Capital Stock constitutes an Asset
Sale, shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that arrangements
satisfactory to it have been made for delivery of the Net Asset Sale Proceeds if
and as required by Subsection 2.4, execute and deliver such releases of its
security interest in such Collateral or such Subsidiary Guaranty, as may be
reasonably

                                       145

requested by such Loan Party. Upon the payment in full of all Obligations, the
cancellation or termination of the Commitments and the cancellation or
expiration of all outstanding Letters of Credit (or the cash collateralization
thereof), each Subsidiary Guaranty and the security interests granted pursuant
to the Loan Documents (other than with respect to any cash collateral in respect
of Letters of Credit) shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall
revert to the applicable grantor Loan Parties. Upon any such termination
Administrative Agent will, at such Loan Party's expense, execute and deliver to
such Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party shall reasonably request to
evidence such termination.

                                       147

     T.   Confidentiality.
          ---------------

          Each Lender shall hold all non-public information obtained pursuant to
the requirements of this Agreement that has been identified in writing as
confidential by Borrower in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures
for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe
and sound banking practices, it being understood and agreed by Borrower that in
any event a Lender may make disclosures (a) to its Affiliates and to directors,
officers, employees and agents of such Lender and its Affiliates, including
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such information and instructed to keep such information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any Government Authority, (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Subsection X.T, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in,
or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual
counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or
prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative
transaction relating to obligations of Borrower, (g) with the consent of
Borrower, (h) to the extent such information (i) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Subsection X.T, or (ii) becomes
available to Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from
a source other than Borrower, or (i) to the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners or any other similar organization or any nationally recognized
rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender's or its
Affiliates' investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect
to such Lender or its Affiliates and that no written or oral communications from
counsel to an Agent and no information that is or is designated as privileged or
as attorney work product may be disclosed to any Person unless such Person is a
Lender or a participant hereunder; provided that, unless specifically prohibited
by applicable law or court order, each Lender shall notify Borrower of any
request by any Government Authority or representative thereof (other than any
such request in connection with any examination of the financial condition of
such Lender by such Government Authority) for disclosure of any such non-public
information prior to disclosure of such information; and provided, further, that
in no event shall any Lender be obligated or required to return any materials
furnished by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Borrower understands and agrees that
Administrative Agent and each of the institutions identified as "Co-Lead
Arranger" or "Co-Syndication Agent" on the title page to this Agreement may make
customary disclosures for advertising and "league table" purposes.

                                       148

<PAGE>

          Notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, Borrower and
Administrative Agent hereby agree that Borrower (and each of its employees,
representatives and agents) is permitted to disclose to any Person, the
structure and tax aspects of the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents, and all materials of any kind (including opinions and other tax
analyses) that are provided to Borrower related to such structure and tax
aspects. In this regard, Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Borrower's
disclosure of the structure or tax aspects of such transactions is not limited
in any way by an express or implied understanding or agreement, oral or written
(whether or not such agreement or understanding is legally binding).
Furthermore, Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it does not know or have
reason to know that its use or disclosure of information relating to the
structure or tax aspects of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents
is limited in any other manner for the benefit of any other Person.

     U.   Co- Lead Arrangers and Co-Syndication Agents.
          --------------------------------------------

          None of the institutions identified as "Co-Lead Arrangers" or
"Co-Syndication Agents" on the title page to this Agreement shall have any
obligations, liabilities or duties under this Agreement other than those
applicable to a Lender (but only if such institution is a Lender) as such, and
no such institution shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not
rely, on any such institution in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in
taking or not taking any action hereunder.

     V.   Counterparts; Effectiveness.
          ---------------------------

          This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements
hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of counterparts
and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may
be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single
counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same
document. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of a
counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto and receipt by Borrower and
Administrative Agent of written or telephonic notification of such execution and
authorization of delivery thereof.

     W.   Limitation of Liability.
          -----------------------

          Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible or
liable to any other party or any other person for consequential or punitive
damages that may be alleged as a result of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

     X.   Further Assurances.
          ------------------

          Each Loan Party agrees that from time to time, it shall, at its
expense, promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
all further agreements, documents and instruments, and do or cause to be done
all further acts as may be reasonably necessary or reasonably desirable, or that
Administrative Agent may reasonably request, in order to evidence,

                                       149

perfect, maintain and enforce any security interest granted or purported to be
granted by, or to otherwise effectuate the provisions or purposes of, this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and to enable Administrative Agent,
on behalf of the Lenders, to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
