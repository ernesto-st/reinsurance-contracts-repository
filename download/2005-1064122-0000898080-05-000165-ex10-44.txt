times of day shall be references to Eastern time (daylight or standard, as
applicable).

     1.06 Letter of Credit Amounts. Unless otherwise specified herein, the
amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated amount
of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however, that with
respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Issuer
Document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the
stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be
the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all
such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such
time.

                                  ARTICLE II.
                      THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS

     2.01 Loans.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender
severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Loan") to the Borrowers from
time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period, in an
aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such
Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any
Borrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate
Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Loans of any
Lender, plus such Lender's Applicable


                                       23
<PAGE>

Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, shall not exceed
such Lender's Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, and
subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow under
this Section 2.01, prepay under Section 2.04, and reborrow under this Section
2.01. Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided
herein.

     (b) Each Borrower shall have the right to request that repayment of its
Loans outstanding on the Commitment Termination Date be extended to the Maturity
Date (the "Term-Out Option") by giving the Administrative Agent written notice
of such election not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Commitment
Termination Date. The Administrative Agent shall promptly forward such request
to the Lenders. Provided that (x) no Default has occurred and is continuing and
(y) the conditions of Section 4.02 are satisfied, upon such request by a
Borrower, and payment of the fee referred to in Section 2.08(c), the payment
date of such Borrower's Loans outstanding on the Commitment Termination Date
(the "Term-Out Date") shall be extended to the Maturity Date and the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrowers and the Lenders of such Maturity
Date. Any Loans repaid after the Term-Out Date may not be reborrowed.

     2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.

     (a) Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other,
and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon a Borrower's
irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone.
Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than
11:00 a.m. (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing
of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion
of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of
any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each telephonic notice by a Borrower pursuant
to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the
Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately completed and
signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion
to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of
$5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as
provided in Sections 2.03(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in
excess thereof. Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify
(i) whether such Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from
one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the
requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be
(which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be
borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to
which existing Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of
the Interest Period with respect thereto. If a Borrower fails to specify a Type
of Loan in a Loan Notice or if a Borrower fails to give a timely notice
requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made
as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate
Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in
effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If a Borrower
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans
in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be
deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.


                                       24
<PAGE>

     (b) Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the
applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is
provided by the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described
in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make
the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately
available funds at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on
the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of
the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is
the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make
all funds so received available to such Borrower in like funds as received by
the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of such Borrower on
the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer
of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and
reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by such Borrower; provided,
however, that if, on the date the Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is
given by a Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding with respect to such
Borrower, then the proceeds of such Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the
payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available
to such Borrower as provided above.

     (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be
continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be
requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the
consent of the Required Lenders.

     (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower
and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that
Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrowers and the Lenders of any change in Bank of America's prime rate used in
determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such
change.

     (e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from
one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there
shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to Loans.

     2.03 Letters of Credit.

     (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment.

          (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C
     Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set forth in
     this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the
     Availability Period, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of SALIC,
     Scottish UK and Scottish US, and to amend Letters of Credit previously
     issued by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor
     drawings under the Letters of Credit (for purposes of this Section 2.03,
     "Borrowers" shall mean SALIC, Scottish US and Scottish UK collectively and
     a "Borrower" shall be any one of them); and (B) the Lenders severally agree
     to participate in Letters of Credit


                                       25
<PAGE>

     issued for the account of the Borrowers and any drawings thereunder;
     provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect
     to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the
     Aggregate Commitments and (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Loans
     of any Lender, plus such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding
     Amount of all L/C Obligations shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment.
     Each request by a Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of
     Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by such Borrower that the L/C
     Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the
     proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject
     to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers' ability to obtain
     Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrowers
     may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace
     Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and
     reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been
     issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be
     subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof. In no event
     shall Scottish Dublin be entitled to request Letters of Credit to be
     issued.

          (ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if:

               (A) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would
          occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance, unless the
          Lenders have approved such expiry date; or

          (iii) The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue any
     Letter of Credit if:

               (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority
          or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C
          Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to
          the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the
          force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
          the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain
          from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of
          Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect
          to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital
          requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated
          hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the
          L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
          applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith
          deems material to it;

               (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or
          more policies of the L/C Issuer;

               (C) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and
          the L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount
          less than $50,000;

               (D) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency
          other than Dollars;


                                       26
<PAGE>

               (E) such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic
          reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or

               (F) a default of any Lender's obligations to fund under Section
          2.03(c) exists or any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender
          hereunder, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into satisfactory
          arrangements with SALIC or such Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer's
          risk with respect to such Lender.

          (iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C
     Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit
     in its amended form under the terms hereof.

          (v) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of
     Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue
     such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B)
     the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed
     amendment to such Letter of Credit.

          (vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to
     any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith,
     and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A)
     provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts
     taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of
     Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents
     pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
     "Administrative Agent" as used in Article IX included the L/C Issuer with
     respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein
     with respect to the L/C Issuer.

     (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit.

          (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may
     be, upon the request of a Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy
     to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application,
     appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the
     applicable Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by
     the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at
     least two Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date or date of
     amendment, as the case may be; or in each case such later date and time as
     the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular
     instance in their sole discretion. In the case of a request for an initial
     issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall
     specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed
     issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business
     Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and
     address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by
     such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of
     any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
     thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In
     the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit,
     such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail
     satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B)
     the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C)
     the nature of the proposed


                                       27
<PAGE>

     amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.
     Additionally, the applicable Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and
     the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to
     such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer
     Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may require.

          (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the
     L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
     writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter
     of Credit Application from the applicable Borrower and, if not, the L/C
     Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless
     the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the
     Administrative Agent or any Borrower, at least one Business Day prior to
     the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of
     Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV
     shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions
     hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of
     Credit for the account of such Borrower or enter into the applicable
     amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C
     Issuer's usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the
     issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and
     hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C
     Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to
     the product of such Lender's Applicable Percentage times the amount of such
     Letter of Credit.

          (iii) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit (or any
     amendment thereto) to an advising bank with respect to such Letter of
     Credit or to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer will
     also deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true
     and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. The Administrative
     Agent shall provide notice to the Lenders within a reasonable time after
     any change to the L/C Obligations.

     (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

          (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any
     notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall
     notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not
     later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a
     Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the applicable Borrower
     shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an
     amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the applicable Borrower
     fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent
     shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the
     unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount of such
     Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the applicable
     Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans
     to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed
     Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section
     2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount
     of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions
     set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice). Any
     notice given by the L/C


                                       28
<PAGE>

     Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may
     be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that
     the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the
     conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

          (ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i)
     make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C
     Issuer at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its
     Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m.
     on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent,
     whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender
     that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan
     to the applicable Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall
     remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.

          (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully
     refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set
     forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the
     applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an
     L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so
     refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand
     (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In
     such event, each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed
     payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
     constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its
     participation obligation under this Section 2.03.

          (iv) Until each Lender funds its Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this
     Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any
     Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Applicable
     Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C
     Issuer.

          (v) Each Lender's obligation to make Loans or L/C Advances to
     reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as
     contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional
     and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff,
     counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
     against the L/C Issuer, SALIC, the applicable Borrower or, any Subsidiary
     thereof or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence
     or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or
     condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided,
     however, that each Lender's obligation to make Loans pursuant to this
     Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02
     (other than delivery of a Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance
     shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower
     to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C
     Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided
     herein.

          (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent
     for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such
     Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the
     time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii),


                                       29
<PAGE>

     the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting
     through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest
     thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date
     on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate
     per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A
     certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the
     Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause
     (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     (d) Repayment of Participations.

          (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any
     Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance
     in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the
     Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment
     in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether
     directly from a Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash
     Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative
     Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof
     (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the
     period of time during which such Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) and
     in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.

          (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be
     returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05
     (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its
     discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of
     the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such
     demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per
     annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The
     obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in
     full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

     (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the applicable Borrower to
reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued for
such Borrower's account and to repay each related L/C Borrowing shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including
the following:

          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit,
     this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;

          (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or
     other right that any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any
     time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or
     any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be
     acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with
     this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of
     Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated
     transaction;


                                       30
<PAGE>

          (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under
     such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
     insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
     inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or
     otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such
     Letter of Credit;

          (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against
     presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with
     the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer
     under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in
     bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
     liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any
     beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any
     arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

          (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
     similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that
     might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

The applicable Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit
and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any
claim of noncompliance with such Borrower's instructions or other irregularity,
such Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The applicable Borrower
shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C
Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

     (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and each Borrower agrees that, in
paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any
responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates
and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or
inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of
the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer,
the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any
correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any
Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request
or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii)
any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or
Issuer Document. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions
of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit
issued for its account; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended
to, and shall not, preclude such Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as
it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other
agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their
respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the
L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in
clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in
such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicable Borrower may have a
claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the applicable
Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the applicable Borrower which
the applicable Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful
misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under
any Letter


                                       31
<PAGE>

of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of
Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer
may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason.

     (g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, if the
L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of
Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, the applicable
Borrower shall, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of
all such Borrower's L/C Obligations. Sections 2.04 and 8.02(c) set forth certain
additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of
this Section 2.03, Section 2.04 and Section 8.02(c), "Cash Collateralize" means
to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations
of the applicable Borrower, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to
documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and
the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders).
Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. Each Borrower hereby
grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the
Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances
therein of such Borrower and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral
shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of
America.

     (h) Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C
Issuer and SALIC when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement
applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to
each Letter of Credit.

     (i) Letter of Credit Fees. Each Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage, a Letter of Credit fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") for each Letter
of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower equal to the Applicable Rate
times of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For
purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of
Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance
with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) computed on a quarterly
basis in arrears and (ii) due and payable on the first Business Day after the
end of each March, June, September and December, commencing on the first
Business Day after the end of March 2005 and thereafter commencing with the
first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit and on the
date the last Letter of Credit expires. If there is any change in the Applicable
Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each
Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate
separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in
effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the
request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter
of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate.


                                       32
<PAGE>

     (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C
Issuer. Each Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account,
a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for the account of
such Borrower, at the rate per annum agreed to between SALIC and such L/C
Issuer, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears, and due and payable on the first
Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter
of Credit and on the date the last Letter of Credit expires. For purposes of
computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the
amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section
1.06. In addition, each Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its
own account, the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other
processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer
relating to letters of credit issued for the account of such Borrower as from
time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are
due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

     (k) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between
the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall
control.

     2.04 Prepayments. (a) Each Borrower may, upon notice from such Borrower to
the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay
its Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such
notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.
(A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate
Loans, and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment
of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate
Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000
in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof
then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such
prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Loans are
to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent
will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the
amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice
is given by a Borrower, the applicable Borrower shall make such prepayment and
the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied
by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional
amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied
to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable
Percentages.

     (b) If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the
Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrowers shall immediately prepay
Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal
to such excess; provided, however, that the Borrowers shall not be required to
Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) unless
after the prepayment in full of the Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the
Aggregate Commitments then in effect.

     2.05 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. SALIC may, upon notice to the
Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time
permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice
shall be received by the


                                       33
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the
date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof, and (iii) SALIC shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments
if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the
Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments. The Administrative
Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or
reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate
Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender pro rata according
to its Applicable Percentage. All fees accrued until the effective date of any
termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of
such termination.

     2.06 Repayment of Loans. Each Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the
Commitment Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans made to such
Borrower outstanding on such date unless such Borrower has requested the
Term-Out Option and the conditions thereto satisfied. If the Term-Out Option has
been requested and the conditions thereto satisfied, each Borrower exercising
its Term-Out Option shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the
aggregate principal amount of its Loans outstanding on such date.

     2.07 Interest.

     (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar
Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for
each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable
Rate.

     (b) (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due
(without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

          (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by a
     Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to
     any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
     or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount
     shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at
     all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
     applicable Laws.

          (iii) Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of
     Default exists, the Borrowers shall pay interest on the principal amount of
     all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per
     annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent
     permitted by applicable Laws.

          (iv) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including
     interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.

     (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest


                                       34
<PAGE>

hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before
and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding
under any Debtor Relief Law.

     2.08 Fees. In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i) and (j)
of Section 2.03:

     (a) Facility Fee. SALIC shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a facility
fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate
Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the
Outstanding Amount of all Loans and L/C Obligations), regardless of usage. The
facility fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and
thereafter so long as any Loans or L/C Obligations remain outstanding),
including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV
is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last
Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing on the last
Business Day of March, 2005, and on the Commitment Termination Date or, if the
Term-Out Option has been exercised, the Maturity Date (and, if applicable,
thereafter on demand). The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in
arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter,
the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate
separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in
effect.

     (b) Utilization Fee. SALIC shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a
utilization fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the Total Outstandings on
each day that the Total Outstandings exceed 50% of the actual daily amount of
the Aggregate Commitments then in effect (or, if terminated, in effect
immediately prior to such termination). The utilization fee shall be due and
payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing on the last Business Day of March, 2005, and
on the Commitment Termination Date or, if the Term-Out Option has been
exercised, the Maturity Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand). The
utilization fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears and if there is any
change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount shall be
computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate for each period during which such
Applicable Rate was in effect. The utilization fee shall accrue at all times,
including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV
is not met.

     (c) Term-Out Fee. In the event a Borrower exercises its Term-Out Option,
such Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a fee equal to 0.15% of the
principal amount of the Loans as to which such Borrower has exercised its
Term-Out Option.

     (d) Other Fees. (i) SALIC shall pay to the Arranger and the Administrative
Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times
specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall
not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.


                                       35
<PAGE>

     (ii) SALIC shall pay to the Lenders such upfront fees as shall have been
separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.
Such upfront fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable
for any reason whatsoever.

     2.09 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for
Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America's "prime
rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall
be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in
more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis
of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the
Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the
day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is
repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.11(a),
bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an
interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

     2.10 Evidence of Debt. (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall
be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by
the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or
records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be
conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by
the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure
to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise
affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with
respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts
and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the
Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the
Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the
request of any Lender to a Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, such
Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative
Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans to such Borrower in
addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note
and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and
maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

     (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a),
each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such
Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the
accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and
records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest
error.

     2.11 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent's Clawback. (a) General. All
payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or
deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder
shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective
Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's
Office in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date
specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each
Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein)
of such payment in like funds as


                                       36
<PAGE>

received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received
by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall in each case be deemed
received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee
shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come
due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next
following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in
computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

     (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a
Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to
the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower
severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of
the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in
accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the
case of a payment to be made by the applicable Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall
pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping
period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable Borrower
the amount of such interest paid by the applicable Borrower for such period. If
such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative
Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in
such Borrowing. Any payment by the applicable Borrower shall be without
prejudice to any claim the applicable Borrower may have against a Lender that
shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

     (ii) Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such
payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the
amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment,
then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees
to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

     A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect
to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error.


                                       37
<PAGE>

     (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available
to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any
Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such
funds are not made available to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent
because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article
IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received
from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

     (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders
hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make
payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of
any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any
payment under Section 11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve
any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its
Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section
11.04(c).

     (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender
to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to
constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain
the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

     2.12 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any
right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it, or the participations
in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a
proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued
interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein,
then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the
other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the
benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:

          (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and
     all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
     participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase
     price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and

          (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to
     (x) any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the
     express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as
     consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of
     its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or
     participant, other than to a Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to
     which the provisions of this Section shall apply).

     Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing


                                       38
<PAGE>

arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

     2.13 Several Obligations of Borrowers; SALIC as Agent of Borrowers.

     (a) The Obligations of Scottish US, Scottish UK and Scottish Dublin shall
be several in nature. In no event shall Scottish Dublin be liable to the LC
Issuer or the Lenders for any Obligations with respect to any Letters of Credit.

     (b) Each of Scottish UK, Scottish Dublin and Scottish US hereby irrevocably
appoints SALIC as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each
of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of notices,
and (ii) the execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and
certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto. Any
acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification or other action which might
otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by all Borrowers, or by
each Borrower acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only
by SALIC, whether or not any such other Borrower joins therein. Any notice,
demand, consent, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other
communication delivered to SALIC in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been delivered to each other Borrower.

     2.14 Increase in Commitments.

     (a) Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to
the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), SALIC may on
a one-time basis, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an amount
not exceeding $25,000,000; provided that any such request for an increase shall
be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000. At the time of sending such notice, SALIC
(in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period
within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be
less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the
Lenders).

     (b) Lender Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall notify the
Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to
increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than,
or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender
not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to
increase its Commitment.

     (c) Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall notify SALIC and each Lender of the Lenders'
responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a
requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and
the L/C Issuer (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), SALIC may
also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a
joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
and its counsel.

     (d) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Aggregate Commitments are
increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and SALIC
shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and the final
allocation of such increase. The


                                       39
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent shall promptly notify SALIC and the Lenders of the final
allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.

     (e) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition precedent to
such increase, SALIC shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of
each Borrower dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for
each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower (i) certifying and
attaching the resolutions adopted by such Borrower approving or consenting to
such increase, and (ii) in the case of SALIC, certifying that, before and after
giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained
in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the
Extension Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and
warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true
and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this
Section 2.14, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a)
and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements
furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01, and
(B) no Default exists. The Borrowers shall prepay any Loans outstanding on the
Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with
any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the
Commitments under this Section.

     (f) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in
Sections 2.12 or 11.01 to the contrary.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

     3.01 Taxes.

     (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the respective Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding
for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the applicable
Borrower shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes
(including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall
be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section)
the Administrative Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall
timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

     (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers. Without limiting the
provisions of subsection (a) above, each Borrower shall timely pay any Other
Taxes attributable to such Borrower's Obligations to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (c) Indemnification by the Borrowers. Each Borrower shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, within 10 days after
demand therefor, for


                                       40
<PAGE>

the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable
under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be, with respect to such Borrower's Obligations and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a
Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority
with respect to such Borrower's Obligations, such Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.

     (e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
a Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such
jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall deliver to SALIC (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by
SALIC or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any
Lender, if requested by SALIC or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such
other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by
SALIC or the Administrative Agent as will enable SALIC or the Administrative
Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding
or information reporting requirements.

     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a
Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender
shall deliver to SALIC and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as
shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the request of SALIC or the Administrative Agent, but only if
such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is
applicable:

          (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN
     claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the
     United States is a party,

          (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,

          (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the
     exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a
     certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank"
     within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent
     shareholder" of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of


                                       41
<PAGE>

     section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation"
     described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies
     of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or

          (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
     claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding
     tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be
     prescribed by applicable law to permit SALIC to determine the withholding
     or deduction required to be made.

     Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding
delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for
U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the
Administrative Agent or SALIC, as the Administrative Agent or SALIC shall
reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion
thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing
authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and
completed by such Lender, as are required under such Laws to confirm such
Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of,
applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such
Lender outside of the U.S. by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such
other jurisdiction. Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative
Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any
such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be
materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and
as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending
Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction
that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts
payable to such Lender. Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly
deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent
or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in
a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant
taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and
completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or
the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in
connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.

     (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender
or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a
refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any
Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts
pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such
refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts
paid, by such Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other
Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Borrower, upon the
request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to
repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or
other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such


                                       42
<PAGE>

refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to
require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available
its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems
confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.

     3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund
Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions
on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of,
Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender
to SALIC through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make
or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar
Rate Loans, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative
Agent and SALIC that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no
longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, upon demand from
such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or convert all
such Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last
day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to
maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender
may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such
prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the
amount so prepaid or converted.

     3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Required Lenders determine that
for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a
conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being
offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and
Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means
do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest
Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar
Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar
Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so
notify SALIC and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make
or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative
Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon
receipt of such notice, SALIC may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of,
conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be
deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base
Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

     3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.

     (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

          (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit,
     compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of,
     deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in
     by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section
     3.04(e)) or the L/C Issuer;


                                       43
<PAGE>

          (ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any kind
     whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any
     participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or
     change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer
     in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by
     Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any
     Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer); or

          (iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank
     market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or
     Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
     participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or
of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of
Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other
amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, SALIC will pay (or
cause the applicable Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the
case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or
the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or
reduction suffered.

     (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that
any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office
of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any,
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or
participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of
Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the
L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or
the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's
holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time SALIC
will pay (or cause the applicable Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding
company for any such reduction suffered.

     (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the L/C
Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender
or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to SALIC shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. SALIC shall pay (or cause the applicable Borrower to pay)
such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

     (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right
to demand such compensation, provided that no


                                       44
<PAGE>

Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to
the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or
reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or
the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies SALIC of the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C
Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in
Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof).

     (e) Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. Each Borrower shall pay to each
Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with
respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurodollar funds or
deposits (currently known as "Eurodollar liabilities"), additional interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan of such Borrower equal
to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as
determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be
conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is
payable on such Loan, provided such Borrower shall have received at least 10
days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional
interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the
relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and
payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.

     3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, each Borrower shall promptly compensate
such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense
incurred by it as a result of:

     (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan to such
Borrower other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

     (b) any failure by such Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of
such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by such
Borrower; or

     (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last
day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by such Borrower
pursuant to Section 11.13;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
The applicable Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged
by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by a Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit
or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was
in fact so funded.


                                       45
<PAGE>

     3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

     (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 3.04, or any Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign
its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04,
as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant
to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. SALIC hereby agrees to pay (or to cause the
applicable Borrower to pay) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any
Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

     (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01, SALIC may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.13.

     3.07 Survival. All of the Borrowers' obligations under this Article III
shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all
other Obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV.
                    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS

     4.01 Conditions of Closing Date. The occurrence of the Closing Date is
subject to satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

     other Loan Documents to which such Borrower is a party;


                                       46

     reasonably require to evidence that each Borrower is duly incorporated or
     organized or formed, and that each Borrower is validly existing, in good
     standing (if such concept is applicable) and qualified to engage in
     business in each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of
     properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification,
     except to the extent that failure to do so could not reasonably be expected
     to have a Material Adverse Effect;

          (v) a favorable opinion of (i) LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, U.S.

<PAGE>

          (xiii) such other assurances, certificates, documents, consents or

     (c) Unless waived by the Administrative Agent, SALIC shall have paid all

extent invoiced prior to or on the Closing Date, plus such additional amounts of
such fees, charges and disbursements as shall constitute its reasonable estimate

the closing proceedings (provided that such estimate shall not thereafter
preclude a final settling of accounts between SALIC and the Administrative
Agent).

     (d) The ING Reinsurance Agreements shall be in form and substance

consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or
other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable

     4.02 Conditions to all Credit Extensions. The obligation of each Lender to
honor any Request for Credit Extension (other than a Loan Notice requesting only
a conversion of Loans to the other Type, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate
Loans) is subject to the following conditions precedent:

     (a) The representations and warranties of (i) the Borrowers contained in
Article V and (ii) each Borrower contained in each other Loan Document or in any
document furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith,
shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such
Credit Extension, except to the extent that such representations and warranties
specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and
correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section
4.02, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of
Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished
pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01.

     (b) No Default shall exist, or would result from such proposed Credit
Extension or the application of the proceeds thereof.

     (c) The Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the L/C Issuer shall have
received a Request for Credit Extension in accordance with the requirements
hereof.

     Each Request for Credit Extension (other than a Loan Notice requesting only
a conversion of Loans to the other Type or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate
Loans) submitted by a Borrower shall be deemed to be a representation and
warranty that the conditions specified in Sections 4.02(a) and (b) have been
satisfied on and as of the date of the applicable Credit Extension.

                                   ARTICLE V.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Each Borrower represents and warrants (provided that Scottish Dublin,
Scottish US and Scottish UK each represents and warrants solely with respect to

          (iii) Calculation of SALIC Financial Covenants. For purposes of

<PAGE>

     (a) declare the commitment of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation
of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions to be terminated, whereupon such
commitments and obligation shall be terminated;

     (b) declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans, all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable
hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers;

     (c) require that each Borrower Cash Collateralize its L/C Obligations (in
an amount equal to the then Outstanding Amount thereof); and

     (d) exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and remedies
available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an
order for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the
United States, the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of
the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions shall automatically terminate, the
unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest and other
amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and the
obligation of each Borrower to Cash Collateralize its L/C Obligations as
aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further act
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

     8.03 Application of Funds. After the exercise of remedies provided for in
Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and
payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash
Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02), any amounts
received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent in the following order:

     First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including fees, charges and
disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and amounts payable under
Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such;

     Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable to the
Lenders and the L/C Issuer (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel
to the respective Lenders and the L/C Issuer (including, without duplication,
fees and time charges for attorneys who may be employees of any Lender or the
L/C Issuer) and amounts payable under Article III), ratably among them in
proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;

     Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued
and unpaid interest on the Loans, L/C Borrowings and other Obligations, ratably
among the Lenders and the L/C Issuer in proportion to the respective amounts
described in this clause Third payable to them;


                                       70
<PAGE>

     Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid
principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders and the L/C
Issuer in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth
held by them;

     Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, to
Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate
undrawn amount of Letters of Credit; and

     Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been
indefeasibly paid in full, to the applicable Borrower or as otherwise required
by Law.

Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate
undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fifth above shall be
applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any
amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have
either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to
the other Obligations of the applicable Borrower, if any, in the order set forth
above.

                                   ARTICLE IX.
                                      AGENT

     9.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer
hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the
Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes
the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such
powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or
thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and no Borrower shall have
rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.

     9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person
serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such
Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in
any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and
without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

     9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any
duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other
Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent:

          (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties,
     regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

          (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
     exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
     expressly contemplated


                                       71
<PAGE>

     hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is
     required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or
     such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly
     provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the
     Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its
     opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent
     to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law;
     and

          (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other
     Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
     failure to disclose, any information relating to any of the Borrowers or
     any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by
     the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
     any capacity.

     The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or
such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the
Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
circumstances as provided in Sections 11.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall
be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice
describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by SALIC, a Lender
or the L/C Issuer.

     The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction
of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

     9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any
notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other
writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting
or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed,
sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability
for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to
the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms
must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the
Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such
Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of
such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for a Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for


                                       72
<PAGE>

any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

     9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all
of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other
Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this
Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

     9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may at
any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and
SALIC. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders
shall have the right, in consultation with SALIC, to appoint a successor, which
shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such
bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been
so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders
and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the
qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall
notify SALIC and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such
appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in
accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the
Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such
collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is
appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to
be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or
to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this
Section. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired)
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this
Section). The fees payable by SALIC to a successor Administrative Agent shall be
the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between
SALIC and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and
Section 11.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the
retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

     Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer. Upon the acceptance
of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such
successor shall succeed to and become


                                       73
<PAGE>

vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C
Issuer, (b) the retiring L/C Issuer shall be discharged from all of their
respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents,
and (c) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution
for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or
make other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively
assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters
of Credit.

     9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related
Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

     9.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
none of the Bookrunners, Arrangers or co-syndication agents listed on the cover
page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as
applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder.

     9.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency
of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to
any Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of
any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or
by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent
shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

          (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal
     and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and
     all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
     documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of
     the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any
     claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances
     of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their
     respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the
     L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(i) and (j),
     2.08 and 11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

          (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
     deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make


                                       74
<PAGE>

such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the
Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to
the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount
due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.08 and 11.04.

     Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or
the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to
authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender
in any such proceeding.

                                   ARTICLE X.
                                 SALIC GUARANTEE

     10.01 Unconditional Guarantee. For valuable consideration, receipt whereof
is hereby acknowledged, and to induce the L/C Issuer and each Lender to make
Credit Extensions to and on account of Scottish US, Scottish Dublin and Scottish
UK (individually a "Guaranteed Borrower" and collectively the "Guaranteed
Borrowers") and to induce the Administrative Agent to act hereunder, SALIC
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each Lender, the L/C Issuer
and the Administrative Agent the punctual payment when due, whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Guaranteed
Borrowers, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses, indemnification or
otherwise, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent or now existing or
hereafter arising (such Obligations being the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, SALIC's liability shall extend to all
amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by
any of the Guaranteed Borrowers to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or
any Lender under this Agreement but for the fact that they are unenforceable or
not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding involving such Guaranteed Borrower. This is a guarantee of payment
and not of collection merely.

     10.02 Guarantee Absolute. SALIC guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations
will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, regardless
of any Law or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any
of such terms or the rights of any Lender or the Administrative Agent or the L/C
Issuer with respect thereto. The Obligations of SALIC under this Article X are
independent of the Guaranteed Obligations, and a separate action or actions may
be brought and prosecuted against SALIC to enforce this Article X, irrespective
of whether any action is brought against any of the Guaranteed Borrowers or
whether any of the Guaranteed Borrowers is joined in any such action or actions.
The liability of SALIC under this guarantee shall be irrevocable, absolute and
unconditional irrespective of, and SALIC hereby irrevocably waives any defense
it may now or hereafter have in any way relating to, any or all of the
following:

     (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other
agreement or instrument relating thereto;


                                       75
<PAGE>

     (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other
term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other amendment or
waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement;

     (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral or
any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any
other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

     (d) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or
existence of any of the Guaranteed Borrowers; or

     (e) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of
limitations to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law) which might
otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, SALIC, any of
the Guaranteed Borrowers or a guarantor.

     This guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the
Administrative Agent upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any of
the Guaranteed Borrowers or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been
made.

     10.03 Waivers. SALIC hereby expressly waives promptness, diligence, notice
of acceptance, presentment, demand for payment, protest, any requirement that
any right or power be exhausted or any action be taken against any of the
Guaranteed Borrowers or against any other guarantor of all or any portion of the
Guaranteed Obligations, and all other notices and demands whatsoever.

     (a) SALIC hereby waives any right to revoke this guaranty, and acknowledges
that this guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed
Obligations, whether existing now or in the future and regardless of whether the
Guaranteed Obligations is reduced to zero at any time or from time to time.

     (b) SALIC acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect
benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated herein and that the
waivers set forth in this Article X are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

     10.04 Subrogation. SALIC will not exercise any rights that it may now or
hereafter acquire against any of the Guaranteed Borrowers or any other insider
guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of
the Guaranteed Obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or
indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any other Lender against a Guaranteed
Borrower or any other insider guarantor or any collateral, whether or not such
claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common
law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any of the
Guaranteed Borrowers or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in
cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security
on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the
Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this guaranty shall
have been paid in full in cash and the


                                       76
<PAGE>

Commitments shall have terminated. If any amount shall be paid to SALIC in
violation of the preceding sentence at any time prior to the later of the
payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this guaranty and the termination of the Commitments, such amount
shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C
Issuer and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent
to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed
Obligations or other amounts payable under this guaranty thereafter arising.
SALIC acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the
financing arrangements contemplated by this Agreement and that the waiver set

                                       79
<PAGE>

remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and
privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

     11.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or
waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated). Each Borrower shall pay
(i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the L/C Issuer in
connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit issued for such Borrower's account or any demand for payment thereunder
and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any

without duplication, all fees and time charges for attorneys who may be
employees of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, in

including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans
made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket
expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect
of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

     (b) Indemnification by Borrowers. Each Borrower shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender and the L/C
Issuer, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person
being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from,
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including
the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), and,
without duplication, shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee from all
fees and time charges and disbursements for attorneys who may be employees of

result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby by such
Borrower, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations
hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, (ii) any Loan made to or Letter of Credit issued for the
account of such Borrower or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom
(including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a
Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do
not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual
or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property
owned or operated by such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any

                                       80
<PAGE>

claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third
party or by such Borrower, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party
thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by
final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim brought by such
Borrower against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee's
obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if such Borrower has
obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

     (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that any Borrower for any
reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b)
of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent
thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each
Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such
sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such
Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount,
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in
its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing
acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or L/C Issuer in
connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this
subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.11(d).

     (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, no Borrower shall assert, and hereby waives, any claim
against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the
use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above
shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of
any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications,
electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

     (f) Survival. The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation
of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, the replacement of any Lender,
the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all the other Obligations.

     11.05 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of
any Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender,
or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of
setoff, and such


                                       81
<PAGE>

payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent,
the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor
Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation
or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such
setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees
to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without
duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such
payment is made at a rate per annum equal to Federal Funds Rate from time to
time in effect, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The
obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding
sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.

     11.06 Successors and Assigns.

     (a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower may
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no
Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions
of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge
or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection
(f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party
hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto,
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the
extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent,
the L/C Issuer and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under or by reason of this Agreement.

     (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or
more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
(including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C
Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that

          (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount
     of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it
     or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or
     an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the
     Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder)
     or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding
     balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
     assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with
     respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if
     "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
     Date, shall not be less than


                                       82
<PAGE>

     $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event
     of Default has occurred and is continuing, SALIC otherwise consents (each
     such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

          (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
     proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned;

          (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the
     Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (such approval not to be
     unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the Person that is the proposed
     assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would
     otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and

          (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
     processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee, if it
     shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
     Administrative Questionnaire

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a
party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 11.04 with
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment. Upon request, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
subsection (d) of this Section.

     (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as
an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by each of the Borrowers and the L/C Issuer at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition,
at any time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to
the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender wishing to consult with other Lenders
in connection therewith may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a
copy of the Register.


                                       83
<PAGE>

     (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
notice to, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any
Person (other than a natural person or SALIC or any of SALIC's Affiliates or
Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C
Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C
Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.

     Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 11.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this
Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.12 as though it were a
Lender.

     (e) Limitation upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled
to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable
Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with SALIC's prior written consent. A Participant that would
be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 3.01 unless SALIC is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to
comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender.

     (f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note(s), if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

     (g) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words "execution," "signed,"
"signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be
deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic
form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based
recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in
any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act,
or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions
Act.


                                       84
<PAGE>

     (h) Resignation as L/C Issuer after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its
Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, upon
30 days' notice to SALIC and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer. In the event of
any such resignation as L/C Issuer, SALIC shall be entitled to appoint from
among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no
failure by SALIC to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of
Bank of America as L/C Issuer. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it
shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with
respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its
resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto
(including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk
participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)).

     11.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates' respective
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and representatives
(it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep
such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory
authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the
exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i)
any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant
in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or
prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction
relating to a Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of SALIC or (h)
to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective
Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Borrower.

     For purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received
from a Borrower or any Subsidiary thereon relating to a Borrower or any
Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective businesses, other than any such
information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C
Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by a Borrower or any
Subsidiary thereof, provided that, in the case of information received from a
Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof after the date hereof, such information is
clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required
to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall
be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

     11.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates
is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, after obtaining the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,


                                       85
<PAGE>

to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in
whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency)
at any time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for
the credit or the account of any Borrower against any and all of the obligations
of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not
such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document and although such obligations of such Borrower may be
contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the
L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated
on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their
respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or
their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to
notify SALIC and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and
application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such setoff and application.

     11.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the
Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest
permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative Agent or
any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate,
the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it
exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable Borrower. In
determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the
Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not
principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate,
allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest
throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

     11.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall
have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent
shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

     11.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the


                                       86
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain
unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

     11.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality,
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the
parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of
which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

     11.13 Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or if any other
circumstance exists hereunder that gives SALIC the right to replace a Lender as
a party hereto, then SALIC may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to
such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.06), all of its interests,
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an
assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:

     (a) SALIC shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee
specified in Section 11.06(b);

     (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the
outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon,
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to
the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the
applicable Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

     (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments thereafter; and

     (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.

     A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation
if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling SALIC to require such assignment and delegation cease to
apply.

     11.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.

     (a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AGAINST ANY
BORROWER OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.

     (c) WAIVER OF VENUE. EACH BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW
OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY COURT
REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING
IN ANY SUCH COURT.

     (D) SERVICE OF PROCESS. ON OR PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE, THE BORROWER SHALL
APPOINT CT CORPORATION SYSTEM (THE "PROCESS AGENT"), WITH AN OFFICE ON THE DATE
HEREOF AT 111 EIGHTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10011, UNITED STATES, AS ITS AGENT TO

     11.15 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

     11.16 USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as
hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf
of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements
of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26,
2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of
each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify such Borrower in accordance
with the Act.

     11.17 Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any
court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document
in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that
at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent
could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day
preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of each Borrower
in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any
judgment in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than that in which such
sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that on
the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in
accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with
the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is
less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from any Borrower
in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the
Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return
the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be
entitled thereto under applicable law).
