certain legal and equitable rights and remedies, including, without limitation, the forfeiture of
the Award(s) and any other awards granted to me (whether before or after the Award(s)) under the
SIP. The forfeiture of such Award(s) will also apply where I fail to give the full amount of notice
by exercising any right I may have under applicable legislation to make a payment in lieu of such
notice. The Firm may hold me personally liable for any damages that it suffers as a result of the

Inc., and myself. I have received and agree to be bound by the Custody Agreement (or any other such
custody agreement previously entered into by me or on my behalf), including the applicable
restrictions on transfers, pledges and withdrawals of shares of the common stock of GS Inc.
(&#147;Shares&#148;), the provisions permitting the Firm to monitor my custody account, and the limitations
on the liability of BNY Mellon and the Firm. I also agree to open an account with any other
custodian or broker selected by the Firm, if the Firm, in its sole discretion, requires me to open
an account with such custodian or broker as a condition to delivery of Shares (or cash or other

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which limits the Firm&#146;s ability to offset in the case of
United States taxpayers under certain circumstances), any outstanding amounts that I then owe the
Firm against its delivery obligations under the Award(s) or against any other amounts the Firm then
owes me. I understand that the delivery of Shares pursuant to the Award(s) is conditioned on my
satisfaction of any applicable taxes or social security contributions (collectively referred to as
&#147;tax&#148; or &#147;taxes&#148; for purposes of the SIP and all related documents) in accordance with the SIP. To
the extent permitted by applicable law, the Firm, in its sole discretion, may require me to provide
amounts equal to all or a portion of any Federal, State, local, foreign or other tax obligations
imposed on me or the Firm in connection with the grant, vesting or delivery of the Award(s) by
requiring me to choose between remitting such amount (i)&nbsp;in cash (or through payroll deduction or
otherwise), (ii)&nbsp;in the form of proceeds from the Firm&#146;s executing a sale of Shares delivered to me
pursuant to the Award(s) or (iii)&nbsp;as otherwise permitted in the Award Agreement(s). However, in no
event shall any such choice or the choice specified in paragraph 6, below, determine, or give me
any discretion to affect, the timing of the delivery of Shares or payment of tax obligations.

require (to the extent permitted by applicable law) that I provide for a reserve in an amount the
Firm determines is advisable or necessary in connection with any actual, anticipated or potential
tax consequences related to my separate employment contracts by requiring me to choose between
remitting such amount (i)&nbsp;in cash (or through payroll deductions or otherwise) or (ii)&nbsp;in the form
of proceeds from the Firm&#146;s executing a sale of Shares delivered to me pursuant to the <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Award(s)</FONT> (or

such other electronic means as the Firm and I may agree) all notices and information that the Firm
is required by law to send to me in connection therewith including, without limitation, any

relating to the delivery of any such document in physical form are hereby revoked and superseded. I
agree to check Goldman Sachs&#146; intranet site (or, if I am no longer employed by the Firm, such other
electronic site as the Firm and I may agree) periodically as I deem appropriate for any new notices
or information concerning the SIP. I understand that I am not required to consent to the receipt of
such documents in electronic form in order to receive the Award(s) and that I may decline to
receive such documents in electronic form by contacting Equity Compensation (division of HCM), 30
