to cause the roof warranty material provider to acknowledge the transfer of the
Property roof warranty to Buyer or to obtain a REA estoppel certificate from all
parties to any reciprocal easement agreement, declaration, and/or association
which benefits and/or burdens the Property shall not be considered a default
under this Agreement.

     SECTION 3.2    NO LIABILITY FOR EXCEPTION MATTERS.

     As used herein, the term "EXCEPTION MATTER" shall refer to a matter which
would make a representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement
untrue or incorrect and which is disclosed to Buyer in the Due Diligence
Materials, the Disclosure Items, or otherwise, or is a matter of public record,
or is otherwise discovered by Buyer before the Closing, including, without
limitation, matters disclosed in any tenant estoppel certificate or from
interviews with tenants, property managers or any other person. If Buyer first
obtains knowledge of any material Exception Matter after the close of the
Contingency Period and prior to Closing and such Exception Matter was not
contained in the Due Diligence Materials, the Disclosure Items or is not a
matter of public record, Buyer's sole remedy shall be to terminate this
Agreement on the basis thereof, upon written notice to Seller and Escrowee
within the earlier of (a) five (5) days following Buyer's discovery of such
Exception Matter or (b) the Closing, which ever occurs first, in which event the
Deposit shall immediately be returned to Buyer, unless within five (5) days
after receipt of such notice or by the Closing, as the case may be, Seller
notifies Buyer in writing that it elects to attempt to cure or remedy such
Exception Matter, in which event there shall be no return of the Deposit unless
and until Seller is unable to so cure or remedy within the time period set forth
below. Seller shall be entitled to extend the Closing Date (as defined in
Section 8.2 below) for up to fifteen (15) business days in order to attempt to
cure or remedy any Exception Matter. Buyer's failure to give notice within five
(5) days after it has obtained knowledge of a material Exception Matter shall be
deemed a waiver by Buyer of such Exception Matter. Seller shall have no
obligation to cure or remedy any Exception Matter, even if Seller has notified
Buyer of Seller's election to attempt to cure or remedy any Exception Matter
(except as specifically provided in Section 4.1(c) hereof), and, subject to
Buyer's right to terminate this Agreement as set forth above, Seller shall have
no liability whatsoever to Buyer with respect to any Exception Matters. Upon any
termination of this Agreement, neither party shall have any further rights nor
obligations hereunder, except as provided in Sections 6.1, 9.3 and 9.9 below. If
Buyer obtains knowledge of any Exception Matter before the Closing, but
nonetheless elects to proceed with the acquisition of the Property, Seller shall
have no liability with respect to such Exception Matter, notwithstanding any
contrary provision, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or in any Other Documents (as defined in Section 9.19 below). For the
purposes of this section 3.2, "Buyer's knowledge" shall be defined as the actual
knowledge of Mark Youngman after review of the Due Diligence Materials, the
Disclosure Items, matter of public record, and matters disclosed; (i) in any
tenant estoppel certificate, (ii) in any third party reports ordered by Buyer or
its agents, or (iii) from interviews conducted by Buyer or its agents with
tenants, property managers or any other person.

     SECTION 3.3    SURVIVAL OF SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SALE.

     The representations and warranties of Seller contained herein or in any
Seller estoppel delivered pursuant to Section 8.4 below or in any Other
Documents shall survive for a period of six (6) months after the Closing. Any
claim which Buyer may have against Seller for a breach of any such
representation or warranty, whether such breach is known or unknown, which is
not specifically asserted by written notice to Seller within such six (6) month
period shall not be valid or effective, and Seller shall have no liability with
respect thereto.

     SECTION 3.4    SELLER'S KNOWLEDGE.

     For purposes of this Agreement and any document delivered at Closing,
whenever the phrase "TO THE BEST OF SELLER'S KNOWLEDGE" or the "KNOWLEDGE" of
Seller or words of similar import are used, they shall be deemed to mean and are
limited to the current actual knowledge only of Peter F. Feinberg and LaRee
Stein, at the times indicated only, and not any implied, imputed or constructive
knowledge of such individual(s) or of Seller or any Seller Related Parties (as
defined in Section 3.7 below), and without any independent investigation or
inquiry having been made or any implied duty to investigate, make any inquiries
or review the Due Diligence Materials. Furthermore, it is understood and agreed
that such individual(s) shall have no personal liability in any manner
whatsoever hereunder or otherwise related to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

     SECTION 3.5    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER.

     Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

qualified to do business in the state in which the Real Property is located.
This Agreement has been, and all documents executed by Buyer which are to be
delivered to Seller at Closing will be, duly authorized, executed and delivered
by Buyer.

             (d)    Buyer is purchasing the Property as investment rental
property, and not for Buyer's own operations or use.

             (e)    Buyer is not a party in interest with respect to any
employee benefit or other plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or of

Code and which is an investor in Seller.

             (f)    Other than Seller's Broker (as defined in Section 6.1
below), Buyer has had no contact with any broker or finder with respect to the
Property.

     Each of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this
Section shall be deemed remade by Buyer as of the Closing and shall survive the
Closing.

opportunity to inspect and investigate each and every aspect of the Property,
either independently or through agents of Buyer's choosing, including, without
limitation:

                    (1)     All matters relating to title and survey, together

1976 (42 U.S.C. Section 6901, et seq.), the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section

             (b)    Except as expressly stated herein, Seller makes no

                                        9
<Page>

Buyer, except as otherwise expressly stated herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing provisions, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (a)
any environmental or other report with respect to the Property which is
delivered by Seller to Buyer shall be for general informational purposes only,
(b) Buyer shall not have any right to rely on any such report delivered by
Seller to Buyer, but rather will rely on its own inspections and investigations
of the Property and any reports commissioned by Buyer with respect thereto, (c)
neither Seller, any affiliate of Seller nor the person or entity which prepared
any such report delivered by Seller to Buyer shall have any liability to Buyer
for any inaccuracy in or omission from any such report and (d) the failure to

including any proposal for work at the Property which was not performed by
Seller, shall not be actionable by Buyer under this Agreement or otherwise.

             (c)    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 3.1 ABOVE AND
ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
SELLER IS SELLING AND BUYER IS PURCHASING THE PROPERTY ON AN "AS IS WITH ALL
FAULTS" BASIS AND THAT BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, FROM SELLER, ANY SELLER RELATED
PARTIES, OR THEIR AGENTS OR BROKERS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ACTING OR PURPORTING TO
ACT ON BEHALF OF SELLER, AS TO ANY MATTERS CONCERNING THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING

     SECTION 3.7    RELEASE.

             (a)    Without limiting the above, and subject to the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in Section 3.1 hereof, Buyer
on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns waives its right to recover
from, and forever releases and discharges, Seller, Seller's

                                       10
<Page>

affiliates, Seller's investment advisor, the partners, trustees, beneficiaries,
shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees and agents and
representatives of each of them, and their respective heirs, successors,
personal representatives and assigns (collectively, the "SELLER RELATED
PARTIES"), from any and all demands, claims, legal or administrative
proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, penalties, fines, liens, judgments,
costs or expenses whatsoever (including, without limitation, court costs and
attorneys' fees and disbursements), whether direct or indirect, known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, that may arise on account of or in any way be
connected with (i) the physical condition of the Property including, without
limitation, all structural and seismic elements, all mechanical, electrical,
plumbing, sewage, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other systems, the
environmental condition of the Property and the presence of Hazardous Materials
on, under or about the Property, or (ii) any law or regulation applicable to the
Property, including, without limitation, any Environmental Law and any other
federal, state or local law.

     SECTION 3.8    SURVIVAL.

     The provisions of this Article III shall survive the Closing subject to the
limitations and qualifications contained in such provisions and in Sections 9.11
and 9.19 hereof.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                      TITLE

     SECTION 4.1    CONDITIONS OF TITLE.

             (a)    Upon execution of this Agreement, Seller shall order an
updated preliminary title report or commitment (the "TITLE REPORT") from
Heritage Title Company (the "TITLE COMPANY"), which shall be delivered to Buyer,
together with copies of all underlying documents relating to title exceptions
referred to therein, promptly upon Seller's receipt thereof. Seller shall also
furnish to Buyer within 2-days of the Effective Date the existing survey of the
Property in Seller's possession. Buyer shall immediately thereafter order any
plat or survey of the Property or any update thereto from a duly licensed
surveyor (the "SURVEY") if desired by Buyer or if necessary to support the
issuance of the Title Policy (as defined in Section 4.2 below). Buyer shall
provide to Seller a copy of the Survey, which shall be certified to the Title
Company, Buyer and Seller. Buyer shall pay the entire cost of the Survey for all
Survey work performed from and after the Effective Date. If Closing does not
occur, Buyer shall, if Seller so requests, assign to Seller all contract rights
Buyer has with the surveyor and in such event Seller shall reimburse Buyer for
the cost of the Survey.

             (b)    Within ten (10) business days prior to the last day of the
Contingency Period (the "TITLE REVIEW DATE"), or five (5) business days after
Buyer's receipt of the Title Report and Survey, which ever occurs first, Buyer
shall furnish Seller with a written statement of objections, if any, to the
title to the Property, including, without limitation, any objections to any
matter shown on the Survey (collectively, "OBJECTIONS"). In the event the Title
Company amends or updates the Title Report after the Title Review Date (each, a
"TITLE REPORT UPDATE"), Buyer shall furnish Seller with a written statement of
Objections to any matter first raised in a Title Report Update within three (3)
business days after its receipt of such Title Report Update

                                       11
<Page>

(each, a "TITLE UPDATE REVIEW PERIOD"). Should Buyer fail to notify Seller in
writing of any Objections in the Title Report prior to the Title Review Date,
or to any matter first disclosed in a Title Report Update prior to the Title
Update Review Period, as applicable, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved such
matters which shall be considered to be "CONDITIONS OF TITLE" as defined in
Section 4.1(e) below.

             (c)    If Seller receives a timely Objection in accordance with
Section 4.1(b) ("BUYER'S NOTICE"), Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, within five (5) business days after receipt of Buyer's Notice
("SELLER'S RESPONSE PERIOD"), to elect to attempt to cure any such matter upon
written notice to Buyer ("SELLER'S RESPONSE"), and may extend the Closing Date
for up to fifteen (15) business days to allow such cure. If Seller does not give
any Seller's Response, Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to attempt to
cure any such matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall in any event
be obligated to cure all matters or items (i) that are mortgage or deed of trust
liens or security interests against the Property, in each case granted by Seller
(and not tenants of the Property or other third parties), (ii) real estate tax
liens, other than liens for taxes and assessments not yet delinquent and (iii)
that have been voluntarily placed against the Property by Seller (and not
tenants of the Property or other third parties) after the date of this Agreement
and that are not otherwise permitted pursuant to the provisions hereof. Seller
shall be entitled to apply the Purchase Price towards the payment or
satisfaction of such liens, and may cure any Objection by causing the Title
Company to insure against collection of the same out of the Property.

             (d)    If Seller elects (or is deemed to have elected) not to
attempt to cure any Objections raised in any Buyer's Notice timely delivered by
Buyer to Seller pursuant to Section 4.1(b), or if Seller notifies Buyer that it
elects to attempt to cure any such Objection but then does not for any reason
effect such cure on or before the Closing Date as it may be extended hereunder,
then Buyer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, shall have the option of
terminating this Agreement by delivering written notice thereof to Seller within
three (3) business days after (as applicable) (i) its receipt of Seller's
Response stating that Seller will not attempt to cure any such Objection or (ii)
the expiration of Seller's Response Period if Seller does not deliver a Seller's
Response or (iii) Seller's failure to cure by the Closing Date (as it may be
extended hereunder) any Objection which Seller has previously elected to attempt
to cure pursuant to a Seller's Response. In the event of such a termination, the
Deposit shall immediately be returned to Buyer, and neither party shall have any
further rights or obligations hereunder except as provided in Sections 6.1, 9.3
and 9.9 below. If no such termination notice is timely received by Seller
hereunder, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all such Objections in which
event those Objections shall become "CONDITIONS OF TITLE" under Section 4.1 (e).
If the Closing is not consummated for any reason other than Seller's default
hereunder, Buyer shall be responsible for any title or escrow cancellation
charges.

             (e)    At the Closing, Seller shall convey title to the Property to
Buyer by deed in the form of EXHIBIT C attached hereto (the "DEED") subject to
no exceptions other than:

             (i)    Interests of tenants in possession under the Leases;

             (ii)   Matters created by, or with the written consent of, Buyer;

                                       12
<Page>

             (iii)  Non-delinquent liens for real estate taxes and assessments;
                    and

             (iv)   Any exceptions disclosed by the Title Report and any Title
                    Report Update which is approved or deemed approved by Buyer
                    in accordance with this Article IV above, and any exceptions
                    to title disclosed by the public records or which would be
                    disclosed by an inspection and/or survey of the Property.

     All of the foregoing exceptions shall be referred to collectively as the
"CONDITIONS OF TITLE." Subject to the terms and conditions contained elsewhere
in this Agreement, by acceptance of the Deed and the Closing of the purchase and
sale of the Property, (x) Buyer agrees it is assuming for the benefit of Seller
all of the obligations of Seller with respect to the Conditions of Title from
and after the Closing, and (y) Buyer agrees that Seller shall have conclusively
satisfied its obligations with respect to title to the Property. The provisions
of this Section shall survive the Closing.

     SECTION 4.2    EVIDENCE OF TITLE.

     Delivery of title in accordance with the foregoing shall be evidenced by
the willingness of the Title Company to issue, at Closing, its Owner's ALTA
Policy of Title Insurance in the amount of the Purchase Price showing title to
the Real Property vested in Buyer, subject to the Conditions of Title (the
"TITLE POLICY"). The Title Policy may contain such endorsements as reasonably
required by Buyer provided that the issuance of such endorsements shall not be a
condition to Buyer's obligations hereunder. Buyer shall pay the costs for all
such endorsements, including, without limitation, all costs for so-called
"extended coverage" and/or a survey deletion endorsement and Seller shall pay
for the issuance of the TLTA Policy of Title Insurance in favor of Buyer. Seller
shall have no obligation to provide any indemnity or agreement to the Title
Company or Buyer to support the issuance of the Title Policy or any such
endorsements other than an affidavit as to the existing tenants of the Property
and any ongoing construction work at the Property and a GAP undertaking.

                                    ARTICLE V

                       RISK OF LOSS AND INSURANCE PROCEEDS

     SECTION 5.1    MINOR LOSS.

     Buyer shall be bound to purchase the Property for the full Purchase price
as required by the terms hereof, without regard to the occurrence or effect of
any damage to the Property or destruction of any improvements thereon or
condemnation of any portion of the Property, provided that: (a) the cost to
repair any such damage or destruction does not exceed Four Million Dollars
($4,000,000) in the estimate of an architect or contractor selected by Seller
and reasonably acceptable to Buyer or in the case of a condemnation, the
diminution in the value of the remaining Property as a result of a partial
condemnation is not material (as hereinafter defined) and (b) upon the Closing,
there shall be a credit against the Purchase Price due hereunder equal to the
amount of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards collected by Seller as a
result of any such damage or destruction or condemnation, plus the amount of any

                                       13
<Page>

insurance deductible, less any sums expended by Seller toward the collection of
such proceeds or awards and the restoration or repair of the Property (the
nature of which restoration or repairs, but not the right of Seller to effect
such restoration or repairs, shall be subject to the approval of Buyer, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the
proceeds or awards have not been collected as of the Closing, then such proceeds
or awards shall be assigned to Buyer, except to the extent needed to reimburse
Seller for sums expended to collect such proceeds or awards or to repair or
restore the Property, and Seller shall retain the rights to such proceeds and
awards to such extent.

     SECTION 5.2    MAJOR LOSS.

     If the cost to repair the damage or destruction as specified above exceeds
Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) in the estimate of an architect or contractor
selected by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer or the diminution in the
value of the remaining Property as a result of a condemnation is material (as
hereinafter defined), then Buyer may, at its option to be exercised within five
(5) days of Seller's notice of the occurrence of the damage or destruction or
the commencement of condemnation proceedings, either terminate this Agreement or
consummate the purchase for the full Purchase Price as required by the terms
hereof. If Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice
thereof to Seller or fails to give Seller notice within such five (5) day period
that Buyer will proceed with the purchase, then this Agreement shall terminate,
the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer and neither party shall have any further
rights or obligations hereunder except as provided in Sections 6.1, 9.3 and 9.9
below. If Buyer elects to proceed with the purchase, then upon the Closing,
there shall be a credit against the Purchase Price due hereunder equal to the
amount of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards collected by Seller as a
result of any such damage or destruction or condemnation, plus the amount of any
insurance deductible, less any sums expended by Seller toward the collection of
such proceeds or awards or to restoration or repair of the Property (the nature
of which restoration or repairs, but not the right of Seller to effect such
restoration or repairs, shall be subject to the approval of Buyer, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the
proceeds or awards have not been collected as of the Closing, then such proceeds
or awards shall be assigned to Buyer, except to the extent needed to reimburse
Seller for sums expended to collect such proceeds or awards or to repair or
restore the Property, and Seller shall retain the rights to such proceeds and
awards to such extent. A condemnation shall be deemed material if any portion of
any net rentable area of the Improvements, or any parking is taken which would
cause the Property to be in violation of any existing laws or regulations,
including but not limited to, zoning regulations, or the existing access to the
Property is materially and adversely affected, permanently.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              BROKERS AND EXPENSES

     SECTION 6.1    BROKERS.

     The parties represent and warrant to each other that no broker or finder
was instrumental in arranging or bringing about this transaction except for
Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, L.P. ("SELLER'S BROKER"). At Closing, Seller shall pay
the commission due, if any, to Seller's Broker,

                                       14
<Page>

which shall be paid pursuant to a separate agreement between Seller and Seller's
Broker. If any other person brings a claim for a commission or finder's fee
based upon any contact, dealings or communication with Buyer or Seller, then the
party through whom such person makes his claim shall defend the other party (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from such claim, and shall indemnify the Indemnified Party
and hold the Indemnified Party harmless from any and all costs, damages, claims,
liabilities or expenses (including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by the Indemnified Party
in defending against the claim. The provisions of this Section 6.1 shall survive
the Closing or, if the purchase and sale is not consummated, any termination of
this Agreement.

     SECTION 6.2    EXPENSES.

     Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, each party hereto shall pay
its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                           LEASES AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

     SECTION 7.1    BUYER'S APPROVAL OF NEW LEASES AND AGREEMENTS AFFECTING THE
PROPERTY.

     Between the Effective Date and the Closing, Seller shall continue to lease
the Property in the same manner as before the making of this Agreement, the same
as though Seller were retaining the Property provided that after the expiration
of the Contingency Period Seller shall not enter into any new Lease or other
agreement affecting the Property, or modify or terminate any existing Lease or
other agreement affecting the Property, which will be binding on the Property
after Closing, except as permitted or required under any Lease and except for
agreements which are terminable on no more than sixty (60) days' notice without
payment of any penalty or fee or other cost to Seller, without first obtaining
Buyer's approval of the proposed action, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. In such case, Buyer shall specify in detail
the reasons for its disapproval of any such proposed action. If Buyer fails to
give Seller notice of its approval or disapproval of any such proposed action
requiring its approval under this Section 7.1 within three (3) business days
after Seller notifies Buyer in writing of Seller's desire to take such action,
then Buyer shall be deemed to have given its approval. Any new Lease or other
agreement or amendment shall be on Seller's standard forms for such documents.
Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in enabling Seller to complete any such
proposed transaction requiring Buyer's approval.

     SECTION 7.2    TENANT IMPROVEMENT COSTS, LEASING COMMISSIONS AND
CONCESSIONS.

     With respect to any new Lease or Lease modification entered into by Seller
after April 12, 2004 and the Closing Date, and with respect to any renewal or
extension of any Lease, whether through the exercise of an option or otherwise,
occurring between such date and the Closing Date, all tenant improvement work,
leasing commissions, legal fees, or other expenses or grants of any free rent
period or other concessions shall be prorated over the term of the lease,
renewal or extension, based on the economic benefit to the parties hereto
occurring before or

                                       15
<Page>

after the Closing (with respect to any new Lease or Lease modification entered
into by Seller after April 12, 2004 for which Buyer has not given its approval
or been deemed to have given its approval pursuant to Section 7.1 above,
expenses subject to proration shall be subject to the following caps; all tenant
improvement work at $10.00 per square foot, leasing commissions at $3.00 per
square foot and legal fees at $1,500.00 per transaction). Seller's share of such
costs shall be based on the portion of economic benefit of the lease term,
renewal or extension, as the case may be, occurring prior to Closing, which
amount shall be a credit against the Purchase Price, and Buyer shall be
responsible for the remainder of such costs. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for
all such costs incurred by Seller to the extent Buyer is obligated therefor
pursuant to the provisions hereof. Pursuant to the Assignment of Leases Buyer
shall assume any then outstanding obligations with respect to such tenant
improvements, leasing commissions and concessions for any Lease signed after
April 12, 2004; Seller hereby agreeing to be responsible for payment of tenant
improvement allowances, leasing commissions and concessions due and owing for
any Lease signed on and prior to April 12, 2004. The provisions of this Section
shall survive the Closing.

     SECTION 7.3    TENANT NOTICES.

     At the Closing, Seller shall furnish Buyer with a signed notice to be given
to each tenant of the Property. The notice shall disclose that the Property has
been sold to Buyer, that, after the Closing, all rents should be paid to Buyer
and that Buyer shall be responsible for all of the tenant's security deposit.
The form of the notice shall be otherwise reasonably acceptable to the parties.
Buyer covenants to deliver said notices to each tenant as soon as reasonably
possible after Closing. This provision shall expressly survive Closing.

     SECTION 7.4    MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS AND OPERATION OF PROPERTY;
REMOVAL OF TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY.

     Seller agrees to keep its customary property insurance covering the
Property in effect until the Closing (provided, however, that the terms of any
such coverage maintained in blanket form may be modified as Seller deems
necessary). Seller shall maintain all Improvements substantially in their
present condition (ordinary wear and tear, casualty and condemnation excepted),
and shall operate and manage the Property in a manner consistent with Seller's
practices in effect prior to the Effective Date, provided that Seller shall in
no event be obligated to make any capital expenditures or repairs. Seller shall
not remove any Tangible Personal Property, except as may be required for
necessary repair or replacement, and replacement shall be of approximately equal
quality and quantity as the removed item of Tangible Personal Property.

     SECTION 7.5    SERVICE CONTRACTS.

     Within three (3) business days prior to the expiration of the Contingency
Period, Buyer will advise Seller in writing which Service Contracts Buyer will
assume and which Service Contracts Buyer requests be terminated at Closing (and
Buyer's failure to so advise Seller in writing shall be deemed to constitute
Buyer's election to assume all such Service Contracts), provided Seller shall
have no obligation to terminate, and Buyer shall be obligated to assume, any
Service Contracts which by their terms cannot be terminated without penalty or
payment of a

                                       16
<Page>

fee or other cost to Seller. Seller shall deliver at Closing notices of
termination of all Service Contracts that are not so assumed and Buyer shall be
responsible for any charges applicable to periods commencing with the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall terminate, as of the Closing Date,
all existing management and leasing agreements with respect to the Property.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                               CLOSING AND ESCROW

     SECTION 8.1    ESCROW INSTRUCTIONS.

     Upon execution of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall deposit an
executed counterpart of this Agreement with Escrowee (in regard to
administration of the Deposit) and also with the Title Company, and this
instrument shall serve as the instructions to the Escrowee as the escrow holder,
and the Title Company for consummation of the purchase and sale contemplated
hereby. Seller and Buyer agree to execute such reasonable additional and
supplementary escrow instructions as may be appropriate to enable Escrowee and
the Title Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,
that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and
any supplementary escrow instructions, the terms of this Agreement shall
control.

     SECTION 8.2    CLOSING.

     The Closing hereunder shall be held and delivery of all items to be made at
the Closing under the terms of this Agreement shall be made on June 7, 2004, and
before 11:00 a.m. local time, or such other earlier date and time as Buyer and
Seller may mutually agree upon in writing (the "CLOSING DATE"). The Closing
shall be held at the offices of the Title Company or as otherwise mutually
agreed on by the parties. Except as expressly provided herein, such date and
time may not be extended without the prior written approval of both Seller and
Buyer. In no event shall Buyer be required to close this transaction between
June 8, 2004 and June 19, 2004.

     SECTION 8.3    DEPOSIT OF DOCUMENTS.

             (a)    At or before the Closing, Seller shall deposit into escrow
the following items:

                    (1)     the duly executed and acknowledged Deed in the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT C conveying the Real Property to Buyer subject to the
Conditions of Title;

                    (2)     four (4) duly executed counterparts of the Bill of
Sale in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT D (the "BILL OF SALE");

                    (3)     four (4) duly executed counterparts of an Assignment
and Assumption of Leases, Service Contracts, Warranties and Other Intangible
Property in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT E pursuant to the terms of which
Buyer shall assume all of Seller's obligations under the Leases, Service
Contracts, and other documents and agreements affecting the Property (the
"ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES");

                                       17
<Page>

                    (4)     an affidavit pursuant to Section 1445(b)(2) of the
Code, and on which Buyer is entitled to rely, that Seller is not a "foreign
person" within the meaning of Section 1445(f)(3) of the Code; and

             (b)    At or before Closing, Buyer shall deposit into escrow the
following items:

                    (1)     immediately available funds necessary to close this
transaction, including, without limitation, the Purchase Price (less the Deposit
and interest thereon net of investment fees, if any) and funds sufficient to pay
Buyer's closing costs and share of prorations hereunder;

                    (2)     four (4) duly executed counterparts of the Bill of
Sale; and

                    (3)     four (4) duly executed counterparts of the
Assignment of Leases.

             (c)    Seller and Buyer shall each execute and deposit a closing
statement, such transfer tax declarations and such other instruments as are
reasonably required by the Title Company or otherwise required to close the
escrow and consummate the acquisition of the Property in accordance with the
terms hereof. Seller and Buyer hereby designate Title Company as the "REPORTING
PERSON" for the transaction pursuant to Section 6045(e) of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and agree to execute such documentation as is
reasonably necessary to effectuate such designation.

             (d)    Within five (5) business days after the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver or make available at the Property to Buyer: originals of the
Leases to the extent in Seller's possession, or copies of any Leases not in
Seller's possession together with an affidavit from Seller as to such copies
being true and complete copies of the applicable Lease(s), copies of the tenant
correspondence files (for the three (3) most recent years of Seller's ownership
of the Property only and the current year), and originals of any other items
which Seller was required to furnish Buyer copies of or make available at the
Property pursuant to Sections 2.1(b) or (e) above, to the extent in Seller's
possession, except for Seller's general ledger and other internal books or
records which shall be retained by Seller. Seller shall deliver possession of
the Property to Buyer as required hereunder and shall deliver to Buyer or make
available at the Property a set of keys to the Property on the Closing Date.

     SECTION 8.4    ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES.

             (a)    If in accordance with Article II of this Agreement Buyer
elects to proceed with the purchase of the Property, then Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain estoppel certificates from each tenant
of the Property substantially in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT F or, if a
tenant's lease requires a different form, in the form required by the tenant's
lease, or as otherwise provided in this paragraph below. It shall be a condition
to Buyer's obligation to close the sale and purchase of the Property that on or
before the Closing, Buyer is able to obtain an estoppel certificate
substantially in such form from tenants occupying at least eighty-five percent
(85%) of the area of the Property actually rented to tenants (collectively, the
"ESTOPPEL THRESHOLD"). All estoppel certificates shall be dated no earlier than
the Effective Date. An estoppel certificate, even though not in the required
estoppel form, will be deemed reasonably acceptable to Buyer if it (i) contains
the following information: confirming rent,

                                       18
<Page>

reimbursements, security deposit, and termination date; that no rent has been
paid more than one month in advance; that the Lease is in full force and effect
and that a true and correct copy of the Lease with all amendments and
modifications is attached; and that all work to be performed by landlord has
been performed and that the tenant has no knowledge of any landlord default, and
that all tenant improvement allowances (if any) have been paid, (ii) is on the
form required by the Lease, or (iii) is on the standard form of a tenant which
customarily issues its own form. Whether or not Seller is able to satisfy the
Estoppel Threshold, Seller shall deliver estoppel certificates to Buyer
containing the information set forth in clause (i) above executed by Seller
covering such leases as are sufficient, when aggregated with the tenant estoppel
certificates previously delivered, to satisfy 100% tenant estoppel delivery,
provided that Buyer shall not be obligated to accept Seller estoppel
certificates that collectively cover in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the
area of the Property actually rented to tenants. Seller's representations and
warranties in any Seller estoppel certificates will survive the Closing, subject
to the limitations contained in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 9.11 and 9.19 hereof. In
the event that Buyer receives an estoppel certificate from a tenant complying
with the requirements of this Section 8.4 and for which Seller previously
delivered its estoppel certificate, Seller shall be automatically released from
any liability or obligation under its estoppel certificate.

             (b)    If Seller is unable to obtain and deliver sufficient tenant
estoppel certificates as required under Section 8.4(a), or if the certificates
received or substituted Seller estoppels contain material information or
omissions unacceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion and Buyer objects
thereto by written notice to Seller within two (2) business days after receipt
by Buyer of the objectionable estoppel, but in any event on or before the
Closing Date, then Seller will not be in default by reason thereof, and Seller
may elect to extend the Closing Date by up to thirty (30) days in order to
satisfy the requirement. If Seller still cannot satisfy the requirement at the
end of such extended period, then Buyer may, by written notice given to Seller
before the Closing, elect to terminate this Agreement and receive an immediate
refund of the Deposit or waive said condition. If Buyer so elects to terminate
this Agreement, neither party shall have any further rights or obligations
hereunder except as provided in Section 6.1 above and Sections 9.3 and 9.9
below. If no such notice is delivered by Buyer, Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived such condition.

     SECTION 8.5    PRORATIONS.

             (a)    Rents, including, without limitation, percentage rents, if
any, and any additional charges and expenses payable by tenants under Leases,
all as and when actually collected (excepting therefrom rents and reimbursements
for month in which Closing occurs which shall be credited to Buyer at Closing
for the period beginning on the Closing Date through the end of the month in
which Closing occurs); real property taxes and assessments; water, sewer and
utility charges; amounts payable under any Service Contracts or other agreements
or documents; annual permits and/or inspection fees (calculated on the basis of
the period covered); and any other expenses of the operation and maintenance of
the Property (including, without limitation, expenses prepaid by Seller and
expenses already paid by Seller but which are being amortized over time by
Seller and with respect to which Seller shall receive a credit at Closing in the
amount of the prepaid or unamortized portion thereof), shall all be prorated as
of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately prior to Closing (i.e., Buyer is entitled
to the income and responsible for the expenses of the day of Closing), on the
basis of a 365-day year. Buyer shall reimburse Seller

                                       19
<Page>

for the tenant improvement costs, leasing commissions, legal fees and other
expenses, and free rent and other concessions, as provided in Section 7.2.

     All rents collected after the Closing shall be applied and paid as provided
in this Section 8.5(a). If a tenant shall specifically designate a payment as
being attributable to, or if it is readily ascertainable that a payment received
from a tenant is attributable to a specific period of time or for a specific
purpose, including, without limitation, for operating expenses or real estate
tax payments which were not paid or were underpaid by such tenant or for
reimbursement for work performed by Seller on the tenant's premises, such
payment shall be so applied. If there is no such designation or if not so
readily ascertainable, any payment received from a tenant after Closing shall be
deemed a payment of rent due after the Closing until the tenant is current on
rents and sums due under the applicable Lease on or after the Closing, and then
such payments shall be paid to Seller to the extent of any rent or other sums
owing to Seller for periods prior to Closing and for periods after Closing for
which Buyer received a credit at closing. Seller shall not receive a credit at
Closing for any past due rent, or reimbursements, or other charges due and owing
to Seller from any tenant. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to collect such
rents and other sums owing to Seller. Seller retains the right to collect any
such rents and other sums from tenants after Closing; provided, however, that
Seller shall have no right to cause any such tenant to be evicted or to exercise
any other landlord remedy against such tenant other than to sue for collection.

     Reconciliations of taxes, insurance charges and other expenses owed by
tenants under Leases for the calendar year (or fiscal year if different from the
calendar year) in which the Closing occurs shall be prepared by Buyer with the
cooperation of Seller within 90 days following the end of such year in
accordance with the requirements set forth in the Leases and as provided in this
Section 8.5(a). For those Leases in which tenants pay a proportionate share of
taxes, insurance charges or other expenses over a base year amount or expense
stop, the proration between the parties of the income received from tenants over
such base year amount or expense stop shall be calculated based on the total
amount of such expenses for the Property incurred by both Seller and Buyer for
the entire calendar (or, if applicable, fiscal) year, rather than on the amount
of such expenses actually incurred by each party for such year, in order to
enable the parties to determine if the base year amount or expense stop for such
year is exceeded. Such income as so calculated shall be prorated between the
parties based on the number of days each party owned the Property during such
year and otherwise in accordance with this Section 8.5(a). By way of
illustration but without limiting the foregoing, if: (i) the Closing occurs on
June 1, 2002, (ii) during Seller's period of ownership of the Property during
the year 2002 (151 days), Seller incurred expenses of $450,000, (iii) during
Buyer's period of ownership of the Property during the year 2002 (214 days),
Buyer incurred expenses of $500,000, (iv) total expenses for such year recovered
from tenants under Leases is $400,000 (e.g., $950,000 total expenses minus a
total base year amount of $550,000), then Seller would be entitled to
$165,479.45 of such income ($400,000/365 days = $1,095.89 per diem multiplied by
151 days) and Buyer would be entitled to $234,520.55 of such income ($1,095.89
per diem multiplied by 214 days), regardless of the actual amount of expenses
actually incurred by each party (which would have instead resulted in Seller
receiving $189,473.68 of such income and Buyer receiving $210,526.32 of such
income). For Leases which do not have a base year amount or expense stop, the
proration between the parties of income received from tenants from
reconciliations of expenses under the Leases shall be calculated based on the
expenses actually incurred by each

                                       20
<Page>

party for such year and each party's period of ownership of the Property, and
otherwise in accordance with this Section 8.5(a).

     The amount of any cash security deposits held by Seller under Leases, as
shown on Exhibit B, shall be credited against the Purchase Price (and Seller
shall be entitled to retain such cash security deposits). Seller shall receive
credits at Closing for the amount of any utility or other deposits with respect
to the Property. Buyer shall cause all utilities to be transferred into Buyer's
name and account at the time of Closing.

     Seller and Buyer hereby agree that if any of the aforesaid prorations and
credits cannot be calculated accurately on the Closing Date or in the case of
rents or other charges received from tenants, such amount have not been
collected, then the same shall be calculated as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date or the date such amounts have been collected, and either
party owing the other party a sum of money based on such subsequent proration(s)
or credits shall pay said sum to the other party within thirty (30) days
thereafter. Any amounts not paid within such thirty (30) day period shall bear
interest from the date actually received by the payor until paid at the greater
of (i) the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum or (ii) the prime rate (or base
rate) reported from time to time in the "Money Rates" column or section of THE
WALL STREET JOURNAL as being the base rate on corporate loans at larger United
States money center commercial banks plus two (2) percent. Upon request of
either party, the parties shall provide a detailed and accurate written
statement signed by such party certifying as to the payments received by such
party from tenants from and after Closing and to the manner in which such
payments were applied, and shall make their books and records available for
inspection by the other party during ordinary business hours upon reasonable
advance notice.

             (b)    All title charges for endorsements, including, without
limitation, all charges for so-called "extended coverage" and/or a survey
deletion endorsement and reinsurance charges (if any), survey costs, escrow or
closing fees, sale and transfer taxes, recording fees or taxes, documentary
taxes and similar taxes and fees imposed upon the transfer of the Property by
applicable law shall be paid by Buyer at Closing. Seller shall pay for the
issuance of the TLTA Policy of Title Insurance in favor of Buyer at Closing. Any
escrow fees shall be split equally between Seller and Buyer. The parties will
execute and deliver any required transfer or other similar tax declarations to
the appropriate governmental entity at Closing.

             (c)    Any percentage rent for the rental periods including Closing
shall be prorated upon receipt, based upon the tenant's sales for the portion of
the lease year allocable to Seller's and Buyer's respective ownership of the
Property. Buyer shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of all percentage rent
statements or notices received by Buyer from tenants of the Property and shall,
within fifteen (15) days of receipt of payments of percentage rent from tenants,
deliver to Seller the portion of such percentage rent which is allocated to
Seller hereunder. Funds not paid within such fifteen (15) day period shall bear
interest at the rate provided in Section 8.5(a) above.

             (d)    The provisions of this Section 8.5 shall survive the
Closing.

     SECTION 9.2    ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

     This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and schedules hereto, contains
all representations, warranties and covenants made by Buyer and Seller and
constitutes the entire understanding between the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof. Any prior correspondence, memoranda or agreements are
replaced in total by this Agreement together with the Exhibits and schedules
hereto.

     SECTION 9.3    ENTRY AND INDEMNITY.

     In connection with any entry by Buyer, or its agents, employees or
contractors onto the Property, Buyer shall give Seller reasonable advance notice
of such entry and shall conduct such entry and any inspections in connection
therewith (a) during normal business hours, (b) so as to minimize, to the
greatest extent possible, interference with Seller's business and the business
of Seller's tenants, (c) in compliance with all applicable laws, and (d)
otherwise in a manner reasonably acceptable to Seller. Without limiting the
foregoing, prior to any entry to perform any on-site testing, including but not
limited to any borings, drillings or samplings, Buyer shall give Seller written
notice thereof, including the identity of the company or persons who will
perform such testing and the proposed scope and methodology of the testing.
Seller shall approve or disapprove, in Seller's sole discretion, the proposed
testing within three (3) business days after receipt of such notice. If Seller
fails to respond within such three (3) business day period, Seller shall be
deemed to have disapproved the proposed testing. If Buyer or its agents,
employees or contractors take any sample from the Property in connection with
any such approved testing, Buyer shall provide to Seller a portion of such
sample being tested to allow Seller, if it so chooses, to perform its own
testing. Buyer shall permit Seller or its representative to be present to
observe any testing or other inspection or due diligence review performed on or
at the Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Buyer shall not contact any governmental authority or any tenant without first
obtaining the prior written consent of Seller thereto in Seller's sole
discretion, and Seller, at Seller's election, shall be entitled to have a
representative participate in any telephone or other contact made by Buyer to a
governmental authority or tenant and present at any meeting by Buyer with a
governmental authority or tenant. Buyer shall maintain, and shall assure that
its contractors maintain, public liability and property damage insurance in
amounts and in form and substance adequate to insure against all liability of
Buyer and its agents, employees or contractors, arising out of any entry or
inspections of the Property pursuant to the provisions hereof, and Buyer shall
provide Seller with evidence of such insurance coverage upon request by Seller.
Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any costs,
damages, liabilities, losses, expenses, liens or claims (including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements)
arising out of or relating to any entry on the Property by Buyer, its agents,
employees or contractors in the course of performing the inspections, testings
or inquiries provided for in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
release of Hazardous Materials or any damage to

                                       23
<Page>

the Property; provided that Buyer shall not be liable to Seller solely as a
result of the discovery by Buyer of a pre-existing condition on the Property to
the extent the activities of Buyer, its agents, representatives, employees,
contractors or consultants do not exacerbate the condition. The provisions of
this Section 9.3 shall be in addition to any access or indemnity agreement
previously executed by Buyer in connection with the Property; provided that in
the event of any inconsistency between this Section 9.3 and such other
agreement, the provisions of this Section 9.3 shall govern. The foregoing
indemnity shall survive beyond the Closing, or, if the sale is not consummated,
beyond the termination of this Agreement. Buyer's right of entry, as provided in
this Section 9.3, shall continue up through the date of Closing.

     SECTION 9.4    TIME.

     Time is of the essence in the performance of each of the parties'
respective obligations contained herein. If the time period by which any right,
option or election provided under this Agreement must be exercised, or by which
any act required hereunder must be performed, or by which the Closing must be
held, expires on a Saturday, Sunday or legal or bank holiday, then such time
period shall be automatically extended through the close of business on the next
regularly scheduled business day.

     SECTION 9.5    ATTORNEYS' FEES.

     If either party hereto fails to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement or if any dispute arises between the parties hereto concerning the
meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement, whether prior to
or after Closing, or if any party defaults in payment of its post-Closing
financial obligations under this Agreement, then the defaulting party or the
party not prevailing in such dispute, as the case may be, shall pay any and all
costs and expenses incurred by the other party on account of such default and/or
in enforcing or establishing its rights hereunder, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements.

     SECTION 9.6    ASSIGNMENT.

     Buyer's rights and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable without
the prior written consent of Seller in Seller's sole discretion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer shall have the right, without the necessity of obtaining
Seller's consent but with prior written notice to Seller, to assign its right,
title and interest in and to this Agreement to a separate account, or an entity
owned by a separate account, of Buyer at any time before the Closing Date. Buyer
shall in no event be released from any of its obligations or liabilities
hereunder in connection with any assignment. Without limiting and
notwithstanding the above, in no event shall Buyer have the right to assign its
rights or obligations hereunder to any party which could not make the
representation and warranty contained in subsection 3.5(e) above, and in
connection with any assignment pursuant to the terms hereof, the assignee shall
reconfirm in a written instrument acceptable to Seller and delivered to Seller
prior to the effective date of the assignment said representation and warranty
as applied to the assignee and that all other terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall apply to such assignee. Subject to the provisions of this
Section, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

     SECTION 9.7    COUNTERPARTS.

     This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

     SECTION 9.8    GOVERNING LAW.

     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State in which the Real Property is located.

     SECTION 9.9    CONFIDENTIALITY AND RETURN OF DOCUMENTS.

     Buyer and Seller shall each maintain as confidential any and all material
obtained about the other or, in the case of Buyer, about the Property, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not disclose such
information to any third party. Except as may be required by law, Buyer will not
divulge any such information to other persons or entities including, without
limitation, appraisers, real estate brokers, or competitors of Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the right to disclose
information with respect to the Property to its officers, directors, employees,
attorneys, accountants, environmental auditors, engineers, potential lenders,
and permitted assignees under this Agreement and other consultants to the extent
necessary for Buyer to evaluate its acquisition of the Property provided that
all such persons are told that such information is confidential and agree (in
writing for any third party engineers, environmental auditors or other
consultants) to keep such information confidential. If Buyer acquires the
Property from Seller, Seller shall have the right, subsequent to the Closing of
such acquisition, to publicize the transaction (other than the parties to or the
specific economics of the transaction) in whatever manner it deems appropriate;
provided that any press release or other public disclosure regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, and the wording of same, must
be approved in advance by both parties. Nothing contained herein shall prevent
Seller from making any disclosure(s) required by applicable law. The provisions
of this paragraph shall survive the Closing or any termination of this
Agreement. In the event the transaction contemplated by this Agreement does not
close as provided herein, upon the request of Seller, Buyer shall promptly
return to Seller all Due Diligence Materials and other documents and copies
obtained by Buyer in connection with the purchase of the Property hereunder.

     SECTION 9.10   INTERPRETATION OF AGREEMENT.

     The article, section and other headings of this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be construed to affect the meaning
of any provision contained herein. Where the context so requires, the use of the
singular shall include the plural and vice versa and the use of the masculine
shall include the feminine and the neuter. The term "PERSON" shall include any
individual, partnership, joint venture, corporation, trust, unincorporated
association, any other entity and any government or any department or agency
thereof, whether acting in an individual, fiduciary or other capacity.

                                       25

     SECTION 9.11   LIMITED LIABILITY.

     The obligations of Seller under this Agreement and under all of the Other
Documents are intended to be binding only on the property of Seller and shall
not be personally binding upon, nor shall any resort be had to, the private
properties of any Seller Related Parties.

     SECTION 9.12   AMENDMENTS.

     This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument
signed by Buyer and Seller.

     SECTION 9.13   NO RECORDING.

     Neither this Agreement or any memorandum or short form thereof may be
recorded by Buyer.

     SECTION 9.14   DRAFTS NOT AN OFFER TO ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING
CONTRACT.

     The parties hereto agree that the submission of a draft of this Agreement
by one party to another is not intended by either party to be an offer to enter
into a legally binding contract with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Property. The parties shall be legally bound with respect to the purchase and
sale of the Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement only if and when
the parties have been able to negotiate all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in a manner acceptable to each of the parties in their respective sole
discretion, and both Seller and Buyer have fully executed and delivered to each
other a counterpart of this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.15   ERISA.

     Without limiting Buyer's representation and warranty in Section 3.5(e)
above, within ten (10) days after the Effective Date, Buyer shall furnish to
Seller all information regarding Buyer, its affiliates and the shareholders,
members, investors or partners of each of them and any permitted assignees of
Buyer hereunder (collectively, the "BUYER RELATED PARTIES") as Seller requests
in order to enable Seller to determine to Seller's sole satisfaction that
Buyer's representation and warranty contained in Section 3.5(e) of this
Agreement is true and correct. Buyer represents and warrants and covenants to
Seller that there will not be any change in any such information regarding Buyer
or the Buyer Related Parties prior to or on the Closing. In the event any such
information or change in Seller's reasonable judgment makes this transaction a
sale to a party-in-interest, Seller may terminate this Agreement without
liability on the part of Seller or Buyer (provided such change did not occur as
a result of a default by Buyer), other than Buyer's indemnity contained in
Section 9.3 hereof and the obligations of Buyer contained in Sections 6.1 and
9.9 hereof, and the Deposit will be returned to Buyer.

     SECTION 9.16   NO PARTNERSHIP.

     The relationship of the parties hereto is solely that of Seller and Buyer
with respect to the Property and no joint venture or other partnership exists
between the parties hereto. Neither party has any fiduciary relationship
hereunder to the other.

                                       26

     SECTION 9.17   NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY.

     The provisions of this Agreement are not intended to benefit any third
     parties.

     SECTION 9.18   INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

     SECTION 9.19   LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, after the
Closing: (a) the maximum aggregate liability of Seller, and the maximum
aggregate amount which may be awarded to and collected by Buyer (including,
without limitation, for any breach of any representation, warranty and/or
covenant by Seller) under this Agreement or any documents executed pursuant
hereto or in connection herewith, including, without limitation, the Deed, the
Bill of Sale, the Assignment of Leases and any Seller estoppel certificate
(collectively, the "OTHER DOCUMENTS"), shall under no circumstances whatsoever
exceed One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000); and (b) no claim
by Buyer alleging a breach by Seller of any representation, warranty and/or
covenant of Seller contained herein or in any of the Other Documents may be
made, and Seller shall not be liable for any judgment in any action based upon
any such claim, unless and until such claim, either alone or together with any
other claims by Buyer alleging a breach by Seller of any such representation,
warranty and/or covenant is for an aggregate amount in excess of Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000) (the "FLOOR AMOUNT"), in which event Seller's
liability respecting any final judgment concerning such claim or claims shall be
for the entire amount thereof, subject to the limitation set forth in clause (a)
above; provided, however, that if any such final judgment is for an amount that
is less than or equal to the Floor Amount, then Seller shall have no liability
with respect thereto.

     SECTION 9.20   SURVIVAL.

     Except as expressly set forth to the contrary herein, no representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller contained herein shall survive the
Closing.

     SECTION 9.21   SEVERABILITY.

     If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance shall for any reason and to any extent be held to be
invalid or unenforceable, then such term or provision shall be ignored, and to
the maximum extent possible, this Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect, but without giving effect to such term or provision.

     SECTION 9.22   NO WAIVER.

     Neither the failure of either party to exercise any power given such party
hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by the other party with its
obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the parties at variance
with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver of either party's right to
demand exact compliance with the terms hereof.

                                       27
<Page>

     SECTION 9.23   CONSTRUCTION.

     The parties agree that this Agreement is the result of negotiation by the
parties, each of whom was represented by counsel, and thus, this Agreement shall
not be construed against the maker thereof.

     SECTION 9.24   SURVIVAL OF ARTICLE IX.

     The provisions of this Article IX shall survive the Closing.

                                       28

or effective, and neither Assignor nor any Seller Related Parties (as defined in
the Agreement) shall have any liability with respect thereto.

     The obligations of Assignor are intended to be binding only on the property

had to, the private properties of any Seller Related Parties.

     All of the covenants, terms and conditions set forth herein shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
