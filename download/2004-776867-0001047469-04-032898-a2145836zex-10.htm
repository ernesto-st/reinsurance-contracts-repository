right to require the marshalling of assets of either of the Borrowers or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the obligations, and all suretyship
defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the Demand Requirement, each of the Guarantors agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing or otherwise
executed in connection with any obligation and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that its obligations in respect of its Guaranty shall not be released or discharged, in whole

entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the obligations; (ii)&nbsp;any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any obligation;
(iii)&nbsp;any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the obligations or any rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications of
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the obligations, (iv)&nbsp;the
addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any obligation; (v)&nbsp;the adequacy of any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Lender
may have against any means of obtaining repayment of any of the obligations; or (vi)&nbsp;any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of either of the
Guarantors or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of either of the Guarantors, all of which may be done without notice to either of the Guarantors. Subject to the Demand Requirement, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Guarantors hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A)&nbsp;any "one action" or "anti-deficiency" law
which would otherwise prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of
set-off), against either of the Guarantors before or after the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, </FONT></P>

of the Borrowers on any Business Day during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Issuing Lender; </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the Issuing Lender shall not

two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or
date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Lender:
(A)&nbsp;the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B)&nbsp;the amount thereof; (C)&nbsp;the expiry date thereof; (D)&nbsp;the name and

beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G)&nbsp;such other matters as the Issuing Lender may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of

(which shall be a Business Day); (C)&nbsp;the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D)&nbsp;such other matters as the Issuing Lender may reasonably require. Additionally, the relevant Borrower

notice from any Lender or the Administrative Agent, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable
conditions contained in Section&nbsp;5 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for
the account of the relevant Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the Issuing Lender's usual and customary business practices.
