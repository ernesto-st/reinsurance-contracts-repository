The cash incentive award, if any, shall be determined by, and in the sole and absolute  discretion of, the Compensation Committee of the Board (or if no such committee is in place, the Board) in  consultation with the CEO. The Compensation Committee of the Board (or if no such committee, the Board)  in consultation with the CEO, shall determine the amount (if any) and terms of any cash incentive award  (including any applicable performance criteria and/or deferral component). The determinations of the  Compensation Committee of the Board (or if no such committee, the Board) in respect of the cash incentive  program shall be final and binding on all parties. Your target cash incentive award is 150% of your  annualized base salary, based on performance, subject to the terms of the Company&#8217;s cash incentive plan  as in effect from time to time or any successor plan (&#8220;Cash Incentive Award&#8221;).  (c) Long Term Incentives. During the Employment Term, for any completed fiscal year of the  Company, Executive may be eligible to earn an equity incentive award from the Company.  Equity incentive  awards, if any, shall be made under, and subject to the terms of, the Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. 2023  Equity Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to time (the &#8220;Equity Plan&#8221;) and any related written  award agreement.  Any awards granted to Executive under the Equity Plan shall be communicated by, and  be subject to the terms and conditions of, a written award agreement between the Company and Executive.   Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Executive shall be considered annually for eligibility to  receive a grant of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the Equity Plan and performance stock units (PSUs)  in the discretion of the Board. Any such grant shall vest subject to the Executive&#8217;s continued employment  with the Company through the applicable vesting date(s) and subject to the Company&#8217;s achievement of  target performance metrics to be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board (or if no such  committee, the Board) in its sole discretion.  The Company shall not have any obligation to grant such  awards.  Executive acknowledges that Executive may be required to execute additional documents in  connection with the grant of any equity incentive award or the exercise or settlement of such awards. While  the Company has no obligation to grant such awards, the current expectation is to calibrate your aggregate  long term incentive award at 230% of your annualized base salary (subject to pro-ration for any partial year  of employment), with the mechanics of the calibration determined by the aforementioned Compensation  Committee in its sole discretion.  (d) Value Appreciation Pool.  As at the date of this Agreement, Executive has been granted a  one-time award of 300,000 (Three Hundred Thousand) Units of the Company&#8217;s Value Appreciation Pool  (&#8220;VAP&#8221;). The VAP award is subject to and governed by the VAP Rules, adopted 18 September 2020 (as  may be amended from time to time), and the terms and conditions of a written award agreement between  the Company and Executive. Executive acknowledges that Executive may be required to execute additional  documents in connection with the grant of the VAP award or the exercise or settlement of such award.  (e) Benefits.  During the Employment Term and subject to satisfaction of applicable eligibility  criteria, Executive shall be entitled to participate in the employee benefit plans and insurance programs  generally provided to Executives of the Company from time to time, in accordance with their terms. Nothing  herein shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from amending or terminating any such plan or program  in its sole and absolute discretion.  (f) Vacation. During the Employment Term, Executive shall be entitled to twenty-five (25)  paid business days as vacation, to be accrued, used, paid and forfeited in accordance with the Company&#8217;s  policies as in effect from time to time.   (g) Currency. All amounts (if any) paid or payable by the Company to Executive hereunder  shall be denominated in U.S. dollars.   (h) Applicable Withholding. All payments under this Agreement shall be subject to all  applicable foreign, federal, state and local withholdings, as well as all authorized or required deductions.  </FONT></DIV>
