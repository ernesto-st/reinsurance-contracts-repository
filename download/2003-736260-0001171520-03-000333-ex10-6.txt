            4 of this Agreement, or any other material adverse change or
            significant reduction in position, titles, reporting lines,

            receipt by the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of
            Directors of JHFS, as applicable, of written notice thereof given by

            anniversary date of the Effective Time of the Merger (as such terms

      that are duplicative of any payments or benefits provided to the Executive
      by any of the Company, JHFS or Manulife under any other agreement or plan
      that provides for payments or benefits upon a change of control. Manulife
      further acknowledges and

      payable to the Executive pursuant to the provisions of Sections 7(c), 7(d)
      and 7(f) of the Restated Agreement and (2) the amounts that would be
      payable to the Executive if the Executive were entitled to receive the
      payments and benefits set forth in such Sections as of the Closing Date
      (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case as such
      methodologies and amounts are set forth on Schedule A attached hereto.

      Company shall designate in writing primary and alternate Accountants to
      Manulife on or prior to the Closing Date.

8.    Except as amended by this Amendment, all other terms of the Restated
      Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; provided, that, until the
      earlier to occur of (i) the date that this Amendment terminates and is of
      no further force and effect pursuant to Section 2 of this Amendment and
      (ii) the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company, JHFS and the Executive
      each hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Restated Agreement (as
      amended by this Amendment) shall not be amended without the prior written
      consent of Manulife.

9.    Subject to Section 8 of this Amendment, this Amendment shall be subject to
      the "Miscellaneous" provisions contained in Section 14 of the Restated
