enrollees monthly premium (or the subscribers/participants monthly
premium, if applicable) and the employers/unions monthly premiums (i.e., total monthly
premium) are less than the monthly low-income premium subsidy amount, any portion of the low-income

if there is no monthly premium charged the beneficiary (or subscriber/participant, if applicable)
