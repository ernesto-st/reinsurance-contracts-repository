In no event shall such notice and opportunity limit the right of the Funding Agent to establish
such Reserve, unless the Funding Agent shall have determined in its Permitted Discretion that the

Administrative Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request maintained with the Funding Agent
(each such Loan made solely by the U.S. Swingline Lender pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.17(a)</U>

the U.S. Swingline Loans to take place on a periodic basis as set forth in <U>Section

applicable to other Base Rate U.S. Revolving Loans funded by the U.S./European Lenders, except
that all payments thereon shall be payable to the U.S. Swingline Lender solely for its own

participation in such U.S. Swingline Loan in proportion to its Pro Rata Percentage of the
U.S./European Commitment. The U.S. Swingline Lender may, at any time, require the U.S./European
Lenders to fund their participations. From and after the date, if any, on which any
U.S./European Lender is required to fund its participation in any U.S. Swingline Loan purchased
hereunder, the Funding Agent shall promptly distribute to such Lender, such Lender&#146;s Pro Rata

Lenders of such requested Settlement by facsimile, telephone, or e-mail no later than 11:00&nbsp;a.m.
Chicago time on the date of such requested Settlement (the &#147;<B>Settlement Date</B>&#148;). Each
U.S./European Lender (other than the U.S. Swingline Lender, in the case of the U.S. Swingline

outstanding principal amount of the applicable Loan with respect to which Settlement is requested

Guarantor&#146;s Affiliates (other than such Swiss Guarantor&#146;s direct or indirect Subsidiaries) and (ii)

Guarantor makes a payment under this <U>ARTICLE VII</U> (provided such limitation is still a

thirty (30)&nbsp;Business Days from being requested to make the Guarantee Payment, with (1)&nbsp;an interim
audited balance sheet prepared by the statutory auditors of the applicable Swiss Guarantor, (2)
the determination of the Available Amount based on such interim audited balance sheet as computed
by the statutory auditors, and (3)&nbsp;a confirmation from the statutory auditors that the Available
Amount is the maximum amount which can be paid by the Swiss Guarantor under this <U>ARTICLE
VII</U> without breaching the provisions of Swiss corporate law, which are aimed at protecting
the share capital and legal reserves, and (ii)&nbsp;upon receipt of the confirmation referred to in
the preceding sentence under (3)&nbsp;and after having taken all actions required pursuant to
paragraph (d)&nbsp;below, make such Guarantee Payment in full (less, if required, any Swiss
Withholding Tax).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;If so required under Swiss law (including double tax treaties to which Switzerland is a
party) at the time it is required to make a payment under this <U>ARTICLE VII</U> or the
Security Documents, the applicable Swiss Guarantor (1)&nbsp;may deduct the Swiss Withholding Tax at
the rate of 35% (or such other rate as may be in force at such time) from any payment under this
<U>ARTICLE VII</U> or the Security Documents, (2)&nbsp;may pay the Swiss Withholding Tax to the Swiss
Federal Tax Administration, and (3)&nbsp;shall notify and provide evidence to the Funding Agent that
the Swiss Withholding Tax has been paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. To the extent
the Guarantee Payment due is less than the Available Amount, the applicable Swiss Guarantor shall
be required to make a gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the Secured Parties for the
deduction of the Swiss Withholding Tax, it being understood that at no time shall the Guarantee
Payment (including any gross-up or indemnification payment pursuant to this paragraph (c)&nbsp;and
including any Swiss Withholding Tax levied thereon) exceed the Available Amount. The applicable
Swiss Guarantor shall use its best efforts to ensure that any person which is, as a result of a
payment under this <U>ARTICLE VII</U>, entitled to a full or partial refund of the Swiss
Withholding Tax, shall as soon as possible after the deduction of the Swiss Withholding Tax (i)
request a refund

a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default,
regardless of whether any Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge
of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any
Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the &#147;<B>Additional Cost Rate</B>&#148;) for each Lender,
in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the
Funding Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders&#146; Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion
to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a
percentage rate per annum.

Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Funding Agent. This percentage
will be certified by that Lender in its notice to the Funding Agent to be its reasonable
determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender&#146;s participation in all Loans
made from that Facility Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European
Central Bank in respect of loans made from that Facility Office.
