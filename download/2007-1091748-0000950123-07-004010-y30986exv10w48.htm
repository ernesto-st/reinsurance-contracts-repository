that after payment by the Executive of all income, excise, employment and other taxes on the
Gross-Up Payment (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) the Executive
retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Total Payments.

are &#147;parachute payments&#148; (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code), in each case which
determinations are required to be made under this paragraph, including whether a Gross-Up Payment
is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, and amounts relevant to the last sentence of this
paragraph, shall be made by an independent accounting firm retained by the Company as selected by
the Executive from among the largest four accounting firms in the United States (the
&#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;). The Accounting Firm shall provide to the Company and to the Executive
its determination (the

of any Gross-Up Payment and any other relevant matter, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after receipt of notice
from the Executive reasonably requesting a Determination or such earlier time as is requested by
the Company. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it
shall furnish the Executive with a written statement that such Accounting Firm has concluded that
no Excise Tax is payable (including the basis for such conclusion) and that the Executive has
&#147;<U>substantial authority</U>&#148; within the meaning of Treasury Regulation&nbsp;1.6662-4(d) not to report

Gross-Up Payments will have been made by the Company and the Executive that should not have been
made (&#147;<U>Overpayments</U>&#148;). In either such event, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount
of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred. In the case of an Underpayment, the Company
promptly shall pay, or cause to be paid, the amount of such Underpayment to or for the benefit of
the Executive. In the case of an Overpayment, the Executive shall, at the direction and expense of
the Company, take such steps as are reasonably necessary (including the filing of returns and
claims for refund), follow reasonable instructions from and procedures established by, the Company,
and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Company to correct such Overpayment; provided, however,
that (1)&nbsp;the Executive shall not in any event be obligated to return to the Company an amount
greater than the net after-tax portion of the Overpayment that he has retained or recovered as a
refund from the applicable taxing authorities and (2)&nbsp;this provision shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent with the intent of Section 10(a) above, which is to make the Executive whole, on
an after-tax basis, from the application of the Excise Tax, it being understood that the correction
of an Overpayment may result in the Executive repaying to the Company an amount that is less than
the Overpayment. Any payment to be made to correct an Underpayment or Overpayment, as the case may
be, (the &#147;<U>Correcting Payment</U>&#148;) shall be accompanied by an interest payment on the
Correcting Payment at an annual rate of 8% for the period from the date of the Gross-Up Payment
through the date of payment of the Correcting Payment.
