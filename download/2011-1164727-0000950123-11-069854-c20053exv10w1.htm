any such termination, the terminated Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall
continue to have all the rights of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such termination, but shall not issue any additional
Letters of Credit. Without limiting the foregoing, following the delivery by the Borrower of any

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On November&nbsp;11, 2008, St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. (&#147;St. Andrew&#148;) filed an Application in the
Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking a declaration to clarify St. Andrew&#146;s royalty
obligations regarding certain mineral rights and property formerly owned by Newmont Canada and now
owned by St. Andrew.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Newmont Canada purchased the property, called the Holt-McDermott property (&#147;Holt Property&#148;), from
Barrick Gold Corporation (&#147;Barrick&#148;) in October&nbsp;2004. At that time, Newmont Canada entered into a
royalty agreement with Barrick (the &#147;Barrick Royalty&#148;), allowing Barrick to retain a royalty on the
Holt Property. In August&nbsp;2006, Newmont Canada sold all of its interests in the Holt Property to
Holloway Mining Company (&#147;Holloway&#148;) in exchange for common stock issued by Holloway. In September
2006, Newmont Canada entered into a purchase and sale agreement with St. Andrew (the &#147;2006
Agreement&#148;), under which St. Andrew acquired all the common stock of Holloway. In 2008, Barrick
sold its Barrick Royalty to Royal Gold, Inc. (&#147;Royal Gold&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the court proceedings, St. Andrew alleged that in the 2006 Agreement it only agreed to assume
royalty obligations equal to 0.013% of net smelter returns from operations on the Holt Property.
Such an interpretation of the 2006 Agreement makes Newmont responsible for any royalties exceeding
that amount payable to Royal Gold pursuant to the Barrick Royalty, which is a royalty determined by
multiplying 0.00013 by the quarterly average gold price. On July&nbsp;23, 2009, the Superior Court
issued a decision finding in favor of St. Andrews&#146; interpretation. On August&nbsp;21, 2009, Newmont
Canada appealed the decision. On May&nbsp;13, 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the lower court
ruling, finding Newmont liable for the sliding scale royalty, which equals a 13% royalty at a
quarterly average gold price of $1,000, minus a 0.013% of net smelter returns. There is no cap on
the sliding scale royalty and it increases or decreases with the gold price, based upon the
multiplication of 0.00013 by the quarterly average gold price.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>NWG Investments Inc. v. Fronteer Gold, Inc.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2011, Newmont Mining Corporation (&#147;Newmont&#148;) acquired Fronteer Gold Inc. (&#147;Fronteer&#148;).
Fronteer has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court by an NWG
Investments Inc. (&#147;NWG&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Fronteer acquired NewWest Gold Corporation (&#147;NewWest Gold&#148;) in September&nbsp;2007. At the time of that
acquisition, NWG owned approximately 86% of NewWest Gold and an individual named Jacob Safra owned
or controlled 100% of NWG. Prior to its acquisition of NewWest Gold, Fronteer entered into a June
2007 lock-up agreement with NWG providing that, among other things, NWG would support Fronteer&#146;s
acquisition of NewWest Gold. At that time, Fronteer owned approximately 42% of Aurora Energy
Resources Inc. (&#147;Aurora&#148;), which, among other things, had a uranium exploration project in
Labrador, Canada.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">NWG contends that, during the negotiations leading up to the lock-up agreement, Fronteer
represented to NWG that Aurora would commence uranium mining in Labrador by 2013, that this was a
firm date, that Fronteer was not aware of any obstacle to doing so, that Aurora faced no serious
environmental issues in Labrador and that Aurora&#146;s competitors faced greater delays in commencing
uranium mining. NWG further contends that it entered into the lock-up agreement and agreed to
support Fronteer&#146;s acquisition of NewWest Gold in reliance upon these purported representations.
On October&nbsp;11, 2007, less than three weeks after the Fronteer-NewWest Gold transaction closed, a
member of the Nunatsiavut Assembly introduced a motion calling for the adoption of a moratorium on
uranium mining in Labrador. On April&nbsp;8, 2008 the Nunatsiavut Assembly adopted a three-year
moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. NWG contends that Fronteer was aware during the
negotiations of the NWG/Fronteer lock-up agreement that the Nunatsiavut Assembly planned on
adopting this moratorium and that its adoption would preclude Aurora from commencing uranium mining by 2013, but Fronteer nonetheless fraudulently induced NWG to enter
into the lock-up agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">NWG has not yet filed or served a complaint upon Fronteer or Newmont. Newmont intends to defend
this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.

guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the Obligations of the Borrower. The
Guarantor further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the Obligations of the Borrower may
be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that
it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of
any Obligation.

the Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement, any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii)&nbsp;any
extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (iii)&nbsp;any rescission, waiver, amendment or

Obligations; or (vii)&nbsp;any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in
any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of
the Guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the
Guarantor to subrogation.

may have at law or in equity against the Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the
Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by
acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Guarantor hereby promises to and will,
upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Administrative Agent for distribution to the applicable Lenders in cash an amount equal to the
unpaid principal amount of such Obligation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">(g)&nbsp;Upon payment in full by the Guarantor of any Obligation of the Borrower, each Lender
shall, in a reasonable manner, assign to the Guarantor the amount of such Obligation owed to such
Lender and so paid, such assignment to be pro tanto to the extent to which the Obligation in
question was discharged by the Guarantor, or make such disposition thereof as the Guarantor shall
direct (all without recourse to any Lender and without any representation or warranty by any
Lender). Upon payment by the Guarantor of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Guarantor
against the Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall
in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in
full of all the Obligations owed by the Borrower to the Lenders (it being understood that, after
the discharge of all the Obligations due and payable from the Borrower, such rights may be
exercised by the Guarantor notwithstanding that the Borrower may remain contingently liable for
indemnity or other Obligations).

Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive

unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;11, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No
notice or demand on the Guarantor in any case shall entitle the Guarantor to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any
