rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that,
after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the &#147;IBA&#148;) for purposes of the
IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the
interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. Upon
the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Opt-In</FONT> Election, <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;2.16</U> provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent

interest from time to time in force, and all agreements between the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries and the Lenders, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether oral or written, are hereby expressly limited so that in no
contingency or event whatsoever, whether by acceleration of maturity hereof or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid in the aggregate to the Lenders as interest (whether or not designated as interest, and including any amount
otherwise designated but deemed to constitute interest by a court of competent jurisdiction) hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or in any other agreement given to secure the Indebtedness evidenced hereby or other Obligations of the
Borrower, or in any other document evidencing, securing or pertaining to the Indebtedness evidenced hereby, exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable usury or such other laws (the &#147;<U>Maximum Amount</U>&#148;). If under any
circumstances whatsoever fulfillment of any provision hereof, or any of the other Loan Documents, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the Maximum Amount, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled
shall be reduced to the Maximum Amount. For the purposes of calculating the actual amount of interest paid and/or payable hereunder in respect of laws pertaining to usury or such other laws, all sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder hereof
for the use, forbearance or detention of the Indebtedness of the Borrower evidenced hereby, outstanding from time to time shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be amortized, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-rated,</FONT> allocated
and spread from the date of disbursement of the proceeds of the Loans until payment in full of all of such Indebtedness, so that the actual rate of interest on account of such Indebtedness is uniform through the term hereof. The terms and provisions
of this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;11.20(a)</U> shall control and supersede every other provision of all agreements between the Borrower or any endorser of the Loans and the Lenders. </P>

amount shall be deemed a payment in reduction of the principal amount of the Loans and shall be treated as a voluntary prepayment under <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;2.10</U> and shall be so applied in accordance with
<U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;2.17</U> or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of the Loans and any other Indebtedness of the Borrower in favor of such Lender, the excess shall be deemed to have been a payment made by mistake and
shall be refunded to the Borrower. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">11.21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Lender Action</U>. Each Lender agrees that it shall not take or

lien or similar claim or other rights of self-help), or institute any actions or proceedings, or otherwise commence any remedial procedures, with respect to any Collateral or any other property of any such Loan Party, unless expressly provided for
herein or in any other Loan Document, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. The provisions of this Section&nbsp;11.21 are for the sole benefit of the Lenders and shall not afford any right to, or constitute a defense
available to, any Loan Party. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">11.22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Fiduciary Duty</U>. Each of the Lender-Related Parties may have economic

Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered
