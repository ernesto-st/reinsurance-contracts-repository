sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Shares and is capable of bearing the
economic risks of such investment. Buyer and its representatives have examined books, records, and
documents furnished or made available to them by the Sellers, the Group Companies, and their
Subsidiaries, and have been given the opportunity to ask such questions of, and receive answers

be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or

Agreement, and the Indemnified Parties subsequently receive insurance proceeds for the same claim
or event, then the Indemnified Parties shall refund such indemnity Damage payments to the
Indemnifying Parties from such insurance proceeds to the extent that the Indemnified Party has
received benefits from both sources (i.e., payments of indemnity Damages from the Indemnifying

gives rise to a currently realizable Tax Benefit (as defined below) to the Indemnified Party making
the Claim, then the amount of Damages shall be (i)&nbsp;increased to take account of any net Tax cost
incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed
up for such increase) and (ii)&nbsp;reduced to take account of any net Tax Benefit actually or
reasonably expected to be realized by the Indemnified Party arising from circumstances underlying
or the incurrence or payment of any such Damages for all applicable Tax periods (past, present and
future). For purposes of this Section&nbsp;8.6(b), a &#147;<B>Tax Benefit</B>&#148; means an amount by which the Tax
liability of the Party (or group of corporations including the Party) is actually reduced
(including by deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise,
entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the relevant
taxing authority. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax Benefit, the indemnified
Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit
before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the
incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss. The amount of any increase, reduction or payment
hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any final determination (which shall include the execution
of Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the Indemnified Party&#146;s liability for Taxes, and
payments between the parties to this Agreement to reflect such adjustment shall be made if
necessary. Any indemnity payment under this Article&nbsp;8 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, unless a final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or
successor form) with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates causes any such
payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for United States federal income
tax purposes.

other relevant items (including, for example and without limitation, any adjustments or additions
to the Purchase Price) of such S Corporation Company among the assets of such S Corporation Company
and its QSS in accordance with Code &#167;&#167; 338 and 1060 and the regulations thereunder. In the event
that, after the Purchase Price allocation is determined, the Purchase Price is adjusted, the
Purchase Price allocation shall also be adjusted. To the extent permitted by the Code or other
applicable tax law, any adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be allocated, to the extent
possible, to the classes of assets that were the subject of the adjustments to the Purchase Price.
The Purchase Price allocation, including any adjustments thereto, will be binding on Buyer and
Sellers. Each of the Parties shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns, claims for
refunds, and Internal Revenue Service Form&nbsp;8594) in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price
allocation, including any adjustments thereto. Neither Party will take any position (whether in
audits or similar proceedings, Tax Returns, refund claims, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with
such allocation, except as required to do so by applicable law. Each of Buyer and Seller will use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to sustain such allocation in any subsequent audit,
similar proceeding, appeal, or court proceeding.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the consent of Davis (which he may withhold in his discretion), NPHC and its
affiliates will not offer employment or pay the bonus amounts to Stan Ashley (&#147;Ashley&#148;) indicated
in that certain Letter Agreement, dated as of the date hereof and between the parties hereto (the
&#147;Letter Agreement&#148;), unless Ashley reaches an agreement approved by Davis, NPHC and Buyer for the
sale or redemption of Ashley&#146;s stock (the &#147;Transfer&#148;) in CPAI and related transactions with
appropriate releases respecting certain disputed matters (collectively the &#147;Ashley Agreements&#148;).
NPHC and Buyer will not unreasonably withhold or delay approval of the Ashley Agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Davis and Ashley agree in writing to execute the Ashley Agreements, then Sellers and NPHC
and its affiliates will work together to promptly mutually agree on amendments to this Agreement
and related documents (including Ashley&#146;s employment agreement): (a)&nbsp;in such a manner as to
accommodate the terms of the Ashley Agreements, such as an annual bonus for Ashley equal to twenty
percent (20%) of CPAI&#146;s profits, a minimum one-year employment term at a base salary of one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000), and a license agreement for the PCDS software with Ashcart Corporation
(an affiliate of Ashley); and (b)&nbsp;to conform this Agreement and related agreements to the
foregoing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith for the amendments to this Agreement and related
agreements and to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve and accommodate the objectives of
the Ashley Agreements. The Parties agree that Ashley is not a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement or the Letter Agreement.
