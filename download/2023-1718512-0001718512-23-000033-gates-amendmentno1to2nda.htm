None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the U.S. Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer may be liable to the U.S. Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrowers which the U.S. Borrower proves were caused by such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.

Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, if, as of the Letter of Credit(g) Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the U.S. Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations.  Sections 2.05 and 8.02(iii) set forth certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder.

Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings.  The Borrowers hereby grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of each L/C Issuer and the U.S. Revolving Credit Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.  Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Citibank.  If at any time the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all such L/C Obligations, the U.S. Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited as Cash Collateral, an amount equal to the excess of (x) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (y) the total amount of such funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim.  Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Laws, to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer.  If on any Revaluation Date and solely as a result of changes in Spot Rates, the Alternative Currency L/C Obligations would exceed the Alternative Currency L/C Sublimit, immediate prepayment or Cash Collateralization of amounts owing in respect of outstanding Alternative Currency Letters of Credit will be made on or in respect of such Alternative Currency L/C Obligations in an amount equal to the difference. Applicability of ISP and UCP.  Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer(h) and the U.S. Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance, shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. Letter of Credit Fees.

If the amount so held shall at any time be insufficient to make and pay all such Revolving Credit Loans and amounts required to be made or paid at such time, the Administrative Agent shall apply such held funds in the following order of priority:  first, to the Agents for any amounts then due and payable by such Defaulting Lender to them hereunder (other than on account of any Protective Advances), in their capacities as such, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due and payable to the Agents, second, to the Administrative Agent (on account of any outstanding Protective Advances) L/C Issuers and the Swing Line Lender for any amounts then due and payable to them hereunder, in their capacities as such, by such Defaulting Lender, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due and payable to such Lenders, and third, to any other Lenders for any amount then due and payable by such Defaulting Lender to such other Lenders hereunder, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due and payable to such other Lenders.  In the event that any Defaulting Lender ceases to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds held by the Administrative Agent in escrow at such time with respect to such Lender shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to such Lender and applied by such Lender Party to the Secured Obligations owing to such Lender at such time under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents ratably in accordance with the respective amounts of such Secured Obligations outstanding at such time.

In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

Obligations of Lenders Several.  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving(d) Credit Loans, to fund L/C Participations, Swing Line Participations and Protective Advance Participations and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c). Funding Source.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for(e) any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. Insufficient Funds.  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the(f) Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder (other than in respect of Bank Product Debt), ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, (ii) second, toward payment of principal amount of any L/C Borrowings, Swing Line Loans and any Protective Advances ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties and (iii) third, toward payment of principal and Bank Product Debt then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and L/C Borrowings then due to such parties; provided that (i) amounts received from any Canadian Loan Party shall be applied solely to the Canadian Obligations (as specified above) and (ii) amounts received from any U.S. Loan Party shall be applied to the Secured Obligations described above that are not Canadian Obligations prior to being applied to any Secured Obligations described above that are Canadian Obligations.

Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such documentation obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, deliver promptly to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the applicable withholding agent) or promptly notify the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its inability to do so. Unless the applicable withholding agent has received forms or other documents satisfactory to it indicating that payments under any Loan Document to or for a Lender are not subject to withholding Tax or are subject to such Tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the U.S. Borrower, the Administrative Agent or other applicable withholding agent shall withhold amounts required to be withheld by applicable Law from such payments at the applicable statutory rate.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause (d), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this clause (d) that such Lender is not legally able to deliver.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Lender with respect to a(iv) Canadian Loan Party shall, if it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies reasonably requested by U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto or, where the Canadian Loan Party is a Guarantor, the date when the Guarantee is called upon, duly completed and executed copies of Form NR301, NR302 or NR303, as applicable, to the extent the Lender is for purposes of the ITA a non-resident of Canada, or a partnership that is not a &#8220;Canadian partnership,&#8221; and is, or whose partners are, claiming benefits of an income tax treaty to which Canada is a party. Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.01 and Section(e) 3.04(a) shall, if requested by a Borrower, use its reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office (or take any other measures reasonably requested by a Borrower) if such a change or other measures would reduce any such additional amounts (including any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, result in any unreimbursed cost or expense or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender. If any Lender or Agent receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as(f) to which indemnification or additional amounts have been paid to it by any Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly remit such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnification or additional amounts paid by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant taxing authority with respect to such refund); provided that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, agrees promptly to return such refund (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxing authority) to such party in the event such party is required to repay such refund to the relevant taxing authority.  This section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to Taxes that it deems confidential) to a Borrower or any other person. -134- CG&amp;R Draft Current date:  03/02/2023 10:05 AM 63515514v23CG&amp;R Draft Current date:  03/01/2023 4:17 PM 70014411v6 </FONT></DIV>

Subrogation; Subordination.  Each Canadian Guarantor hereby agrees that until theSection 12.04 payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Canadian Guaranteed Obligations (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements and Cash Management Agreements not yet due and payable and (y) contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable) and the expiration or termination of the Canadian Revolving Credit Commitments of the Canadian Revolving Credit Lenders under this Agreement, it shall waive any claim and shall not exercise any right or remedy, direct or indirect, arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 12.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against the Canadian Borrower or any other Canadian Guarantor or any U.S. Guarantor of any of the Canadian Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Canadian Guaranteed Obligations.
