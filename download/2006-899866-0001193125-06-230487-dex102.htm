Lender may, as far as Borrower can give authority therefor, with or without judicial process, enter (if this can be done without breach of the peace) upon any premises on which any of the Collateral or any part thereof may be situated. Without
limitation of the foregoing, Lender shall be entitled to hold, maintain, preserve and prepare all of the Collateral for sale and to dispose of said Collateral, if Lender so chooses, from the Mortgaged Property provided that Lender may require
Borrower to assemble such UCC Collateral and make it available to Lender for disposition at a place to be designated by Lender from which the UCC Collateral would be sold or disposed of, and provided further that, for a reasonable period of time
prior to the disposition of such UCC Collateral, Lender shall have the right to use same in the operation of the Mortgaged Property. Borrower will execute and deliver to Lender any and all forms, documents, certificates and registrations as may be
necessary or appropriate to enable Lender to sell and deliver good and clear title to the UCC Collateral to the buyer at the sale as herein provided. Unless the UCC Collateral is of the type customarily sold on a recognized market, Lender will give
Borrower at least ten (10)&nbsp;days&#146; written notice of the time and place of any public sale of such UCC Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or any other intended disposition thereof is to be made. The requirements of
reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is given to Borrower in writing at least ten (10)&nbsp;days before the time of the sale or disposition. Lender may buy at any public sale and, if the UCC Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a
recognized market or is a type which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations, it may buy at private sale. Unless Lender shall otherwise elect, any sale of the UCC Collateral shall be solely as a unit and not in separate lots

Borrower, and of the Mortgaged Property, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of foreclosure of all or any of the Mortgage, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in
inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale of the Mortgaged Property for the
collection of the obligations without any prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the payment of the obligations owing Lender on account of the Loan Documents out of the net proceeds of the Mortgaged Property in
preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In addition, Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage, any equitable right otherwise available to Borrower which would require the separate

other than a compulsory counterclaim or defense of performance, in any action or proceeding brought against it by Lender or its agents. No failure or delay on the part of Lender or any holder of any Note in the exercise of any power, right or

privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or

Lender enforces its remedies or exercise its rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or
