information in Argus databases is derived from third party sources and is not independently
developed by Argus, and Argus utilizes industry materials and the advice and resources of outside
vendors and healthcare professionals to provide Argus services, (b)&nbsp;the usefulness of the
information provided by Argus is necessarily limited by the amount of information received by

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>A.&nbsp;Access to Systems</B>. With respect to each service Argus is to provide to Customer allowing
Customer access to an Argus system or database, Argus shall provide Customer with Access
Information. If Argus requires, Customer shall inform Argus of the identity of authorized users,
of additions and deletions to the list of users, and of access rights of individual users and
shall ensure that Access Information is not provided to users not designated to Argus. Passwords
will expire periodically, which will require entry of a new password for each user on a regular
interval defined by Argus. Customer shall provide at its expense, the equipment, software and
communications network transmission capabilities necessary to access Argus databases and systems.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>B.&nbsp;Customer Data Provided for Input</B>. If Customer is providing data to Argus, Customer shall

equipment or performance of services, Argus will replace such media, but not the data on such
media, at Argus&#146; expense. Argus shall not be liable for the loss of any data on Customer media,
but shall be responsible for all Customer data created and maintained on the Argus systems

conjunction with Argus&#146; services entails confidentiality and other risks that may be beyond Argus&#146;

reasonable encryption and other protocols to protect against unauthorized interception,
corruption, use of or access to Proprietary Information that it receives and/or disseminates over
the Internet (&#147;Internet Protocol&#148;). Argus may, but shall not be required to, modify the Internet

not diminish the security of Argus&#146; systems.

reviewed Exhibit&nbsp;C hereto and shall pay all charges and fees set forth therein for services
Customer has selected as of the Effective Date and for Argus&#146; reasonable expenses, including
without limitation those reasonable expenses set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;C. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties agree that Customer&#146;s accounts payable and audit processes may identify
incorrect charges and fees, which may result in credits to Customer as appropriate. In addition,
Argus agrees to provide Customer with a Paid Claims File (&#147;PCT&#148;) that includes unaltered claims
data as submitted by the Pharmacy, all relevant PDE fields, as agreed, and all payment fields for
reconciliation of Part&nbsp;D claims, to accompany every invoice. Invoices that do not have
accompanying data for complete payment and reconciliation by Customer Accounts Payable or its
contractors will not be considered payable by Customer. For services not selected by Customer at
the Effective Date but later selected by Customer (&#147;Additional Services&#148;), Customer shall pay
Argus at the rates set forth on Exhibit&nbsp;C for such Additional Services or at such other rates as
are reflected in a modified Exhibit&nbsp;C to which Argus and Customer have agreed in writing prior to
the rendering of the Additional Services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Customer shall pay Argus within fifteen (15)&nbsp;calendar days of the receipt of each invoice (the
&#147;Invoice Payment Date&#148;). Prior to the application of any late charges or the event of a default as
defined under this MSA, Customer shall be entitled to a fifteen (15)&nbsp;day grace period. In the
event of a payment dispute Customer shall provide adequate written notice and documentation of
such dispute to Argus no later than the Invoice Payment Date. Customer shall work diligently with
Argus to promptly resolve such dispute. Within fifteen (15)&nbsp;calendar days of the resolution of
such dispute (the &#147;Dispute Payment Date&#148;), Customer shall remit to Argus the agreed-upon amount.
For any amounts that are due hereunder and are not received by Argus by the Invoice Payment Date or the Dispute Payment Date, Customer shall pay to Argus a late charge at the lesser
of one percent (1%) per month or the maximum rate of interest allowed by law until such invoice is
paid in full. Customer acknowledges that Argus may utilize a lockbox account to manage fees and
expenses received by Customer and that financial institutions that provide lockbox services may
refuse to review or to advise Argus of notations on payment instruments. Customer therefore
agrees not to attempt to effect an accord or satisfaction through a payment instrument or
accompanying written communication and not to conditionally or restrictively endorse a payment
instrument, and Argus shall not be bound by any such attempt or endorsement. Customer shall
reimburse Argus for its expenses, including attorneys&#146; fees, in enforcing this Section&nbsp;7 if such
expenses arise as a result of fault on the part of Customer.

party during implementation of services and throughout the term of the Agreement as necessary for
the performance of the parties&#146; respective obligations hereunder. As soon as necessary for Argus
to fulfill its obligations under this MSA, and otherwise within a reasonable period of time,
Customer shall respond to any requests by Argus for information or determinations needed by Argus
to perform the services set forth herein. Customer shall provide to Argus valid, correct,
properly formatted and transmitted data and any other information necessary for Argus to fulfill
its obligations to Customer. Argus agrees to provide to Customer the policies and procedures for
Argus testing to verify that data provided by Customer is properly loaded and tested prior to its
implementation. When Customer and Argus have agreed that Customer shall conduct testing of or
review the testing results of a process or method, Customer shall have an obligation to promptly
notify Argus of any error in the process or method. In the event an error is identified in either
the testing or subsequent audit or review process Argus agrees to take prompt action to mitigate
damages from further errors and re-perform the service as provided in Section&nbsp;9.B. Customer shall
advise Argus of any Argus error, failure in performance, or inconsistency within a prompt period
of time after discovery and in any event no later than the earlier of one year from the occurrence
or sixty (60)&nbsp;days after termination or expiration of the Agreement. Argus shall have no
responsibility to make adjustments with respect to and shall not be liable for errors about which
Customer failed to give such notice to Argus.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>A.&nbsp;Warranty</B>. Argus shall at all times use reasonable commercial efforts to fulfill its
obligations under each Services Addendum to this MSA; provided, however, Argus&#146; commercial efforts
shall not be deemed unreasonable to the extent Argus&#146; ability to perform was affected by
Customer&#146;s breach of its obligations hereunder or Argus was complying with Customer&#146;s
instructions. Notwithstanding the above Argus warrants to its actual knowledge as of the date
Argus executes this MSA that the use by Customer of the software and systems as described herein
will in no way constitute an infringement or other violation of any copyright, trade secret,
trademark, patent, invention, proprietary information, non-disclosure, or other rights of any
third party. Argus will notify Customer if a court decides that an infringement or other
violation exists (now or later) and will take action to mitigate damage caused by the infringement
or violation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>B.&nbsp;Re-Performance Obligations</B>. In the event of any claim by Customer that Argus has not
performed its obligations to provide services as required by this MSA, the sole obligation of
Argus shall be to re-perform any service which does not conform to this MSA at Argus&#146; expense,
provided that such failure to perform is not due to an act or omission by Customer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer acknowledges that certain situations, including but not
limited to, insolvency or dissolution of a Contracted Pharmacy may preclude Argus&#146; ability to
fully re-perform its obligations in accordance with this MSA. In those situations, Argus agrees to
utilize best efforts in all cases to complete its re-performance obligations within commercially

controversy arising out of or relating to this MSA by negotiation. The following procedures will
apply to any such negotiations:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(a)&nbsp;Notice</B>. A party commences the negotiation process by giving the other party written
notice of any dispute not resolved in the ordinary course of business. The notice will expressly
state that the notifying party is commencing the negotiation process provided for in this section;
identify the issues and the amounts in dispute; and, will be delivered in accordance with Section
20.A of this MSA.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(b)&nbsp;Meeting</B>. Within 10 Business Days after delivery of the written notice commencing the
negotiation process, representatives of both parties will meet in a manner and at a time and place
that is mutually acceptable to the representatives involved for the purpose of exchanging relevant
information and in an effort to resolve the disputes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(c)&nbsp;Representatives</B>. Each party&#146;s representative(s) at any meeting conducted pursuant to this
Exhibit&nbsp;E will have authority to resolve the dispute(s) identified in the notice. If a party&#146;s
representative intends to be accompanied at any meeting by an attorney, the other party will be
given not less than 5 Business Days&#146; notice of such intention and may also be accompanied by an
attorney.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(d)&nbsp;Termination of Process</B>. If a dispute is not resolved at the initial meeting of the
parties&#146; representatives, the parties may agree to continue the negotiation process by scheduling
additional meetings and/or including additional representatives. However, at any time after the
first meeting either party may terminate the negotiation process by delivery of written notice to
that effect to the other party in accordance with Section&nbsp;20.A of this MSA.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(e)&nbsp;Negotiations Not Evidence</B>. Any and all communications and negotiations between the
parties pursuant to this Exhibit&nbsp;E are Proprietary Information of both of the parties and will be
treated as negotiations of settlement and compromise as provided for in the Federal Rules of
Evidence or any state&#146;s rules of evidence. The substance of any such communications and
negotiations are not to be tendered or introduced into evidence in any proceeding or litigation
between the parties regarding the subject disputes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.&nbsp;Arbitration/Litigation</B>. The parties will continue to operate under this MSA pending the
dispute resolution procedure set forth in this Exhibit&nbsp;E, except that a party may terminate this
MSA as permitted in the MSA if the other party fails to cure a default or as otherwise permitted in
the MSA. Neither party may file suit or commence an arbitration proceeding in accordance with the
terms of this MSA until the parties meet as described in Section&nbsp;1 of this Exhibit&nbsp;E. If a party
refuses to meet or if the negotiations are unsuccessful, either party may file suit in a court of
competent jurisdiction or commence an arbitration proceeding as described below. The parties must
submit an issue or dispute that isn&#146;t resolved
as described in Section&nbsp;1 of this Exhibit&nbsp;E to mandatory arbitration under certain

arbitrator will serve strictly in a neutral capacity. Each arbitrator will disclose any facts that
might bear upon his or her ability to serve in a neutral capacity to both parties. Any challenges

list of 9 qualified potential arbitrators from its roster. If any of the initial 9 potential
arbitrators cannot serve because of a conflict or other reason, the AAA will supplement the list so
that the parties have a total of 9 potential arbitrators from which to select the panel of 3
arbitrators. Each party will be entitled to strike 3 names from the list. Strikes will be made on
alternating basis, with the original claimant making the first strike, followed by the respondent
until each party has used all 3 of its strikes. The 3 persons not stricken will serve as
arbitrators. Within 5 Business Days after their appointment, the arbitrators will select the
chairman of the panel and provide notice of such selection to the AAA and the parties. If a
vacancy on the panel arises for any reason, a replacement arbitrator will be selected in accordance
with AAA&#146;s rules and procedures.

network schedule to apply, Argus must receive Claims in Argus Format at point of sale from
Contracted Pharmacy. Customer understands that Argus Pharmacies may terminate their participation
in an Argus Network upon six months notice, or as otherwise negotiated, and thus that the
composition of the Network selected by Customer may change during the term of this agreement. The
Argus Network pricing established herein represents the rates targeted for contract negotiations
with Argus Pharmacies. Argus warrants that Customer will receive the benefit of any and all rates
negotiated for Customer even to the extent that contracted rates result in lower reimbursements
than indicated in the rates set forth below. Argus agrees that Participating Pharmacies that elect
to participate in the pharmacy network developed by Argus and utilized by Customer shall be
reimbursed in accordance with the contracted rates. Adherence with the contracted rates shall be
measured by Customer through an audit right, including the use of a third party auditor, to verify
Argus&#146; adherence to the transparency and pass through pricing objectives.
