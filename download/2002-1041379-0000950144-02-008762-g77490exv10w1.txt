rate as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent to be representative of
the cost of such insurance to the Lenders.

                                   The Credits

                  SECTION 2.01 Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, each Lender agrees (a) if such Lender has made a Tranche A
Term Loan Commitment, to make the Tranche A Term Loan to the Borrower in one
drawing on the Tranche A Term Loan Borrowing Date, provided that the Tranche A
Term Loan Commitments shall terminate on the Tranche A Term Loan Commitment
Termination Date, (b) if such Lender has made a Tranche B Term Loan Commitment,
to make the Tranche B Term Loan to the Borrower in one drawing on the Effective
Date, and (c) if such Lender has made a Revolving Loan Commitment, to make
Revolving Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period
in an aggregate principal amount with respect to the Revolving Loans that will
not result in such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender's
Revolving Loan Commitment. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow
Revolving Loans. Amounts repaid in respect of Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

                  SECTION 2.02 Loans and Borrowings. Each Loan (other than a
Swingline Loan) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the
same Class and Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their
respective Commitments of the applicable Class. The failure of any Lender to
make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are
several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to
make Loans as required.

                  (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.14, each Borrowing shall be
comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request
in accordance herewith; provided that all Borrowings made on the Effective Date
must be made as ABR Borrowings. Each Lender at its option may make any
Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not
affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at a rate equal
to the Swingline Lender's quoted cost of funds plus the Eurodollar Spread for

                                       24
<PAGE>

Tranche B Term Loans, but in no event will such rate exceed a rate equal to the
Alternate Base Rate plus ABR Spread for Revolving Loans, provided that for all
other purposes each Swingline Loan shall be deemed to be an ABR Loan.

                  (b) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. At the time that
each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000;
provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is
equal to the entire unused balance of the total Revolving Loan Commitments or
that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
contemplated by Section 2.06(e). Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount that
is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $1,000,000. Borrowings of
more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at the same time; provided that
there shall not at any time be more than a total of 10 Eurodollar Borrowings
outstanding.

                  (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end
after the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, the Tranche A Term Loan Maturity Date or
the Tranche B Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable, (taking into consideration
that the Tranche B Term Loan Maturity Date occurs subsequent to the Tranche A
Term Loan Maturity Date and the Revolving Loan Maturity Date).

                  SECTION 2.03 Requests for Borrowings. To request a Revolving
Loan Borrowing or a Term Loan Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a

Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an

                  with the requirements of Section 2.07.

If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with
respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed
to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following
receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.04 Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans
to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period, in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i)
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding
$15,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the total
Revolving Loan Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be
required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan.
Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

                  (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not
later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline
Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date
(which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The
Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such
notice received from the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each
Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general
deposit account of the Borrower as designated in the Borrowing Request (or, in
the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank)
by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.

                  (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the

the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Revolving Loan Lender,
specifying in such notice such Revolving Loan Lender's Applicable Percentage of
such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Loan Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Loan
Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in
Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence
and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Loan Lender shall comply with its
obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by
such Revolving Loan Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to
the payment obligations of the Revolving Loan Lenders), and the Administrative
Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it
from the


                                       26
<PAGE>

Revolving Loan Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this
paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be
made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts
received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of
the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline
Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly
remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the
Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the Revolving Loan Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this
paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided
that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to
the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is
required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of
participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve
the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form
of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to,
or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of
Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance
of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended,
renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of
Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the

extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower
also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard
form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $25,000,000
and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the total
Revolving Loan Commitments.

                  (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or
prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the
date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date; provided
that the immediately preceding clause (i) shall not prevent the Issuing Bank
from agreeing that a Letter of Credit will automatically be extended for one or
more successive periods not to exceed one year, each upon prior written request
of Borrower which will be provided at least 40 days prior to the expiration of
such Letter of Credit, so long as Issuing Bank notifies Borrower or such
beneficiary, as the case may be, in writing not less than 20 days prior to the
expiration date that it has agreed to extend for any such additional period; and
provided further, that no such extension will be made if a Default has occurred
and is continuing (and has not been waived) at the time Issuing Bank must elect
whether or not to allow such extension.

Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Loan Lender, and each Revolving Loan Lender
hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Revolving Loan Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate
amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and

circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC

LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that,
if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000 the Borrower may, subject to
the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section
2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or
Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the
Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by
the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails
to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each
Revolving Loan Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due
from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Loan Lender's Applicable
Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving
Loan Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of
the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Loan Lender (and
Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the
Revolving Loan Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the
Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Loan Lenders.
Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the
Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute
such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Loan Lenders
have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank,
then to such Revolving Loan Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may
appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Loan Lender pursuant to this paragraph
to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of
ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not
constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                  (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be


                                       28
<PAGE>

performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and
all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or
provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by
the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or
(iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute
a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders
nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability
or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of
any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder
(irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission
or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any
Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder),
any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from
causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall
not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to
the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties
hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care
in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting
the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the
terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion,
either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are
not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

                  (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

                  (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Revolving Loan Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse
the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such
payment.

<PAGE>

                  (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time with the written consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank,
each of which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Administrative
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At
the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all
unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i)
the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit.

                  (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of
the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater
than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such
date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation
to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such
deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice
of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the
Borrower described in clause (i) or (j) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be
held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance
of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative
Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right
of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the
investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and
sole discretion of the Administrative Agent or at the request of the Borrower,
and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.
Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such
account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to
reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been
reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction
of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such
time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the
consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total
LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral
hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to
the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within
three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.


                  SECTION 2.06 Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make
each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire
transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to
the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such
purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as
provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans
available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like
funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in
New York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing

                                       30
<PAGE>

Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of
an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

                  (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.07 Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Loan
Borrowing and Term Loan Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in
the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing,
shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.
Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Revolving Loan Borrowing or
the Term Loan Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and,
in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all
as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with
respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such
portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans
comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be
considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline
Loans, which may not be converted or continued.

                  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower
were requesting a Revolving Loan Borrowing of the Type resulting from such
election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic
Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly
by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest
Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by
the Borrower.

                  (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                           (i)      the Borrowing to which such Interest
                  Election Request applies and, if different options are being
                  elected with respect to different portions thereof, the
                  portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing
                  (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to
                  clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
                  resulting Borrowing);

                           (ii)     the effective date of the election made
                  pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a
                  Business Day;


                                       31
<PAGE>

                           (iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an
                  ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                           (iv)     if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar
                  Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
                  giving effect to such election, which shall be a period
                  contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                  (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long
as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be
converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.

                  SECTION 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a)
Unless previously terminated, (i) the Tranche A Term Loan Commitments shall
terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the Tranche A Term Loan Borrowing
Date, (ii) the Tranche B Term Loan Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, at the Effective Date and (iii) the Revolving Loan Commitments
shall terminate on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date.

                  (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to
time reduce, the Revolving Loan Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of
the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 (or lesser amount if the
outstanding Revolving Loan Commitments are less) and (ii) the Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments if, after giving effect to
any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the
Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Revolving Loan Commitments.

                  (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments under paragraph
(b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of
such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice
of termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments delivered by the Borrower may
state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice
to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Loans
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments
shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Revolving Loan Commitments.


                                       32

                  SECTION 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Revolving Loan on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of such
Lender's Tranche A Term Loan on the Tranche A Term Loan Maturity Date and the
unpaid principal amount of such Lender's Tranche B Term Loan on the Tranche B
Term Loan Maturity Date and (iii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Revolving Loan
Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the
15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least three Business Days after
such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Revolving Loan
Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then
outstanding.

                  (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which
it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

                  (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced
by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender
(or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and
in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced
by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

                  SECTION 2.10 Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have
the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or
in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this
Section.

                  (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and,
in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or
portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given
in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the


                                       33
<PAGE>

Revolving Loan Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of
prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance
with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a
Revolving Loan Borrowing or a Term Loan Borrowing, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any
Revolving Loan Borrowing or any Term Loan Borrowing shall be in an amount that
would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Loan Borrowing or a
Term Loan Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as
necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each
prepayment of a Revolving Loan Borrowing or a Term Loan Borrowing shall be
applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments
shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

                  (c) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds
are received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any
Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall, within one Business Day after such Net
Proceeds are received, prepay Term Loan Borrowings in accordance with paragraph
(e) below in an aggregate amount equal to such Net Proceeds; provided that, in
the case of any event described in clause (a) or (b) of the definition of the
term Prepayment Event or in the case of any issuance of Capital Stock by the
Subsidiaries to finance a Permitted Acquisition, if the Borrower shall deliver
to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect
that the Borrower and the Subsidiaries intend to apply the Net Proceeds from
such event or issuance (or a portion thereof specified in such certificate),
within 360 days after receipt of such Net Proceeds, to (i) acquire real
property, equipment or other tangible assets to be used in the business of the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries (or in the case of an event described in clause
(b) of the definition of the term Prepayment Event, to promptly and diligently
apply such Net Proceeds to pay or reimburse the cost of repairing or restoring
or replacing the assets in respect of which such Net Proceeds were received) or
(ii) make Permitted Acquisitions, within 360 days of receipt thereof (other than
Net Proceeds received from business interruption insurance for working capital
and general corporate purposes), and certifying that no Default has occurred and
is continuing, then no prepayment shall be required pursuant to this paragraph
in respect of the Net Proceeds in respect of such event (or the portion of such
Net Proceeds specified in such certificate, if applicable) except to the extent
of any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have not been so applied by the end of
such 360 day period, at which time a prepayment shall be required in an amount
equal to such Net Proceeds that have not been so applied. In addition, in the
event and on each occasion that the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall sell, lease
or otherwise dispose of any asset (whether or not such transaction shall
constitute a Prepayment Event), if the Borrower would be required to prepay or
redeem, or to offer to prepay or redeem, any Subordinated Debt as a result of
such transaction unless the proceeds of such transaction are applied within a
specified period to prepay Term Loan Borrowings (or otherwise reinvested as
permitted in accordance with the terms of such Subordinated Debt), then the
Borrower shall (unless such proceeds are otherwise reinvested within the
specified period in a manner that relieves the Borrower of any such requirement
in respect of the Subordinated Debt) prepay Term Loan Borrowings in accordance
with paragraph (e) below within such specified period to the extent necessary to
relieve the Borrower of any such requirement. In the event the Borrower receives
any such Net Proceeds (not immediately reinvested in accordance with this
Section 2.10(c)) in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year,
the Borrower shall within three Business Days of receipt thereof, deposit such
excess Net Proceeds in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account, pending the
application of such Net Proceeds in accordance with this Section 2.10(c).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, at the Borrower's
option, the Net Proceeds from Specified Asset Sales may be used to prepay
Revolving Loans, provided such amount may only be re-borrowed as Revolving Loans
to make reinvestments or prepayments in accordance with this Section 2.10(c).


                                       34
<PAGE>

                  (d) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower, the
Borrowers shall prepay Term Loan Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to: (i)
50% of Consolidated Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year in accordance with
paragraph (e) below if the Total Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.50
to 1.00 on the last day of such fiscal year or (ii) 25% of Consolidated Excess
Cash Flow for such fiscal year in accordance with paragraph (e) below if the
Total Leverage Ratio is less than 2.50 to 1.00 on the last day of such fiscal
year. Each prepayment pursuant to this paragraph shall be made on or before the
date on which the certificate of the Financial Officer of the Borrower is
delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 with respect to the fiscal year for which
Consolidated Excess Cash Flow is being calculated (and in any event within 90
days after the end of such fiscal year).

                  (e) Prior to any optional prepayment of Borrowings hereunder,
the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall
specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to paragraph
(b) of this Section. In the event of any mandatory prepayment of Term Loan
Borrowings made at a time when Term Loan Borrowings of more than one Class
remain outstanding, the Borrower shall select Term Loan Borrowings to be prepaid
so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment is allocated among the Tranche A
Term Loan Borrowings and the Tranche B Term Loan Borrowings pro rata based on
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Borrowings of each such Class;
provided that any Tranche B Term Loan Lender may elect (so long as amounts are
outstanding under the Tranche A Term Loans), by notice to the Administrative
Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) at least one Business Day prior to
the prepayment date, to decline all or any portion of any prepayment of its
Tranche B Term Loans pursuant to this Section (other than an optional prepayment
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section, which may not be declined), in which
case Borrower may elect to retain up to 50% of the aggregate amount of the
prepayment that would have been applied to prepay Tranche B Term Loans but was
so declined and the balance thereof not retained by Borrower shall be applied to
prepay Tranche A Term Loan Borrowings.

                  (f) If on any day on which Loans would otherwise be required
to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.10, (each a "Prepayment Date"), the
amount of such required prepayment exceeds the then outstanding aggregate
principal amount of ABR Loans which are of the Class required to be prepaid, and
no Default exists or is continuing, then on such Prepayment Date, at any time
following the establishment of the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account
pursuant to Section 8.02, at the election of Borrower, (i) Borrower shall
deposit Dollars into the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account in an amount
equal to such excess, and only the outstanding ABR Loans which are of the Class
required to be prepaid shall be required to be prepaid on such Prepayment Date
and (ii) on the last day of each Interest Period after such Prepayment Date in
effect with respect to a Eurodollar Loan which is of the Class required to be
prepaid, the Administrative Agent is irrevocably authorized and directed to
apply funds from the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account (and liquidate
investments held in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account as necessary) to
prepay such Eurodollar Loans for which the Interest Period is then ending to the
extent funds are available in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account.

                  SECTION 2.11 Amortization of Term Loans. (a) Subject to
adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, the Borrower shall repay
the Tranche A Term Loan on each date set forth below in the aggregate principal
amount equal to the amount of the Tranche A Term Loans set forth opposite such
date:

                  (c) To the extent not previously paid, (i) all Tranche A Term
Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche A Term Loan Maturity Date and (ii)
all Tranche B Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche B Term Loan
Maturity Date.

                  (d) Any prepayment of a Term Loan Borrowing of any Class shall
be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term Loan
Borrowings of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section ratably. If the
initial aggregate amount of the Lenders' Term Loan Commitments of any Class
exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans of such Class that are made
on the Effective Date or the Tranche A Term Loan Borrowing Date as applicable,
then the scheduled repayments of Term Loan Borrowings of such Class to be made
pursuant to this Section shall be reduced ratably by an aggregate amount equal
to such excess.

                  (e) Prior to any repayment of any Term Loan Borrowings of any
Class hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of the
applicable Class to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 12:00 noon.,
New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such
repayment. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans
included in the repaid Borrowing. Repayments of Term Loan Borrowings shall be
accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid.

                  SECTION 2.12 Fees. (a) Borrower agrees to pay to
Administrative Agent, for distribution to each Lender in proportion to that
Lender's Applicable Percentage (i) of the Revolving Loan Commitments (other than
Swingline Loan Commitments), commitment fees for the period from and including
the Effective Date to and excluding the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, equal to
the average of the daily excess of the Revolving Loan Commitments, as then in
effect, over the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit
Exposure multiplied by the applicable Facility Fee Rate and (ii) commitment fees
for the period from and including the Effective Date to and excluding the
earlier of (i) the Tranche A Term Loan Borrowing Date and (ii) the Tranche A
Term Loan Commitment Termination Date, equal to the Tranche A Term Loan
Commitment multiplied by the applicable Facility Fee Rate. Accrued facility fees
shall be payable in arrears on the third business day following the last day of
March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the
Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof; provided that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the
Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

<PAGE>

                  (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving
Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period
from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on
which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender
ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee,
which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount
of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed
LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date
on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's
standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees
and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day
following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the
Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on
which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on
which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees
payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within
10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed
on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                  (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due,
in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be
refundable under any circumstances.

                  SECTION 2.13 Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR
Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable
Rate. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, Swingline Loans
shall bear interest at the Swingline Lender quoted cost of funds plus the
Applicable Rate (Eurodollar Spread) for Tranche B Term Loans; provided, however,
that Swingline Loans shall bear interest at a rate no higher than at the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (ABR Spread) for Revolving Loans.

                  (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the
Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of
any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the
preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2%
plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this
Section.

<PAGE>

                  (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans,
upon termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments; provided that (i) interest
accrued pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.13 shall be payable on
demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than
a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability
Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of
any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.

                  (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate,
Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent,
and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.14 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
applicable, for such Interest Period; or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the any of the
Lenders that the making of Eurodollar Loan (i) has become unlawful as a result
of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental
rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such treaty,
governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law
even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful) or (ii) has
become impracticable, or would cause such Lender material hardship, as a result
of contingencies occurring after the date of this Agreement which materially and
adversely affect the interbank Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender
in that market, then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an "Affected
Lender" and it shall on that day give notice (by facsimile or by telephone
confirmed in writing) to Borrower and Administrative Agent of such determination
(which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other
Lender).

         Thereafter (a) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as,
or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until such notice
shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (b) to the extent such determination
by the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Loan then being requested by
Borrower pursuant to a Borrowing Request or a notice of conversion/continuation,
the Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or convert such Loan to, as the
case may be) a ABR Loan, (c) the Affected Lender's obligation to maintain its
outstanding Eurodollar Loans (the "Affected Loans") shall be terminated at the
earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with
respect to the Affected Loans or when required by law, and (d) the Affected
Loans shall automatically convert into ABR Loans on the date of such
termination.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an
Affected Lender as described above relates to a Eurodollar Loan then being
requested by Borrower pursuant to a Borrowing Request or a notice of
conversion/continuation, Borrower shall have the option to rescind such
Borrowing Request or notice of conversion/continuation as to all Lenders by
giving notice (by facsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to
Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which the Affected


                                       39
<PAGE>

Lender gives and Borrower receives notice of its determination as described
above (which notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit
to each other Lender). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence,
nothing in this subsection (b) shall affect the obligation of any Lender other
than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to,
Eurodollar Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 2.15 Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                           (i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any
                  reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets
                  of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
                  by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected
                  in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

                           (ii)     impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or
                  the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
                  Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any
                  Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to increase the cost to
such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any
Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on
the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters
of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's
or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsections (a)
or (b) of this Section 2.15 and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
calculating the additional amounts owed to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

                  (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing
Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the
Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions
incurred more


                                       40
<PAGE>

than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

                  SECTION 2.16 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked
under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the
assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender
for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to
include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been
applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last
day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender
would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section and setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for calculating the amounts owed shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

                  SECTION 2.17 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account
of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or
Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make
such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor,
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest
and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by


                                       41
<PAGE>

the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank,
or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the
Issuing Bank, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the
additional amounts owed, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate. For any period with respect to
which a Foreign Lender has failed to provide Borrower with the appropriate form,
certificate or other document requested by Borrower, such Foreign Lender shall
not be entitled to indemnification with respect to Taxes by reason of such
failure unless such form is provided within a reasonable time after the end of
such period.

                  (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its
sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to
which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the
Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay
over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with
respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to
the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in
the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to
require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns
(or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to
the Borrower or any other Person.

                  SECTION 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing
of Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC
Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or
otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in
immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly on behalf of the
Persons entitled thereto. Payment to the Administrative Agent other than as
described above shall constitute payment to the Lender. The Administrative Agent
shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of


                                       42
<PAGE>

any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt
thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business
Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be
payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made
in dollars.

                  (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower
or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this
paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to
the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise
against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

                  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

<PAGE>

                  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(d),
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

                  SECTION 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in
the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender, in such Lender's reasonable
judgment, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

                  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and
fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case
of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section
2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment
will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not
be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a
result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the
Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                  SECTION 2.20 Incremental Facility. At any time and from time
to time prior to the Tranche A Term Loan Maturity Date or the Tranche B Term
Loan Maturity Date, the Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent
(which shall promptly delivery a copy to each of the Lenders), request the
addition of a new tranche of term loans (all such Loans, collectively, the
"Incremental Loans"); provided, however, that both at the time of any such
request and at the time of effectiveness of the related Incremental Facility
Amendment (as defined below), (i) no Default shall exist, (ii) the Borrower
shall be in pro forma compliance (giving effect to any Incremental Loans to be
made on or about such date of effectiveness) with the Financial Covenants, to
the extent than applicable and (iii) the making of the Incremental Loans will
not require any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness hereunder) to be secured
by any Collateral, on a pari passu basis or otherwise. The Incremental Loans (i)
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least $10,000,000 and not in
excess of $100,000,000, (ii) shall rank pari passu in right of payment and of
security (including under the Collateral Agreement) with the Loans, (iii) shall
mature no sooner than, and have an average weighted life no shorter than, the
Tranche B Term Loans,


                                       44
<PAGE>

and in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent, (iv) will not amortize
(other than nominal amortization customary in the institutional loan market) on
a basis more favorable than the proportionate amortization of existing Term
Loans and (v) shall otherwise be treated no more favorably than the existing
Term Loans (including with respect to mandatory and voluntary prepayments and
price protection); provided that the terms and conditions applicable to the
Incremental Loans may provide for additional or different financial or other
covenants applicable only during periods after the Tranche A Term Loan Maturity
Date and the Tranche B Term Loan Maturity Date. Such notice shall set forth the
requested amount of Incremental Loans. In the event that existing Lenders
provide commitments in an aggregate amount less than the total amount of the
Incremental Loans requested by the Borrower, the Borrower may arrange for one or
more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or other financial
institution being called an "Additional Lender") to extend commitments to
provide Incremental Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed
amount, provided that each Additional Lender shall be subject to the approval of
the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).
Commitments in respect of Incremental Loans shall become Commitments under this
Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an "Incremental Facility Amendment") to this
Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Loan
Parties, each Lender agreeing to provide such Commitment, if any, each
Additional Lender, if any, and the Administrative Agent. The Incremental
Facility Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such
amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or
appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the
provisions of this Section. The effectiveness of any Incremental Facility
Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof of each of
the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No Lender shall be obligated to
provide any Incremental Loans unless it so agrees.


                                  ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders on the Effective
Date, on the date of each Borrowing and on the date of issuance of each Letter
of Credit, that:

                  SECTION 3.01 Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

                  SECTION 3.02 Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions
are within the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action. Each of this Agreement
and the Security Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower
and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.


                                       45
<PAGE>

                  SECTION 3.03 Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The
Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or
filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority which has not
been or will not be timely obtained, registered or filed, as the case may be,
except (x) as such have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect
or (y) filings necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan Documents, (b)
will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or
other organizational documents of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any
order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default
under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to
require any payment to be made by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and
(d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries other than as anticipated and created
under the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 3.04 Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.
(a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated
balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows as of
and for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2001, reported on by Arthur Andersen
LLP, independent public accountants, certified by its chief financial officer.
Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of such dates and for such periods
in accordance with GAAP.

                  (b) Since December 30, 2001, there has been no adverse change
in the business, assets, operations, prospects or condition, financial or
otherwise, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole which would
have or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.05 Properties. (a) Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has good, marketable fee title to, or valid leasehold interests in,
all its real and personal property material to its business, except for
Permitted Encumbrances and minor defects in title that do not materially
interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to
utilize such properties for their intended purposes.

                  (b) With respect to substantially all of the operating leases
for Real Property Assets (each a "Real Property Lease") pursuant to which the
Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries has a leasehold interest, each of the
following is true except to the extent that, if not true, the consequences of
same would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect:

                           (i)      such Real Property Leases are in full force
                  and effect;

                           (ii)     to the best knowledge of Borrower, all rent,
                  additional rent and/or other charges reserved in or payable by
                  Borrower or its applicable Subsidiary, as tenant, under the
                  Real Property Leases, have been paid to the extent that they
                  have been determined and are payable to the date hereof and
                  are not being contested in good faith by Borrower, any such
                  amounts being contested have been paid or rescinded for by
                  Borrower or its applicable Subsidiary, and no such contest may
                  reasonably be expected to result in the exercise by the
                  applicable landlord of a remedy of termination of such Real
                  Property Lease;

                           (iii)    to the actual knowledge of Borrower, no
                  Person has questioned Borrower's or its applicable
                  Subsidiary's quiet and peaceful possession of the premises
                  which are the subject of such Real Property Lease;


                                       46
<PAGE>

                           (iv)     no default by Borrower or its applicable
                  Subsidiary, as tenant, under any of the material terms of any
                  Real Property Lease has occurred and remains uncured; nor, to
                  the best knowledge of Borrower, is there any existing
                  condition which, with the passage of time or the giving of
                  notice, or both, would result in a default by Borrower or its
                  applicable Subsidiary under the terms of any Real Property
                  Lease;

                           (v)      Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall,
                  or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, other than in the
                  ordinary course of business and if such action would not
                  reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
                  Effect,: (A) promptly and faithfully observe, perform and
                  comply with all the material terms, covenants and provisions
                  of each Real Property Lease on its part to be observed,
                  performed and complied with, within the applicable grace
                  periods, if any; (B) refrain from doing anything, as a result
                  of which, there could be a material default under or a breach
                  of any of the terms of any Real Property Lease; (C) not do,
                  permit or suffer any event or omission as a result of which
                  there would occur a default or breach under any Real Property
                  Lease after the passing of the applicable grace periods, if
                  any; (D) not cancel, terminate, surrender, modify, amend or in
                  any way alter or permit the alteration of any of the
                  provisions of any Real Property Lease or grant any material
                  consents or waivers thereunder; and not exercise any right it
                  may have under any Real Property Lease to cancel or surrender
                  the same without the prior written consent of the
                  Administrative Agent, such consent not to be unreasonably
                  withheld, conditioned or delayed; and (E) give the
                  Administrative Agent any notice of any default under any
                  "Material Real Property Leases" received or sent by Borrower
                  or its applicable Subsidiary, within three (3) Business Days
                  and promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent a copy of all
                  responses to default notices, similar instruments received or
                  delivered by Borrower or its applicable Subsidiary, in
                  connection with any Material Real Property Leases. As used
                  herein, "Material Real Property Lease" means the office lease
                  for Borrower's headquarters at Six Concourse Parkway, Atlanta,
                  Georgia and any other lease the Borrower or its Subsidiaries
                  may enter into with an aggregate value of rental payments
                  exceeding $100,000 in any 12 month period.

                  (c) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other
Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (d) The properties listed on Schedule 1.1A are all of
Borrower's existing fee owned real property assets in Texas, Arizona,
Mississippi, New Mexico, Missouri and California as of the Effective Date.

                  SECTION 3.06 Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There
are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve this
Agreement or the Transactions.


                                       47
<PAGE>

                  (b) Except for with respect to any matters that, individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed
to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any
permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has
become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any
claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for
any Environmental Liability.

                  SECTION 3.07 Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and
orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all
indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No material
default has occurred and is continuing with respect to any of the aforementioned
in this Section 3.07.

                  SECTION 3.08 Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither
the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as
defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940
or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

                  SECTION 3.09 Taxes. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to
have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have
been paid by it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent
that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.10 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used
for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as
of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts,
exceed the fair market value of the assets of such Plan.

                  SECTION 3.11 Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the
Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which
it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it,
that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any of the
other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished
by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading in any material respect; provided that, with respect
to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such
information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable at the time.

                  SECTION 3.12 Licenses, etc. The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries have obtained and hold in full force and effect, all franchises,
licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations,


                                       48
<PAGE>


qualifications, accreditations, easements, rights of way and other rights,
consents and approvals which are necessary for the operation of their respective
businesses as presently conducted, except where the failure to obtain and hold
the same, individually or in the aggregate, may not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.13 Labor Matters. As of the Effective Date, there
are no strikes, lockouts, slowdowns or any other material labor disputes against
the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or threatened. All payments due from the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare
insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the
books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions
will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on the
part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the
Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.

                  SECTION 3.14 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. All proceeds
of each Loan, and each Letter of Credit, will be used by the Borrower only in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.08. No part of the proceeds of any
Loan will be used by the Borrower to purchase or carry any Margin Stock or to
extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin
Stock. Neither the making of any Loan nor the use of the proceeds thereof will
violate or be inconsistent with the provisions of Regulations U or X.

                  SECTION 3.15 Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.15 sets forth the name
of, and the ownership interest of the Borrower in, each Subsidiary of the
Borrower and identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in each

Administrative Agent, may reasonably request.

                  SECTION 5.02 Notices of Material Events. The Borrower will
furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender prompt written notice of the
following:

                  (a) the occurrence of any Default;

                  (b) the filing or commencement of any action, suit or

development that results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
Material Adverse Effect.

Each notice delivered under this Section shall be accompanied by a statement of

or proposed to be taken with respect thereto.

                  SECTION 5.03 Existence; Conduct of Business. The Borrower
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its legal

its business; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger,
consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted under Section 6.03.

                  SECTION 5.04 Payment of Obligations. The Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay its obligations, including Tax

faith, (b) the Borrower or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate
reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP and (c) the failure to

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 5.06 Books and Records; Inspection Rights. The
Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep proper books of
record and account in accordance with sound business practices sufficient to
permit the preparation of financial statements auditable in accordance with

cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, upon reasonable prior notice, to visit and
inspect its properties, to examine and make extracts from its books and records,
and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition with its officers and
independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as reasonably

during any such examinations and conferences.

                  SECTION 5.07 Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations and
orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property, except
where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 5.08 Use of Proceeds and Letters of Credit. The
proceeds of the Tranche B Term Loan and the Revolving Loan will be used only for
(i) the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement
and (ii) to the extent of the excess, for general corporate purposes (including,
without limitation, payment of fees, expenses, and other transaction costs
contemplated hereunder). The proceeds of the Tranche A Term Loan will be used
(i) to repurchase in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture the
Senior Subordinated Notes (including any accrued interest on the date of such
repurchase) at the stated call price calculated in accordance with the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture and (ii) to the extent of the excess, for general
corporate purposes. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether
directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any of the
Regulations of the Board, including Regulations T, U and X.

                  SECTION 5.09 Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies (a) insurance in such amounts (with no greater risk retention) and
against such risks as are customarily maintained by companies of established
repute engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or
similar locations including, without limitation, appropriate environmental
liability insurance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in any
case no less favorable than that which the Borrower has in place on the
Effective Date, to a date not less than six months following the Tranche B Term
Loan Maturity Date and (b) all insurance required to be maintained pursuant to
the Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Borrower will maintain or cause to be maintained flood insurance with respect to
each Flood Hazard Property that is located in a community that participates in
the National Flood Insurance Program, in each case in compliance with any
applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
The Borrower will furnish to the Lenders, upon request of the Administrative
Agent, information in reasonable detail as to the insurance so maintained.

                  SECTION 5.10 Information Regarding Collateral. (a) The
Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent prompt written notice of any
changes as required by the Collateral Agreement (i) in any Loan Party's
corporate name or in any trade name used to identify it in the conduct of its
business or in the ownership of its properties, (ii) in the location of any Loan
Party's chief executive office, its principal place of business, any office in
which it maintains books or records relating to Collateral owned by it or any
office or facility at which Collateral owned by it is located (including the
establishment of any such new office or facility), (iii) in any Loan Party's
identity, jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, or corporate or
organizational structure or (iv) in any Loan Party's Organization Identification
Number. The Borrower agrees not to effect or permit any change referred to in
the


                                       55
<PAGE>

preceding sentence unless all filings have been made under the Uniform
Commercial Code or otherwise that are required in order for the Administrative
Agent to continue at all times following such change to have a valid, legal and
perfected security interest in all the Collateral. The Borrower also agrees
promptly to notify the Administrative Agent if any material portion of the
Collateral is damaged or destroyed.

                  (b) Each year, at the time of delivery of annual financial
statements with respect to the preceding fiscal year pursuant to clause (a) of
Section 5.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a
certificate of a Financial Officer of the Borrower setting forth the information
required pursuant to the Perfection Certificate or confirming that there has
been no change in such information since the date of the Perfection Certificate
delivered on the Effective Date or the date of the most recent certificate
delivered pursuant to this Section.

                  SECTION 5.11 Additional Subsidiaries and Real Property Assets.
(a) If any additional Subsidiary is formed or acquired after the Effective Date,
the Borrower will notify the Administrative Agent thereof and, within ten
Business Days (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent may permit in
light of the circumstances) after such Subsidiary is formed or acquired, cause
the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement to be satisfied with respect to such
Subsidiary (if it is a Subsidiary Loan Party) and to any Equity Interest in or
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary owned by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the
extent required by the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement. The Borrower shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to have domestic
Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Loan Parties comply with the Collateral and
Guarantee Requirement, including, without limitation, having third party
stockholders of any such Subsidiary provide any necessary consents to such
compliance.

                  (b) With respect to any Real Property Asset that individually
has a book value upon acquisition in excess of $250,000, and upon the aggregate
book value of properties acquired exceeding $5,000,000 any Real Property Asset
that individually has a book value upon acquisition in excess of $100,000, to be
acquired by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Date (each
an "Acquisition Property" and collectively, the "Acquisition Properties")
Borrower shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) not less than ten (10)
Business days after the acquisition thereof, notify Administrative Agent in
writing of such acquisition; (ii) not later than five days after a Mortgage is
delivered to Borrower, execute and deliver the Mortgage to Administrative Agent
(each an "Additional Mortgage" and collectively the "Additional Mortgages") duly
executed by the Borrower or applicable Subsidiary together with evidence that
such Additional Mortgage has been recorded in all places to the extent necessary
or desirable, in the reasonable judgment of Administrative Agent, so as to
effectively create a valid and enforceable first priority lien, subject to
Permitted Encumbrances, on such Acquisition Property in favor of Administrative
Agent (or such other trustee as may be required or desired under local law) for
the benefit of Lenders; (iii) not later than the date on which such Mortgage is
delivered, have delivered to Administrative Agent a title report in respect of
any such Acquisition Property; (iv) if such Acquisition Property is to be held
by Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries as a leasehold interest, exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Administrative Agent
(x) the consent of the lessor thereof to the encumbering by Borrower or the
applicable Subsidiary of its leasehold interest as a condition to Borrower's
obligation to deliver an Additional Mortgage and (y) upon the request of
Administrative Agent, deliver to Administrative Agent an estoppel letter from
the landlord, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative
Agent, environmental audits prepared by nationally recognized professional
consultants or other consultants mutually acceptable to Borrower and
Administrative Agent, in form, scope and substance satisfactory to
Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties shall
not be obligated to comply with this Section 5.11 with respect to Real Property
Assets


                                       56
<PAGE>

(other than Acquisition Properties subject to an Additional Mortgage) that (i)
are leasehold properties and have a book value upon acquisition of less than
$300,000 or (ii) are subject to a turnkey development contract whereupon
Borrower is obligated to convey the subject property to a franchisee within
twelve months of the date of Borrower's acquisition (a "Turnkey Property");
provided in each case that Borrower's Total Leverage Ratio does not exceed 3.0
to 1.0 for the most recently ended fiscal quarter. In the event that Borrower's
Total Leverage Ratio exceeds 3.0 to 1.0 at any date of determination, then the
Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties shall be obligated to comply with this
Section 5.11 with respect to Real Property Assets (other than leasehold
properties that have a book value upon acquisition of less than $300,000 or a
Turnkey Property). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, if a Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower and its
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to comply with this Section 5.11 with respect to
all Real Property Assets within 60 days of receipt of notice of such Default
from the Administrative Agent. The Borrower will, no less than once during each
six month period, provide the Administrative Agent with a list of real property
acquired by Borrower and its Subsidiaries since the date of the last list
provided pursuant to this Section 5.11.

                  (c) If Borrower or any Subsidiary is required to deliver an
Additional Mortgage with respect to any Acquisition Property, Borrower shall
deliver or shall cause such subsidiary to deliver to Administrative Agent, and
promptly thereafter evidence that such Additional Mortgage has been recorded in
all places to the extent necessary or desirable, in the reasonable judgment of
Administrative Agent, so as to effectively create a valid and enforceable first
priority lien, subject to Permitted Encumbrances, on such Acquisition Property
in favor of Administrative Agent (or such other trustee as may be required or
desired under local law) for the benefit of Lenders; an ALTA mortgage title
insurance policy if available in the jurisdiction in which the Acquisition
Property is located (each an "Additional Mortgagee Policy" and collectively, the
"Additional Mortgagee Policies") issued by the Title Company, in an amount
reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent (but not in excess of
Administrative Agent's reasonable determination of the fair market value of the
Acquisition Property), assuring Administrative Agent that the Additional
Mortgage in connection with the acquisition thereof creates a valid and
enforceable first priority mortgage lien on such Acquisition Property, free and
clear of all defects and encumbrances except Permitted Encumbrances, and subject
to a standard survey exception, and which Additional Mortgagee Policy shall
provide for affirmative insurance and such reinsurance as Administrative Agent
may reasonably request, all of the foregoing in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent. If any Real Property Asset of Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries is to be leased or subleased by the Borrower or
applicable Subsidiary to a non-Affiliate of Borrower, Administrative Agent
agrees to deliver, on behalf of itself and all Lenders an agreement of
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit E (subject to such necessary modifications to comply with the
laws of the applicable jurisdiction in which it will be filed), subordinating
the leasehold interest of such third party to the Additional Mortgage and the
Lien created thereby, which agreement shall be executed by Borrower or the
applicable Subsidiary as lessor (or sublessor, as the case may be) and the
lessee (or sublessee, as the case may be).

                  (d) If no Default has occurred and is continuing and Borrower
or any Subsidiary Loan Party sells any Mortgaged Property or Acquisition
Property to a franchisee or non-Affiliate of Borrower in connection with the
sale of the land and/or improvements (building, furniture, fixtures and
equipment) thereon to such franchisee or non-Affiliate of Borrower, then
Administrative Agent shall deliver a release of the Mortgage or Additional
Mortgage to Borrower's counsel or to the relevant Title Company, to be held in
trust pending the closing of any such sale.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrative
Agent may in its sole discretion exclude particular Real Property Assets from
the Collateral if it determines that the cost or


                                       57
<PAGE>

impracticality of including such assets would be excessive or disproportionate
in relation to (i) the benefits to the Lenders and (ii) the value of such Real
Property Asset.

                  SECTION 5.12 Compliance with Contractual Obligations. The
Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply in all
material respects with its obligations under each agreement to which it is a
party and enforce its rights thereunder in a commercially reasonable manner, to
the extent a failure to do so could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 5.13 Further Assurances. (a) The Borrower will, and
will cause each Subsidiary Loan Party to, execute any and all further documents,
financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further
actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture
filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other documents), which may be required
under any applicable law, or which the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders may reasonably request, to cause the Collateral and Guarantee
Requirement to be and remain satisfied, all at the expense of the Loan Parties.
The Borrower also agrees to provide to the Administrative Agent, from time to
time upon request, evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
as to the perfection and priority of the Liens created or intended to be created
by the Security Documents.

                  (b) If any material assets other than Real Property Assets
addressed in Section 5.11 are acquired by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan
Party after the Effective Date (other than assets constituting Collateral under
the Collateral Agreement that become subject to the Lien of the Collateral
Agreement upon acquisition thereof), the Borrower will notify the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders thereof, and, if requested by the Administrative Agent or
the Required Lenders, the Borrower will cause such assets to be subjected to a
Lien securing the Obligations and will take, and cause the Subsidiary Loan
Parties to take, such actions as shall be necessary or reasonably requested by
the Administrative Agent to grant and perfect such Liens, including actions
described in paragraph (a) of this Section, all at the expense of the Loan
Parties.

                  SECTION 5.14 Casualty and Condemnation. The Borrower (a) will
furnish to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders prompt written notice of any
casualty or other insured damage to any material portion of any Collateral or
the commencement of any action or proceeding for the taking of any Collateral or
any part thereof or interest therein under power of eminent domain or by
condemnation or similar proceeding and (b) will ensure that the Net Proceeds of
any such event (whether in the form of insurance proceeds, condemnation awards
or otherwise) are collected and applied in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Security Documents; provided, however, so long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred or be continuing, Borrower or its Subsidiaries may
retain and apply such Net Proceeds in accordance with the provision of Section
2.10(c).

                  SECTION 5.15 End of Fiscal Years; Fiscal Quarters. The
Borrower will, for financial reporting purposes, cause each of its fiscal years
and quarters to end on the dates shown on the period calendar attached hereto as
Schedule 5.15.

Indebtedness represented by the Senior Subordinated Notes shall be repaid in
full by no later than the Tranche A Term Loan Commitment Termination Date;
provided that with respect to future Subordinated Debt, at the time of the
incurrence of such Indebtedness and after giving effect thereto the Total
Leverage Ratio shall be no greater than the applicable ratio provided for in

                  SECTION 6.02 Liens. The Borrower will not, and will not permit
any Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or permit to exist any Lien on any

<PAGE>

                  (b) any Lien (other than Permitted Encumbrances) on any

is not created in contemplation of or in connection with such acquisition or
such Person becoming a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (ii) such Lien shall not
apply to any other property or assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary and
(iii) such Lien shall secure only those obligations which it secures on the date

with Permitted Joint Venture Investments.

                  SECTION 6.03 Fundamental Changes and Asset Sales. (a) The
Borrower will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, merge into or

consolidate with it, or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of (in one
transaction or in a series of transactions) all or substantially all of its
assets, or all or substantially all of the stock of any of the Subsidiary Loan
Parties (in each case, whether now owned or hereafter acquired), or liquidate or
dissolve, except that, if at the time thereof and immediately after giving
effect thereto no Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be
continuing (i) any Subsidiary may merge into the Borrower in a transaction in
which the Borrower is the surviving corporation, (ii) any Subsidiary may merge
into any Subsidiary in a transaction in which the surviving entity is a
Subsidiary; provided that to the extent either such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary
Loan Party, the surviving entity shall be a Subsidiary Loan Party, (iii) any
Subsidiary may sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its assets to the
Borrower or to another Subsidiary, (iv) any Subsidiary may liquidate or dissolve
if the Borrower determines in good faith that such liquidation or dissolution is
in the best interests of the Borrower and is not materially disadvantageous to
the Lenders; provided that any such merger involving a Person that is not a
wholly owned Subsidiary immediately prior to such merger shall not be permitted
unless also permitted by Section 6.04, (v) Borrower and its Subsidiaries may
sell or otherwise dispose of assets in transactions that do not constitute Asset
Sales; provided that the consideration received for such assets shall be in
amount at least equal to the fair market value thereof, (vi) Borrower or its
Subsidiaries may make Specified Asset Sales provided that, such Specified Asset
Sales can be made for Cash or non-Cash consideration until the amount of
non-Cash consideration exceeds $10,000,000 in the aggregate; thereafter, such
Specified Asset Sales shall be made for at least 66 2/3% in Cash (provided that
the limitation with respect to Cash consideration set forth in this Section
6.03(vi) shall not apply to the asset sales described under clause (iv) of the
definition of Specified Asset Sales), (vii) Borrower or its Subsidiaries may
take any action permitted by Section 6.04 below to the extent constituting an
Asset Sale, (viii) subject to Section 6.16, Borrower and its Subsidiaries may

the consideration received for each such Asset Sale shall be in an amount at
least equal to the fair market value thereof; (B) the consideration for each
such Asset Sale is at least 66 2/3% in Cash and (C) the proceeds of such Asset
Sales shall be applied as required by Section 2.10(c), and (ix) Borrower may
reorganize for the purpose of changing its jurisdiction of incorporation to the
State of Delaware or the State of Georgia;


                                       61
<PAGE>

         (b) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, engage to any material extent in any business other than businesses of the
type conducted by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on the date of execution of
this Agreement and businesses reasonably related thereto and that will not
materially change its or its Subsidiary's material lines of business taken as a
whole as of the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the type of business
conducted by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date is the
franchising of food-service related businesses and the provision of directly
related services and products and the distribution, wholesale and retailing of
food and food related products.

                  SECTION 6.04 Investments, Loans, Advances, Guarantees and
Acquisitions. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, purchase, hold or acquire (including pursuant to any merger with any Person
that was not a wholly owned Subsidiary prior to such merger) any Investment,
except:

                  (a) Permitted Investments;

                  (b) (i) Investments by the Borrower existing on the date
hereof in the capital stock of its Subsidiaries and future investments in its
Subsidiaries which are not Subsidiary Loan Parties, (ii) Permitted Joint Venture
Investments, (iii) Investments for acquisitions by Subsidiaries (other than
Subsidiary Loan Parties) and (iv) Investments by Subsidiaries in capital
expenditures, all of which in the aggregate shall not exceed initially
$40,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 and such limit shall increase by $10,000,000 per
annum; provided, however, that if at the time of making such Investment and
after giving effect thereto the Total Leverage Ratio of Borrower exceeds 2.50 to
1.00, such Investments may be made only to the extent that the total amount
thereof does not at the time of incurrence, when aggregated with other
Investments permitted under Section 6.04(f) and restricted payments permitted
under Section 6.06(a)(iii), exceed $100,000,000; and provided further, if the
Total Leverage Ratio exceeds 2.50 to 1.00 and the aggregate amounts permitted
under Section 6.04(b), Section 6.04(f) and Section 6.06(a)(iii) exceed
$100,000,000, then Permitted Joint Venture Investments, together with
Investments permitted under Section 6.04(f), may be made in an aggregate amount
up to $10,000,000 for each fiscal year, but Permitted Joint Venture Investments
shall remain subject in any event to the $40,000,000 (or greater, depending on
the fiscal year of the Borrower) limitation.

                  (c) Investments consisting of extensions of credit to
franchisees as permitted by Section 6.01 or which otherwise provide credit
support to franchisees in respect of the deferral of royalty payments, rental
payments, taxes, equipment sales, financing of restaurant properties, franchise
agreements and development or territory agreements of such franchisees which
together with Indebtedness permitted under Section 6.01(d) shall not exceed
$100,000,000 in the aggregate;

                  (d) Guarantees constituting Indebtedness permitted by Section
6.01;

                  (e) Permitted Acquisitions either (i) the aggregate cash
consideration paid with respect to which in any twelve month period shall not
exceed $150,000,000 without the prior written consent of Required Lenders or
(ii) to the extent made in consideration of the issuance of Capital Stock of the
Borrower or with the proceeds of the issuance of Capital Stock of the Borrower
(which proceeds are not required to be used to prepay the Loans pursuant to
Section 2.10(c));

                  (f) other Investments not addressed above, in an amount not to
exceed $25,000,000 in the aggregate; provided however, that if at the time of
making such Investment and after giving effect thereto the Total Leverage Ratio
of Borrower exceeds 2.50 to 1.00, such Investments may be made only


                                       62
<PAGE>

to the extent that the total amount thereof does not at the time of incurrence,
when aggregated with other Investments permitted under Section 6.04(b) and
restricted payments permitted under Section 6.06(a)(iii), exceed $100,000,000;
and provided further, if the Total Leverage Ratio exceeds 2.50 to 1.00 and the
aggregate amounts permitted under Section 6.04(b), Section 6.04(f) and Section
6.06(a)(iii) exceed $100,000,000, then Investments permitted under Section
6.04(f), together with Permitted Joint Venture Investments, may be made in an
aggregate amount up to $10,000,000 for each fiscal year, but Investments
permitted under this Section 6.04(f) shall remain subject in any event to the
$25,000,000 limitation; and

                  (g) any matter permitted in Section 6.03 to the extent it is
an Investment.

                  SECTION 6.05 Swap Agreements. The Borrower will not, and will
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any Swap Agreement, except (a)
Swap Agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to hedge or
mitigate risks with respect to commodities or currencies to which the Borrower
or any Subsidiary has actual exposure (other than those in respect of Equity
Interests of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries), and (b) Swap Agreements
entered into in order to effectively cap, collar or exchange interest rates
(from fixed to floating rates, from one floating rate to another floating rate,
from floating to fixed rate or otherwise) with respect to any interest-bearing
liability or investment of the Borrower or any Subsidiary; provided, that in the
event that the Total Leverage Ratio exceeds 3.0 to 1.0 at any date of
determination, then if on such date less than 30% of the funded Indebtedness of
Borrower as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower for the
most recent ended fiscal quarter accrues interest at a fixed rate of interest,
the Borrower shall promptly enter into Swap Agreements, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, to the extent necessary so
that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have consolidated floating rate interest
exposure in respect of not more than 70% of its consolidated funded
Indebtedness.

                  SECTION 6.06 Restricted Payments. (a) The Borrower will not,
and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, declare or make, or agree to pay
or make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment, except (i) the Borrower
may declare and pay dividends with respect to its Equity Interests payable
solely in additional shares of its common stock, (ii) Subsidiaries may declare
and pay dividends ratably with respect to their Equity Interests, (iii) the
Borrower MAY, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, make payments to purchase Borrower Common Stock or options,
warrants or rights to purchase or acquire Borrower Common Stock, in all cases
not to exceed $100,000,000 in aggregate; provided however, that if at the time
of making such payment and after giving effect thereto the Total Leverage Ratio
of Borrower exceeds 2.50 to 1.00, such payment may be made only to the extent
that the total amount thereof does not at the time of payment, when aggregated
with Investments permitted under Sections 6.04(b) and 6.04(f) exceed
$100,000,000 and (iv) after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the
Borrower is in compliance with the Financial Covenants.

                  (b) The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary
to, make or agree to pay or make, directly or indirectly, any payment or other
distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) of or in respect of
principal of or interest on any subordinated Indebtedness, or any payment or
other distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property), including
any sinking fund or similar deposit, on account of the purchase, redemption,
retirement, acquisition, cancellation or termination of any Indebtedness, except
(i) payment or prepayment of Indebtedness created or permitted under the Loan
Documents (including the retirement of the Senior Subordinated Notes) and (ii)
the scheduled interest payments on Subordinated Debt permitted pursuant to this
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof and only to the extent required
thereby; provided that at the time of any payment of such restricted payment
pursuant to this clause (ii) and immediately after giving effect thereto, (A) no
Event of


                                       63
<PAGE>

Default shall have occurred and be continuing under Section 7(a), or (B) no
Event of Default shall have occurred under Section 7(e) and Section 7(f),
provided further that before prohibiting payment for such Event of Default under
Section 7(e) and Section 7(f), Administrative Agent shall have given the notice
required under the Subordinated Debt indenture of its election to block such
payments, subject to the subordination provisions of the permitted Subordinated
Debt.

                  SECTION 6.07 Transactions with Affiliates. The Borrower will
not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, sell, lease or otherwise
transfer any property or assets to, or purchase, lease or otherwise acquire any
property or assets from, or otherwise engage in any other transactions with, any
of its Affiliates, except (a) in the ordinary course of business at prices and
on terms and conditions not less favorable to the Borrower or such Subsidiary
than could be obtained on an arm's-length basis from unrelated third parties,
(b) transactions between or among the Borrower and its wholly owned Subsidiaries
or between wholly owned Subsidiaries not involving any other non-Affiliate and
between Borrower and other non-wholly owned Subsidiaries on a commercially
reasonable basis, (c) any Restricted Payment permitted by Section 6.06, (d)
reasonable and customary compensation or employee benefit arrangements with any
officer or member of the Board of Directors of Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practices, (e) the Employee Tax Loan Notes, and (f) employee stock purchase
plans.

                  SECTION 6.08 Restrictive Agreements. The Borrower will not,
will not permit Subsidiary Loan Parties to and will use reasonable commercial
efforts to prohibit any of its Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Loan Parties
to, directly or indirectly, enter into, incur or permit to exist any agreement
or other arrangement that prohibits, restricts or imposes any condition upon (a)
the ability of the Borrower or any Subsidiary to create, incur or permit to
exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets, or (b) the ability of any
Subsidiary to pay dividends or other distributions with respect to any shares of
its Capital Stock or to make or repay loans or advances to the Borrower or any
other Subsidiary or to Guarantee Indebtedness of the Borrower or any other
Subsidiary; provided that (i) the foregoing shall not apply to restrictions and
conditions imposed by law or by this Agreement, (ii) the foregoing shall not
apply to restrictions and conditions existing on the date hereof identified on
Schedule 6.08 (but shall apply to any extension or renewal of, or any amendment
or modification expanding the scope of, any such restriction or condition),
(iii) the foregoing shall not apply to customary restrictions and conditions
contained in agreements relating to the sale of a Subsidiary pending such sale,
provided such restrictions and conditions apply only to the Subsidiary that is
to be sold and such sale is permitted hereunder, (iv) clause (a) of the
foregoing shall not apply to restrictions or conditions imposed by any agreement
relating to secured Indebtedness permitted by this Agreement if such
restrictions or conditions apply only to the property or assets securing such
Indebtedness and are no more restrictive in any material respect than these
provisions and (v) clause (a) of the foregoing shall not apply to customary
provisions in contracts and leases entered into in the ordinary course
restricting the assignment thereof.

                  SECTION 6.09 Sale and Leaseback Transactions. The Borrower
will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any
arrangement (other than with or between Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries),

personal, used or useful in its business, whether now owned or hereinafter
acquired, and thereafter rent or lease such property or other property that it
intends to use for substantially the same purpose or purposes as the property
sold or transferred, except for Permitted Sale Leasebacks and other sale
leasebacks to the extent such other sale leasebacks and other Indebtedness
permitted under Section 6.01(q) do not exceed $30,000,000 and in no event shall
such other sale leasebacks exceed $15,000,000 in the aggregate, it being
understood that any such Permitted Sale Leaseback or other sale leaseback shall
constitute a Prepayment Event.

permit the aggregate amount of Consolidated Capital Expenditures made by the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries in any fiscal year to exceed the corresponding
amount set forth in the chart below opposite such fiscal year; provided that
with respect to the "Maximum Consolidated Capital Expenditures Amount" shown
below for any fiscal year or period, at Borrower's option such amount may be
increased (i) by 100% of the Maximum Consolidated Capital Expenditure amount for
the immediately preceding fiscal year which was not utilized during such
preceding fiscal year, and (ii) a portion (not to exceed 15%) of the amount of
Maximum Consolidated Capital Expenditures Amount for the immediately succeeding
year (which, to the extent of such increase shall reduce the amount of the
Maximum Consolidated Capital Expenditure Amount for such succeeding year),
provided that in no event shall the aggregate amount of the increases to the
Maximum Consolidated Capital Expenditures Amount pursuant to the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) in any fiscal year or period exceed $15,000,000; provided
further that the Maximum Consolidated Capital Expenditures Amount for each
fiscal year set forth below shall be increased by the amount of Consolidated

will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary Loan Party to, amend, modify or
waive any of its rights under (a) its certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
other organizational documents if such amendment, modification or waiver would
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Lenders or (b) any
indenture, credit agreement or other document entered into to evidence or govern
the terms of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(h) (other than
repayment of the Senior Subordinated Notes) if the effect of such amendment,
modification or waiver is to increase the interest rate on the Indebtedness,
change (to earlier dates) any dates upon which payments of principal or interest
are due thereon, change any event of default or condition to an event of default
(other than to delay, waive or eliminate any such event of default), change the
redemption, prepayment or defeasance provisions thereof, change the
subordination provisions thereof (or of any guaranty thereof), or if the effect
of such amendment or change, together with all other amendments or changes made,
is to increase materially the obligations of the obligor thereunder or to confer
any additional rights on the holders of the Indebtedness (or a trustee or other
representative on their behalf) which would be adverse to Borrower or Lenders.

                  SECTION 6.12 Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. As of the

                  With respect to any period during which a Permitted
Acquisition or an Asset Sale has occurred (each, a "Subject Transaction"), for
purposes of determining compliance with the Financial Covenants (but not for
purposes of determining the Applicable Rate), Consolidated EBITDA-Consolidated
EBITDAR and the components of Consolidated Fixed Charges shall be calculated
with respect to such period on a pro forma basis (including pro forma
adjustments arising out of events which are directly attributable to a specific
transaction, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing
impact, in each case determined on a basis consistent with Article 11 of
Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act and as interpreted by the
staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would include cost
savings resulting from head count reduction, closure of facilities and similar
restructuring charges, which pro forma adjustments shall be certified by the
chief financial officer of Borrower) using the historical audited financial
statements of any business so acquired or to be acquired or sold or to be sold
and the consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
which shall be reformulated as if such Subject Transaction, and any Indebtedness
incurred or repaid in connection therewith, had been consummated or incurred or
repaid at the beginning of such period (and assuming that such Indebtedness
bears interest during any portion of the applicable measurement period prior to
the relevant acquisition at the weighted average of the interest rates
applicable to outstanding Loans incurred during such period).

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
for purposes of calculating compliance with the financial covenants set forth in
Sections 6.14 and 6.15 hereof, up to $25,000,000 of Borrower's guarantees of its
franchisees that are part of the Borrower's multi-borrower franchisee loan
program shall not constitute Indebtedness at any date of determination to the
extent such guarantees are (i) permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(d) of this
Agreement and (ii) are not otherwise reflected as Indebtedness on Borrower's
consolidated balance sheet prepared as of the most recently end fiscal quarter
in accordance with GAAP.

                  SECTION 6.16 Disposal of Subsidiary Stock. Except for any sale
of any Regulatory Shares or all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary owned by
the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, in each case in compliance with the provisions
of Section 6.03 hereof, Borrower shall not directly or indirectly sell, assign,
pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of any shares of Capital Stock or other
equity securities of any of its Subsidiaries, except to qualify directors if
required by applicable law; or permit any of its Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of any
shares of Capital Stock or other equity securities of any of its Subsidiaries
(including such Subsidiary), except to Borrower, a Subsidiary Loan Party, or to
qualify directors if required by applicable law.

                                Events of Default

         If any of the following events ("Events of Default") shall occur:

                  (a) the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan
or any reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement when and as
the same shall become due and payable, whether at the due date thereof or at a
date fixed for prepayment thereof or otherwise;

                  (b) the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or
any fee or any other amount (other than an amount referred to in clause (a) of
this Article) payable under this Agreement, when and as the same shall become
due and payable, and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of
three Business Days;

                  (c) the Borrower shall fail to pay and retire the Senior
Subordinated Notes by the Tranche A Term Loan Commitment Termination Date;

                  (d) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by or
on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in or in connection with this
Agreement or any amendment or modification hereof or waiver hereunder, or in any
report, certificate, financial statement or other document furnished pursuant to
or in connection with this Agreement or any amendment or modification hereof or
waiver hereunder, shall prove to have been materially incorrect when made or
deemed made;

                  (e) the Borrower shall fail to observe or perform any
covenant, condition or agreement contained in Section 5.02, 5.03 (with respect
to the Borrower's existence), 5.08 or in Article VI or in paragraph (e) of the
Collateral and Guarantee Requirement;

                  (f) the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party shall fail to
observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this
Agreement (other than those specified in clause (a), (b), (d) or (e) of this
Article) or in any of the Security Documents (other than with respect to
Collateral with an aggregate fair market value of which does not exceed
$1,000,000), and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of thirty
days after notice thereof from the Administrative Agent to the Borrower (which
notice will be given at the request of any Lender);

                  (g) the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall fail to make any
payment (whether of principal or interest and regardless of amount) in respect
of any Material Indebtedness, when and as the same shall become due and payable
and such failure continues beyond applicable cure periods;

                  (h) any event or condition occurs that results in any Material
Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that enables or
permits (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both) the
holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness or any trustee or agent on its or
their behalf to cause any Material Indebtedness to become due, or to require the
prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its scheduled
maturity; provided that this clause (h) shall not apply to secured Indebtedness
that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale or transfer of the property
or assets securing such Indebtedness;

                  (i) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an
involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation, reorganization or
other relief in respect of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or


                                       68
<PAGE>

its debts, or of a substantial part of its assets, under any Federal, state or
foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in
effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator,
conservator or similar official for the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary or
for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any such case, such proceeding or
petition shall continue undismissed for 60 days or an order or decree approving
or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered;

                  (j) the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary shall (i)
voluntarily commence any proceeding or file any petition seeking liquidation,
reorganization or other relief under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, (ii) consent
to the institution of, or fail to contest in a timely and appropriate manner,
any proceeding or petition described in clause (i) of this Article, (iii) apply
for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian,
sequestrator, conservator or similar official for the Borrower or any Material
Subsidiary or for a substantial part of its assets, (iv) file an answer
admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against it in any such
proceeding, (v) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or (vi)
take any action for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing;

                  (k) the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary shall become
unable, admit in writing its inability or fail generally to pay its debts as
they become due;

                  (l) any money judgments, writ or warrant of attachment or
similar process which is beyond all rights of appeal involving (i) in any
individual case an amount in excess of $2,500,000 or (ii) in the aggregate at
any time an amount in excess of $5,000,000 (in either case not adequately
covered by insurance as to which a solvent and unaffiliated insurance company
has acknowledged coverage) shall be rendered against the Borrower, any
Subsidiary or any combination thereof and the same shall remain undischarged for
a period of 30 consecutive days during which execution shall not be effectively
stayed, or any action shall be legally taken by a judgment creditor to attach or
levy upon any assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary to enforce any such
judgment;

                  (m) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of
the Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events that have
occurred, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (n) a Change in Control shall occur;

                  (o) any Lien purported to be created under any Security
Document shall cease to be, or shall be asserted by any Loan Party not to be, a
valid and perfected Lien on any Collateral having an aggregate fair market value
of $1,000,000 or more, with the priority required by the applicable Security
Document, except (i) as a result of the sale or other disposition of the
applicable Collateral in a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents or
(ii) as a result of the Administrative Agent's failure to maintain possession of
any stock certificates, promissory notes or other instruments delivered to it
under any Security Document;

                  (p) at any time after the execution and delivery thereof, (i)
the Collateral Agreement for any reason, other than the satisfaction in full of
all Obligations and termination of the Commitments, shall cease to be in full
force and effect (other than in accordance with its terms) or shall be declared
to be null and void or any Subsidiary Loan Party shall repudiate its obligations
thereunder, (ii) this Agreement or any Security Document ceases to be in full
force and effect (other than by reason of a release of Collateral in accordance
with the terms hereof or thereof or the satisfaction in full of the Obligations
in


                                      69
<PAGE>

accordance with the terms hereof) or shall be declared null and void (other
than with respect to Collateral with an aggregate fair market value of which
does not exceed $1,000,000) or (iii) any Loan Party shall contest the validity
or enforceability of any Loan Document in writing or deny in writing that it has
any further liability, including with respect to future advances by Lenders,
under any Loan Document to which it is a party;

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Borrower
described in clause (i) or (j) of this Article), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the
request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, take either or
both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the
Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii)
declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part,
in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter
be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so
declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all
fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due
and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any
event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (i) or (j) of this
Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the
Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and
other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph, if at any time
within 60 days after an acceleration of the Loans pursuant to such paragraph
Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all payments on account of
principal which shall have become due otherwise than as a result of such
acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent permitted by law, on
overdue interest, at the rates specified in this Agreement) and all Events of
Default (other than non-payment of the principal of and accrued interest on the
Loans, in each case which is due and payable solely by virtue of acceleration)
shall be remedied or waived, then Required Lenders, by written notice to
Borrower, may at their option rescind and annul such acceleration and its
consequences; but such action shall not affect any subsequent Event of Default
or impair any right consequent thereon. The provisions of this paragraph are
intended merely to bind Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election
of Required Lenders and are not intended to benefit Borrower and do not grant
Borrower the right to require Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration
hereunder or preclude Lenders from exercising any of their rights and remedies
under the Loan Documents, even if the conditions set forth herein are met.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

                  SECTION 8.01 General.

         Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.


                                       70
<PAGE>

         Each Lender hereby further authorizes Collateral Agent to enter into
each Security Document as secured party on behalf of and for the benefit of
Lenders and agrees to be bound by the terms of each Security Document; provided
that Collateral Agent shall not enter into or consent to any amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of any provision contained in any Security
Document without the prior consent of Required Lenders; provided further,
however, that, without further written consent or authorization from Lenders,
Collateral Agent may execute any documents or instruments necessary to effect
the release of any asset constituting Collateral from the Lien of the applicable
Security Document in the event that such asset is sold or otherwise disposed of
in a transaction effected in accordance with Sections 6.03 or 6.04 (and shall,
at the reasonable request of Borrower execute such documents and instruments).

         The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

         The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is
required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set
forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and
shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the
bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken
by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not
to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is
given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain
or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or
other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or
(v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere
herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.


                                       71
<PAGE>

         The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

         Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the
Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an
office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative
Agent.

         Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Each
Lender further acknowledges that each of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. and Credit
Suisse First Boston shall have no obligations under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.02  Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account

                  (a) Within sixty (60) days following the Effective Date, the
Borrower shall establish with the Administrative Agent (i) an account (the
"Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account") in the name of the Administrative Agent
(for the benefit of the Lenders), into which the Borrower may from time to time
deposit Dollars pursuant to, and in accordance with Sections 2.10(c) and 2.10(f)
hereof. The Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account shall be under the sole
dominion and control of the Administrative Agent and shall be subject to a
control agreement entered into between the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent. In the case of funds deposited in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral
Account (i) in accordance with Section 2.10(c), unless a Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Administrative Agent will release such funds as set forth
in Section 2.10(c) and (ii) in accordance with Section 2.10(f), the
Administrative Agent will apply such funds as set forth in Section 2.10(f).

                  (b) The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized and directed
to invest and reinvest the funds from time to time deposited into the Breakage
Cost Cash Collateral Account, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, on the instructions of the Borrower (provided, that any such
instructions given verbally shall be confirmed promptly in writing) or, if the
Borrower shall fail to give such instructions upon delivery of any such funds,
in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent; provided, that in no event
may the Borrower give instructions to the Administrative Agent to, or may the
Administrative Agent in its discretion, invest or reinvest funds in the Breakage
Cost Cash Collateral Account in anything other than Cash Equivalents.

                  (c) Any net income or gain on the investment of funds from
time to time held in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account, shall be
promptly reinvested by the Administrative Agent as a part of the Breakage Cost
Cash Collateral Account; and any net loss on any such investment shall be
charged against the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account.

                  (d) The Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any of the
Lenders shall not be a trustee for any of the Loan Parties, or shall have any
obligations or responsibilities, or shall be liable for anything done or not
done, in connection with the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account, except as
expressly provided herein and except that the Administrative Agent shall have
the obligations of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code. None of
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any of the Lenders shall have any
obligation or responsibility or shall be liable in any way for any investment
decision made in accordance with this Section 8.02 or for any decrease in the
value of the investments held in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account.

                  (e) Grant of Security Interest. For value received and to
induce the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit and the Lenders to enter into
this Agreement, as security for the payment of all of the Obligations, each of
the Loan Parties hereby assigns to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of
the Lenders) and grants to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the
Lenders), a first priority Lien upon all of such Loan Party's rights in and to
the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account, all cash, documents, instruments and
securities from time to time held therein, and all rights pertaining to
investments of funds in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account and all
products and proceeds of any of the foregoing. All Cash, documents, instruments
and securities from time to time on deposit in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral
Account, and all rights pertaining to investments of funds in the Breakage Cost
Cash Collateral Account shall immediately and without any need for any further
action on the part of any of the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent or any
of the Lenders, become subject to the Lien set forth in this Section, be deemed
Collateral for all purposes hereof and be subject to the provisions of this
Credit Agreement.

                  (f) Remedies. At any time during the continuation of an Event
of Default, the Administrative Agent may sell any documents, instruments and
securities held in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account and may immediately
apply the proceeds thereof and any other cash held in the Breakage Cost Cash
Collateral Account in accordance with Section 2.10.

                  (h) Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number

                  SECTION 9.02 Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right
or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or


                                       74
<PAGE>

the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the
Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the
Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 2.20, no such
agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment or Applicable Percentage of any
Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal
amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or
reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender
affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal
amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees
payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or
postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.10 or Section
2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
(giving effect to the inclusion of any Lenders making Incremental Loans)
required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in
the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class)
required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release any
Subsidiary Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Collateral Agreement (except
as expressly provided in the Collateral Agreement), or limit its liability in
respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii)
release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the
Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) change
any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms adversely
affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any
Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without the
written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding
Loans and unused Commitments of each adversely affected Class (in addition to
any consent required under any other clause of this Section), (ix) change the
rights of the Tranche B Term Loan Lenders to decline mandatory prepayments as
provided in Section 2.10, without the written consent of Tranche B Term Loan
Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Tranche B Term Loans; provided
further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline
Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

                  SECTION 9.03 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The
Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation,
execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement or any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection
with the issuance,


                                       75
<PAGE>

amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for
payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of
its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this
Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued
hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of
Credit.

                  (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by
the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan
or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal
by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if
the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any presence or release of
Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective
claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether
any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to
any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                  (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage
(determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity
payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense
or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case
may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.

                  (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds thereof.

                  (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly after written demand therefor.

                  SECTION 9.04 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including
any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that

                                       76
<PAGE>

(i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be
null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph
(b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                           (A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the
         Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate
         of a Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and

                           (B)      the Administrative Agent, provided that no
         consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment
         to an assignee that is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an
         Approved Fund immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.

         (ii)     Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
         conditions:

                  (C)      except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an
         Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, or an assignment of the
         entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the
         amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such
         assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
         with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative
         Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 for the Revolving Loan
         Facility or $1,000,000 for the Term Loan facilities unless each of the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that
         no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of
         Default under Article VII has occurred and is continuing;

                  (D)      each partial assignment shall be made as an
         assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Agreement, provided that this Section
         9.04(b)(ii)(B) shall not be construed to prohibit assignment of a
         proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
         in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;

                  (E)      the parties to each assignment shall execute and
         deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption,
         together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;

                  (F)      the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
         deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;
         and

                  (G)      in the case of an assignment by a Lender to a CLO (as
         defined below) managed by such Lender or by an Affiliate of such
         Lender, unless such assignment (or an assignment to a CLO managed by
         the same manager or an Affiliate of such manager) shall have have been
         approved by the Company (the Company hereby agreeing that such
         approval, if


                                       77
<PAGE>

         requested will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the assigning
         Lender shall retain the sole right to approve any amendment,
         modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, provided
         that the Assignment and Assumption between such Lender and such CLO may
         provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of such CLO,
         agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first
         proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such CLO.

         For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the terms "Approved Fund" and
"CLO" have the following meanings:

         "Approved Fund" means (a) with respect to any Lender, a CLO managed by
such Lender or by an Affiliate of such Lender and (b) with respect to any Lender
that is a fund which invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit, any
other fund that invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit and is
managed by the same investment advisor as such Lender or by an Affiliate of such
investment advisor.

         "CLO" means any entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or
otherwise) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing
in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
business and is administered or managed by a Lender or an Affiliate of such
Lender.

         (ii)     Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
         paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date
         specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder
         shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by
         such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a
         Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall,
         to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
         Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and,
         in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
         assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
         Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
         entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any
         assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
         Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated
         for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
         participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
         paragraph (c) of this Section.

         (iii)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent
         of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
         Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
         recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
         Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements
         owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
         (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and
         the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
         Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
         pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
         this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register
         shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and
         any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
         reasonable prior notice.

         (iv)     Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption
         executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
         completed Administrative


                                       78
<PAGE>

         Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
         hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
         (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required
         by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept
         such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained
         therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes
         of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as
         provided in this paragraph.

                  (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all
or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without
the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

         (ii)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
         payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would
         have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
         such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
         Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A
         Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall
         not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is
         notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
         Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
         Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.

                  (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or
Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

                  SECTION 9.05 Survival. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had
notice or


                                       79
<PAGE>

knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article
VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  SECTION 9.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and
any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall
have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent
shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision
in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 9.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at
any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account
of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) which such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service
of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the law of the State of New York.

                  (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment,
and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may


                                       80
<PAGE>

be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to
bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against the Borrower
or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court
referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.

                  (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

                  SECTION 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                  SECTION 9.11 Headings. Article and Section headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not
part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.12 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality
of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents,
including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors who have a legitimate
need to know such information (it being understood that the Persons to whom such
disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)
to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee
of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective
counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to
the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to
the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from


                                       81
<PAGE>

the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower;
provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the
date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as
confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to
its own confidential information.

                  SECTION 9.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to
any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as
interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall
exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for,
charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date
of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

         We are licensed to practice law only in the state of Georgia;
therefore, this letter of opinion is limited in all respects to the federal laws
of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Georgia. No opinion
is being expressed with respect to any matter which may arise under the laws of
any other jurisdiction or any effect which such laws might have on the opinions
herein set forth.

         In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals, or copies
identified to our satisfaction as being true copies, of such records, documents
or other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable
us to render the opinions expressed below, including, without limitation, a
certified copy of the organization documents identified on SCHEDULE 2, attached
hereto and made a part hereof, as to each Subsidiary's existence in the State of
Georgia (collectively, the "Secretary of State's Certificates"). We have also
reviewed the following documents, all dated as of the date of this letter:

         (a) The Credit Agreement;

         (b) The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the "Collateral
Agreement");

         (c) the Possessory Certificates (as defined herein) identified on
SCHEDULE 1; and

         (d) an unfiled copy of a financing statement identifying the name of
each Subsidiary listed on SCHEDULE 3 attached hereto and made a part hereof, as
debtor, and "JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Collateral Agent", as secured party, which
we understand will be filed within ten (10) days of the transfer of the security
interest in the filing office identified opposite each Subsidiary's name on
SCHEDULE 3 attached hereto and made a part hereof (such filing office(s), the
"Filing Office(s)" and such financing statement, the "Financing Statement(s)").

         The documents referenced in items (a) through (d) above are
collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents." The documents
referenced in items (b), (c) and (d) above are collectively referred to herein
as the "Collateral Documents."

         In examining the above documents, we have assumed the genuineness of
all signatures (other than signatures of representatives of the Subsidiaries,
with which we are familiar), the authenticity of all documents purporting to be
originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents purporting to be
copies.

         With respect to matters of fact, we have assumed, without undertaking
to verify such facts by independent investigation, the accuracy, as of the date
of this letter as well as the date made, of each Secretary of State's
Certificate, and have relied upon all representations and warranties in the Loan
Documents and the accuracy of all certificates of officers of Borrower,
officers, members or partners of the Subsidiaries, of public officials and of
others.

         Except with respect to the Subsidiaries, we also have assumed, for
purposes of the opinions herein expressed, without any inquiry or other
investigation, that each party to the Loan Documents (i) is duly incorporated or
otherwise duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation; (ii) has all requisite power and
authority to execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under the Loan
Documents and each of the other documents and agreements executed by it with
respect to the transactions contemplated thereby to which such Persons are
parties; and (iii) has duly authorized, executed and delivered each of the Loan
Documents to which it is a party. We have also assumed, for purposes of the
opinions herein expressed, without any inquiry or other investigation, that with
respect to each party to the Loan Documents, including without limitation, the
Subsidiaries, the Loan Documents constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligation of each party thereto, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms. Except as expressly covered in this opinion, we do not express any
opinion as to the effect of compliance by the Administrative Agent and each of
the Lenders with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to the
transactions because of the nature of any of their businesses.

         With respect to the Loan Documents and all of the other documents with
respect to the transactions contemplated thereby, we have further assumed that,
to the extent certain standards of conduct may be imposed as a matter of law on
the Administrative Agent or Lenders as a condition to or a requirement for
enforceability (including, without limitation, any requirement that the
Administrative Agent or Lenders act reasonably, in good faith, in a commercially
reasonable manner, or otherwise in compliance with applicable law), the
Administrative Agent and Lenders will comply with such standards of conduct.

         We have also assumed, without any inquiry or other investigation, that
(i) each Subsidiary owns, or with respect to after-acquired property will own,
the UCC Collateral granted by it, and we express no opinion as to the nature or
extent of each Subsidiary's rights in any of the applicable UCC Collateral and
we note that with respect to any after-acquired property, the security interest
will not attach until such Subsidiary acquires ownership; (ii) the funds to be
loaned or advanced to Borrower, as contemplated by the Credit Agreement, will be
delivered to, and received by, Borrower; (iii) the obligations of Subsidiaries
to Lenders have not been previously satisfied; (iv) all restrictions

contained in the Credit Agreement regarding Borrower's right to use the proceeds
of the Loans are commercially reasonable and imposed by the Lenders in good
faith; (v) the rate of interest to be charged under the Loan Documents will not
exceed 5% per month; (vi) there will not occur with respect to any transaction
contemplated by the Loan Documents any mutual mistake of fact or
misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; and (vii) there is no
agreement or understanding, whether written or oral, between any party to any
Loan Document, and there is no usage of trade or course of dealing between any
such party and any other person, that would limit, define, supplement or qualify
any provision of such Loan Document.

         We note that we have delivered to you our opinion with respect to each
Subsidiary's status as a "registered organization." Except to the extent that
this determination is an element of your choice of law analysis, we express no
opinion with respect to the choice of law governing perfection, the effect of
perfection and non-perfection or priority of the security interest.

         No opinion is expressed herein with respect to (a) the validity,
binding effect or enforceability of those provisions of the documents described
herein which provide or may be deemed to provide that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender is required to furnish reasonable notification of
disposition of collateral pursuant to Section 9-611 of the UCC or otherwise to
act in good faith in a commercially reasonable manner with respect to
disposition of collateral; (b) those provisions of the Loan Documents which may
require payment of interest on unpaid interest; (c) any matter involving the
Federal Trade Commission or any state commission or similar body which regulates
franchises and franchising activities; (d) any matters involving the
Environmental Protection Agency, any state environmental protection agency or
any federal or state statute, rule or regulation related to environmental
protection; (e) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (as
amended); (f) state or federal securities, commodities, futures, or "blue sky"
laws; (g) state or federal antifraud or antitrust laws; (h) any matters arising
out of or in connection with the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act of 1989, 12 U.S.C. Sections 1811 et seq. or the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvements Act of 1991 (in each case, as amended); (i)
the validity or enforceability of a security interest in or assignment of any
account receivable with respect to which the account debtor is the United
States, or any agency, department or instrumentality of the United States, or in
any other UCC Collateral which is the subject of Federal law; (j) whether the
borrowing evidenced by the Loan Documents is usurious under applicable laws; (k)
the effect of any land use law, rule, regulation or ordinance; or (l) federal,
state or local taxes.

of the impracticality or impossibility of the performance of such contract, or
(f) affording any defense to the enforcement of a contract based upon the
unconscionability of the conduct after such contract has been entered into of a
party seeing such enforcement); (iii) the effect of course of dealing, course of
performance or the like that would modify the terms of an agreement or the
respective rights or obligations of the parties under an agreement; (iv) the
possible unenforceability of provisions that enumerated remedies are not
exclusive or that a party has the right to pursue multiple remedies without
regard to other remedies elected or that all remedies are cumulative; (v) the
effect of O.C.G.A. Section 13-1-11 on provisions relating to attorneys fees;
(vi) the possible unenforceability of provisions permitting modifications of an
agreement only in writing; (vii) the possible unenforceability of provisions to
the effect that the provisions of an agreement are severable; (viii) the effect
of laws requiring mitigation of damages; (ix) Lender's right to collect any
payment due to the extent that such payment constitutes a penalty, forfeiture or
late payment charge; (x) the possible unenforceability of those provisions of
the Collateral Agreement that purport to secure any advances or other extensions
of credit other than advances made pursuant to the Credit Agreement; (xi) the
possible unenforceability of provisions of the Loan Documents allowing Lender to
set off or apply any of the Borrower's deposit to such entities obligations
under the Loan Documents without prior notice being given to the Borrower or to
exercise other remedial rights without notice to the Borrower; (xii) the
judicial application of the law of, or a governmental act of, a non-United
States jurisdiction; (xiii) the illegality of all or any portion of a Loan
Document under the law of any jurisdiction other than Georgia in which such Loan

perfection of a security interest with respect to any proceeds (as such term in
defined in Section 9-102(a)(63) of the UCC, except to the extent provided in
Section 9-315 of the UCC and, in addition, we call to your attention that in the
case of certain types of proceeds, other parties such as holders in due course,
protected purchasers of securities, persons who obtain control over securities
entitlements and buyers in the ordinary course of business may acquire a
superior interest or may take their interest free of the security interest of a
secured party.

         Certain remedial and exculpatory provisions contained in the Loan
Documents may be unenforceable including (i) certain self-help provisions and
provisions which purport to create evidentiary standards or standards of care;
(ii) provisions which purport to restrict access to legal or equitable remedies
or to waive or release any statutory provisions or common law rights or benefits
that may not be waived or released; (iii) under certain circumstances,
provisions declaring that the failure to exercise or delay in exercising rights
or remedies will not operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy; and (iv)
provisions regarding indemnification against liabilities where such
indemnification is contrary to public policy.

         Any qualification of the opinions herein to "our knowledge" or "the
best of our knowledge" means the actual awareness of information by the lawyers
in our firm who have had actual involvement (i) in acting as counsel in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents; (ii) in the
preparation of this letter of opinion; or (iii) in rendering specific legal
advice in connection with the operations and business affairs of our clients,
when called upon to do so. References "to our knowledge" or "best of our
knowledge" shall not create or infer any obligation on our part to have
undertaken any investigation or inquiry with respect to the matters with respect
to which such references are made.

         Based upon and subject to all qualifications, conditions, limitations,
exceptions and assumptions set forth in this letter, we are of the opinion that,
as of the date hereof:

         (1) SCC, AFCPI, AFCL, CTH, and AFC Holdings are duly organized and
validly existing in the State of Georgia.

         (2) The execution and delivery by the Subsidiaries of the Loan
Documents and their compliance with the terms and conditions thereof, to the
extent to which they are parties thereto, do not conflict with, result in a
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, Articles of
Organization, or Operating Agreement of the Subsidiaries, as the case may be.

         (3) The Loan Documents have been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by each Subsidiary, to the extent it is a party thereto.

         (4) Pursuant to the Collateral Agreement, each Subsidiary has
authorized for purposes of Section 9-509 of the Filing State UCC the filing of
the Financing Statement naming such Subsidiary as debtor.

         (5) Each of the Financing Statements includes not only all of the types
of information required by Section 9-502(a) of the Filing State UCC but also the
types of information without which the Filing Office may refuse to accept the
Financing Statements pursuant to Section 9-516 of the Filing State UCC.

         (6) Under the Filing State UCC, the security interest of the Collateral
Agent will be perfected in each of the Subsidiary's rights in all UCC Collateral
upon the later of the attachment of the security interest and the filing of the
Financing Statements in the Filing Office; provided, however, we express no
opinion, with respect to (i) any security interest in trademarks, patents, and
copyrights, except to the extent Article 9 of the UCC may be applicable to the
foregoing, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we express no
opinion as to the effect of any federal laws relating to trademarks, patents and
copyrights or other intellectual property on the opinions expressed herein, (ii)
money, (iii) deposit accounts, (iv) letter of credit rights (v) goods covered by
a certificate of title statute, (vi) as-extracted collateral and timber to be
cut, (vii) real property or interests in real property or goods which are, or
are to become fixtures, (viii) any property subject to a statute, regulation or
treaty of the United States whose requirements for a security interest's
obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the
property preempt Section 9-310(a) of the Filing State UCC, (ix) any goods
subject to a negotiable document of title; (x) commercial tort claims; or (xi)
any goods which are accessions to, or commingled or processed with, other goods
to the extent that the security interest is limited by Section 9-335 or 9-336 of
the UCC. In the case of property which becomes UCC Collateral after the date
hereof, Section 552 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code limits the extent to which
property acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code may be subject to a security interest arising from a security
agreement entered into by the debtor before the commencement of such case.

         (7) You have asked whether each Subsidiary is a "registered
organization" as defined in the Filing State UCC. Pursuant to the corporate laws
set forth on EXHIBIT A attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "Filing
State's Corporate Law"), the Secretary of State of the Filing State is

required to maintain a public record showing each Subsidiary to have been
organized. Based on our review of the Secretary of State Certificates, we are of
the opinion that under the Filing State UCC and the Filing State's Corporate
Law, each Subsidiary is a "registered organization."

         We call to your attention the fact that the perfection of the above
security interests in the UCC Collateral will be terminated or the effectiveness
thereof will lapse (i) as to any UCC Collateral acquired by Subsidiaries more
than four months after such Subsidiary changes its name, identity or corporate
structure so as to make the Financing Statements seriously misleading, unless a
new appropriate financing statement indicating the new name, identity or
corporate structure of such Subsidiary is properly filed before the expiration
of such four months; and (ii) as to all such UCC Collateral, five years after
the date of the original filing unless a continuation statement is filed within
the period of six months prior to the expiration of such five years.

         The foregoing opinions are subject to the qualification that we express
no opinion as the creation, validity, attachment or perfection of the security
interest created by the Collateral Agreement insofar as they are not governed by
Article 9 of the UCC.

         All opinions rendered herein are as of the date hereof and are based
upon the circumstances that exist at the present time, including, without
limitation, statutes, cases, regulations, facts and circumstances as they
currently exist, all of which are subject to change. We assume no obligation to
update or supplement the opinions given herein to reflect any facts or
circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in laws
or interpretations thereof, which may hereafter occur.

         Except as to the matters, documents and transactions specifically
addressed herein, we express no opinion whatsoever, and no opinion whatsoever is
to be inferred, as to any other matter, document or transaction.

         This opinion is being furnished only to you in connection with the
Credit Agreement and is solely for your benefit and is not to be used,
circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or relied upon
by any other person or entity for any purpose without our prior written consent
except that Lenders and any other permitted transferees who subsequently become
assignees pursuant to Section 9.04 of the Credit Agreement may rely on it as if
it was addressed to the Administrative Agent for their benefit.

                                                     Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We have acted as special counsel to AFC Enterprises, Inc., a Minnesota
corporation (the "Borrower"), in connection with that certain Credit Agreement
dated as of May 23, 2002 (the "Credit Agreement") among the Borrower, J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPMorgan") and Credit Suisse First Boston ("CSFB"), as
Joint Bookrunners and Co-Lead Arrangers, and JPMorgan Chase Bank (the
"Administrative Agent"), as Administrative Agent for the financial institutions
set forth in the Credit Agreement on Schedule 2.01 (each, including the Lenders
described in the Credit Agreement, JPMorgan, CSFB , and the Administrative
Agent, are referred to herein individually as a "Lender" and collectively as
"Lenders"). This opinion is being delivered pursuant to subsection 4.01(b) of
the Credit Agreement.

         Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meanings as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and, if not defined
therein, as set forth in the Collateral Agreement (as such agreement is defined
below).

         In connection with this opinion, we have examined the following
documents:

         (i)      the Credit Agreement;

         (ii)     the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement dated May 23, 2002,
                  among the Company, the Subsidiary Parties (as defined therein)
                  and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Collateral Agent for the benefit
                  of the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Collateral Agent") (the
                  "Collateral Agreement");

         (iii)    the UCC financing statement in the form of Exhibit A hereto
                  (which is referred to herein as the "Financing Statement," and
                  together with the Credit Agreements and the other agreements
                  described on Exhibit A hereto, collectively, the "Loan
                  Documents," and individually and without distinction, as a
                  "Loan Document")

         (iv)     a copy of the Articles of Incorporation of the Borrower,
                  certified as of April 29, 2002, as a true copy by the
                  Minnesota Secretary of State;

         (v)      a certificate of good standing concerning the Borrower from
                  the Minnesota Secretary of State issued May 21, 2002; and

         (vi)     a certificate of an officer of the Borrower certifying as to
                  (A) a copy of resolutions of the Board of Directors of the
                  Borrower adopted May 14, 2002, (B) incumbency with respect to
                  officer of the Borrower, (C) a copy of the Articles of
                  Incorporation of the Borrower, and (D) a copy of the bylaws of
                  the Borrower.

         In addition, as to questions of fact material to the opinions
hereinafter expressed, we have, when relevant facts were not independently
established by us, relied upon certificates and opinions of the Borrower and its
officers, and of public officials. We have not independently examined the
records of any court or public office in any jurisdiction, and our opinion is
subject to matters which examination of such records would reveal. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, we have relied upon certificates of
officers of the Borrower referenced in item (vi), above, and the representations
contained therein, and we have assumed that all such representations are true
and correct as of the date of this opinion.

         Our opinions expressed below as to certain factual matters are
qualified as being limited "to our actual knowledge" or by other words to the
same or similar effect. Such words, as used herein, mean that prior to or during
the course of this firm's representation of the Borrower in connection with the
specific transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, no contrary
information came to the attention of the attorney in our firm who have
represented the Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Loan Documents and the preparation of this opinion. In rendering such opinions,
we have not conducted any independent investigation of the Borrower or consulted
with other attorneys in our firm with respect to the matters covered thereby. No
inference as to our knowledge with respect to the factual matters upon which we
have so qualified our opinions should be drawn from the fact of our
representation of the Borrower.

         In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed, with the
Collateral Agent's permission and without verification:

         (a)      the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
                  originals,

         (b)      the genuineness of all signatures,

         (c)      the legal capacity of natural persons,

         (d)      the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to us
                  as copies and the authenticity of the originals of such
                  copies,

         (e)      the accuracy as to factual matters of the representations and
                  warranties of the Borrower contained in the Loan Documents,

         (f)      that the Financing Statement contains the current address of
                  the Collateral Agent from which information concerning the
                  Collateral Agent's security interest in the collateral
                  described in the Collateral Agreement (hereinafter, the
                  "Collateral") can

                  be obtained, the correct organizational number of the
                  Borrower, and a current mailing address of the Borrower,

         (g)      that the Borrower has rights in the Collateral,

         (h)      the due authorization of the Loan Documents by the parties
                  thereto, other than the Borrower, and the execution and
                  delivery of the Loan Documents by the parties thereto,
                  including the Borrower, and

         (i)      that the Loan Documents constitute the valid, binding and
                  enforceable obligations of the parties thereto, including the
                  Borrower.

         Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as we have deemed
necessary, and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the
opinion that:

         1. The Borrower is a corporation incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota, with corporate power to
conduct any lawful business activity.

         2. The Borrower has the corporate power to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under the Loan Documents executed by it, and has taken all
requisite corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of the Loan Documents executed by the Borrower.

         3. The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents
executed by the Borrower and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
under the Loan Documents executed by the Borrower will not violate or cause a
breach of any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws of the
Borrower.

         4. Under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the
State of Minnesota, Minn. Stat. ss. 336.1-101, et seq. (the "Minnesota UCC" or
"UCC"), the State of Minnesota is the proper jurisdiction in which to file a
financing statement to perfect the Collateral Agent's security interest in the
Collateral. The Financing Statement is sufficient in form for filing with the
Minnesota Secretary of State and, upon such filing, will perfect the Collateral
Agent's security interest in the Collateral to the extent a security interest in
the Collateral may be perfected under the Minnesota UCC by filing financing
statements in the State of Minnesota.

         5. Based upon Minnesota Stat.ss.302A.151 attached hereto as Exhibit B,
the Borrower is a "registered organization" within the meaning of 336.9-102(70)
of the Minnesota UCC.


                                SCOPE OF OPINION

         Our opinions set forth above are further subject to the following
additional qualifications:

         (a) Our opinions expressed above are limited to the law of the State of
Minnesota.

         (b) Our opinions are subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, statutes of
limitation, or other similar laws and judicial decisions affecting or relating
to the rights of creditors generally, and are further subject to the effect of
general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of
materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, estoppel, election of
remedies and other similar doctrines affecting the enforcement of agreements
generally (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at
law or in equity). In addition, the availability of specific performance,
injunctive relief, the appointment of a receiver or other equitable remedies is
subject to the discretion of the tribunal before which any proceeding therefor
may be brought.

         (c) Our opinions in paragraph 4, above, as to perfection of the
security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral, are further subject
to the following additional qualifications:

                  (i) we express no opinion as to Collateral which consists of
         or will consist of consumer goods or accounts resulting from the sale
         thereof, beneficial interests in a trust or decedent's estate, deposit
         accounts, commercial tort claims, letters of credit or letter of credit
         rights, goods subject to certificates of title (including, without
         limitation, motor vehicles), equipment to be used in farming
         operations, farm products, agricultural or farm property, accounts or
         general intangibles arising from or relating to the sale of farm
         products, crops, timber, minerals, oil, gas or the like, or items which
         are subject to a statute or treaty of the United States which provides
         for a national or international certificate of title for the perfection
         of a security interest therein or which specifies a place of filing
         different from that specified in the Minnesota UCC for filing to
         perfect such security interest, or in the case of the sale of any of
         the foregoing, accounts, promissory notes or general intangibles
         arising with respect thereto;

                  (ii) we express no opinion as to matters excluded from Article
         9 of the Minnesota UCC by Section 336.9-109 of the UCC;

                  (iii) the effect of Section 336.9-315 of the Minnesota UCC as
         to proceeds of Collateral and Sections 336.9-320 and 336.9-330 of the
         Minnesota UCC as to buyers and purchasers of Collateral in certain
         circumstances;

                  (iv) the requirement that continuation statements with respect
         to the Financing Statement be filed within six months prior to the
         fifth, tenth, fifteenth, etc. anniversaries of the original filing of
         the Financing Statement;

                  (v) the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the
         Collateral may become unperfected if the Borrower changes its name,
         jurisdiction of formation or its status therein, or identity or entity
         structure;

                  (vi) we express no opinion as to the validity or perfection of
         any security interest purported to be granted in that portion of the
         Collateral that constitutes an interest or claim in or under a policy
         of insurance (except as provided in Section 336.9-9-315 of the
         Minnesota UCC with respect to proceeds), a right represented by a
         judgment, a right of setoff, a claim arising out of tort or an interest
         in any deposit account (except as provided in Section 336.9-9-315 of
         the Minnesota UCC with respect to proceeds);

                  (vii) in the case of Collateral consisting of money (as such
         term is defined in the Minnesota UCC) not constituting part of a
         chattel paper (as such term is defined in the Minnesota UCC), the
         security interest granted pursuant to the Collateral Agreement cannot
         be perfected by filing the Financing Statement but can only be
         perfected if possession thereof is obtained;

                  (viii) we express no opinion with respect to the perfection of
         the Collateral Agent's security interest in any patents, patent
         applications, patents pending, copyrights, trademarks, trade names,
         trademark registrations or other interests subject to federal patent,
         trademark or copyright laws except to the extent a court of competent
         jurisdiction holds that Article 9 of the Minnesota UCC applies;

                  (ix) we express no opinion concerning the Borrower's rights in
         or title to any personal property; and

                  (x) we express no opinion with respect to the priority,
         creation, validity or attachment of the security interest, but have
         assumed for purposes of the opinions set forth herein that such
         security interest is valid and has been created and has attached under
         the laws of the State of New York.

         Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meanings as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and, if not defined
therein, as set forth in the Collateral Agreement (as such agreement is defined
below). As used herein:

         (a) "UCC" means the Filing State UCC (as such term is defined below).

         (b) "UCC Collateral" means that portion of the following collateral to
         the extent such collateral is of a type subject to Article 9 of the
         UCC: (a) the Article 9 Collateral (as such term is defined in the
         Collateral Agreement), (b) the Pledged Collateral (as such term is
         defined in the Collateral Agreement) and (c) the Possessory
         Certificates (as such term is defined below).

         (c) "Filing State" means Texas.

         (d) "Filing State UCC" means the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect
         on the date hereof in the Filing State (without regard to laws
         referenced in Section 9-201 thereof).

         We are licensed to practice law only in the state of Texas. Therefore,
this letter of opinion is limited in all respects to the federal laws of the
United States of America and the laws of the State of Texas. No opinion is being
expressed with respect to any matter which may arise under the laws of any other
jurisdiction or any effect which such laws might have on the opinions herein set
forth.

         In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals, or copies
identified to our satisfaction as being true copies, of such records, documents
or other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable
us to render the opinions expressed below, including, without limitation, a
certified copy of the organization documents identified on Schedule 1, attached
hereto and made a part hereof, as to CT's existence (the "Secretary of State's
Certificates"). We have also reviewed unexecuted copies of the following
documents, all dated as of the date of this letter:

         (a) The Credit Agreement;

         (b) The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the "Collateral
         Agreement"); and

         (c) an acknowledgment copy of a financing statement identifying CT as
         the debtor and The JP Morgan Chase Bank, as "Collateral Agent," as
         secured party which we understand will be filed within ten (10) days of
         the transfer of the security interest in the office of the Secretary of
         the State of Texas (such filing office(s), the "Filing Office(s)" and
         such financing statement, the "Financing Statement(s)").

         The documents referenced in items (a) through (c) above are
collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents." The documents
referenced in items (b), and (c) above are collectively referred to herein as
the "Collateral Documents."


<PAGE>

August 13, 2002
Page 3

         In examining the above documents, we have assumed the genuineness of
all signatures, the authenticity of all documents purporting to be originals and
the conformity to the originals of all documents purporting to be copies.

         With respect to matters of fact, we have assumed, without undertaking
to verify such facts by independent investigation, the accuracy, as of the date
of this letter as well as the date made, of the Secretary of State's
Certificate, and have relied upon, all representations and warranties in the
Loan Documents and the accuracy of all certificates of members of CTH, CTH as
its general partner of CT and of the public officials and of others.

         Except with respect to CT, we also have assumed, for purposes of the
opinions herein expressed, without any inquiry or other investigation, that each
party to the Loan Documents (i) is duly incorporated or otherwise duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation; (ii) has all requisite power and authority to
execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under the Loan Documents and each
of the other documents and agreements executed by it with respect to the
transactions contemplated thereby to which such Persons are parties; (iii) has
duly authorized, executed and delivered each of the Loan Documents to which it
is a party; and (iv) the Loan Documents constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligation of each party thereto, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms. With respect to items (i) - (iv) above as they relate to CTH and AFC
Holdings we have relied on the opinion of Cohen Pollock Merlin Axelrod & Small,
P.C. Except as expressly covered in this opinion, we do not express any opinion
as to the effect of compliance by the Administrative Agent and each of the
Lenders with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to the
transactions because of the nature of any of their businesses.

         With respect to the Loan Documents and all of the other documents with
respect to the transactions contemplated thereby, we have further assumed that,
to the extent certain standards of conduct may be imposed as a matter of law on
the Administrative Agent or Lenders as a condition to or a requirement for, such
enforceability (including, without limitation, any requirement that the
Administrative Agent or Lenders act reasonably, in good faith, in a commercially
reasonable manner, or otherwise in compliance with applicable law), the
Administrative Agent and Lenders will comply with such standards of conduct.

         We have also assumed, without any inquiry or other investigation, that
(i) each Subsidiary owns, or with respect to after-acquired property will own,
the UCC Collateral granted by it, that the description of the UCC Collateral is
accurate, and we express no opinion as to the nature or extent of each
Subsidiary's rights in any of the applicable UCC Collateral and we note that
with respect to any after-acquired property, the security interest will not
attach until such Subsidiary acquires ownership; (ii) the funds to be loaned or
advanced to Borrower, as contemplated by the Credit Agreement, will be delivered
to, and received by, Borrower; (iii) the obligations of Subsidiaries to Lenders
have not been previously satisfied; (iv) all restrictions contained in the
Credit Agreement regarding Borrower's right to use the proceeds of the Loans are
commercially reasonable and imposed by the Lenders in good faith; (v) there has
not occurred with respect to any transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents
any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue
influence; and (vi) there is no agreement or understanding, whether written or
oral, between any party to any Loan Document,




<PAGE>

Page 4

and there is no usage of trade or course of dealing between any such party and
any other person, that would limit, define, supplement or qualify any provision
of such Loan Document.

         We note that we have delivered to you our opinion with respect to CT's
status as a "registered organization." Except to the extent that this
determination is an element of your choice of law analysis, we express no
opinion with respect to the choice of law governing perfection, the effect of
perfection and non-perfection or priority of the security interest.

         No opinion is expressed herein with respect to (a) the validity,
binding effect or enforceability of those provisions of the documents described
herein which provide or may be deemed to provide that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender is required to furnish reasonable notification of
disposition of collateral pursuant to Section 9-611 of the UCC or otherwise to
act in good faith in a commercially reasonable manner with respect to
disposition of collateral; (b) those provisions of the Loan Documents which may
require payment of interest on unpaid interest; (c) any matter involving the
Federal Trade Commission or any state commission or similar body which regulates
franchises and franchising activities; (d) any matters involving the
Environmental Protection Agency, any state environmental protection agency or
any federal or state statute, rule or regulation related to environmental
protection; (e) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (as
amended); (f) state or federal securities, commodities, futures, or "blue sky"
laws; (g) state or federal antifraud or antitrust laws; (h) any matters arising
out of or in connection with the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act of 1989, 12 U.S.C. Sections 1811 et seq. or the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvements Act of 1991 (in each case, as amended); (i)
the validity or enforceability of a security interest in or assignment of any
account receivable with respect to which the account debtor is the United
States, or any agency, department or instrumentality of the United States, or in
any other UCC Collateral which is the subject of Federal law; (j) whether the
borrowing evidenced by the Loan Documents is usurious under applicable laws; (k)
the effect of any land use law, rule, regulation or ordinance; or (l) federal,
state or local taxes.

         We express no opinion with respect to the validity or attachment of the
security interest, but have assumed for purposes of the opinions set forth
herein that such security interest is valid and has attached under the laws of
the State of New York.

         Further, the opinions expressed herein are subject to, limited and
qualified by, (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, moratorium, marshaling, arrangement, assignment for benefit of
creditors, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance or other statute, rule,
regulation or other law affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally
(heretofore or hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable)
regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law;
(ii) any general principle of equity, whether applied by a court of law or
equity (including, but not limited to, any principle (a) governing the
availability of discretion of a court, (b) affording any equitable defense, (c)
requiring good faith, fair dealing and reasonableness in the performance and
enforcement of a contract by a party seeking the enforcement of such contract,
(d) requiring consideration of the materiality of a breach of a contract by a
party against whom or which the enforcement of such contract is sought and
consideration of the consequences of such breach to a party seeking such
enforcement, (e) requiring consideration at the time the enforcement of a
contract is attempted of

the impracticality or impossibility of the performance of such contract; or (f)
affording any defense to the enforcement of a contract based upon the
unconscionability of the conduct after such contract has been entered into of a
party seeing such enforcement); (iii) the effect of course of dealing, course of
performance or the like that would modify the terms of an agreement or the
respective rights or obligations of the parties under an agreement; (iv) the
possible unenforceability of provisions that enumerated remedies are not
exclusive or that a party has the right to pursue multiple remedies without
regard to other remedies elected or that all remedies are cumulative; (v) a
limitation that attorneys' fees must be reasonable; (vi) the possible
unenforceability of provisions permitting modifications of an agreement only in
writing; (vii) the possible unenforceability of provisions to the effect that
the provisions of an agreement are severable; (viii) the effect of laws
requiring mitigation of damages; (ix) Lender's right to collect any payment due
to the extent that such payment constitutes a penalty, forfeiture or late
payment charge; (x) the possible unenforceability of those provisions of the
Collateral Agreement that purport to secure any advances or other extensions of
credit other than advances made pursuant to the Credit Agreement; (xi) the
possible unenforceability of provisions of the Loan Documents allowing Lender to
set off or apply any of the Borrower's deposit to such entities obligations
under the Loan Documents without prior notice being given to the Borrower or to
exercise other remedial rights without notice to the Borrower, (xii) the
judicial application of the law of, or a governmental act of, a non-United
States jurisdiction; (xiii) the illegality of all or any portion of a Loan
Document under the law of any jurisdiction other than Texas in which such Loan
Document is performed; and (xiv) the perfection of a security interest with
respect to any proceeds (as such term in defined in Section 9-102(a)(65) of the
UCC, except to the extent provided in Section 9-315 of the UCC and, in addition,
we call to your attention that in the case of certain types of proceeds, other
parties such as holders in due course, protected purchasers of securities,
persons who obtain control over securities entitlements and buyers in the
ordinary course of business may acquire a superior interest or may take their
interest free of the security interest of a secured party.

         Certain remedial and exculpatory provisions contained in the Loan
Documents may be unenforceable including (i) certain self-help provisions and
provisions which purport to create evidentiary standards or standards of care;
(ii) provisions which purport to restrict access to legal or equitable remedies
or to waive or release any statutory provisions or common law rights or benefits
that may not be waived or released; (iii) under certain circumstances,
provisions declaring that the failure to exercise or delay in exercising rights
or remedies will not operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy; and (iv)
provisions regarding indemnification against liabilities where such
indemnification is contrary to public policy.

         Any qualification of the opinions herein to "our knowledge" or "the
best of our knowledge" means the actual awareness of information by the lawyers
in our firm who have had actual involvement (i) in acting as counsel in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents; (ii) in the
preparation of this letter of opinion; or (iii) in rendering specific legal
advice in connection with the operations and business affairs of our clients,
when called upon to do so. References "to our knowledge" or "best of our
knowledge" shall not create or infer any obligation on our part to have
undertaken any investigation or inquiry with respect to the matters with respect
to which such references are made.

         Based upon and subject to all qualifications, conditions, limitations,
exceptions and assumptions set forth in this letter, we are of the opinion that,
as of the date hereof:

         (1) CT is a limited partnership validly existing under the laws of the
         State of Texas.

         (2) The execution and delivery by CT of the Loan Documents and its
         compliance with the terms and conditions thereof, to the extent to
         which it is a party thereto, does not conflict with, result in a breach
         or violation of, or constitute a default under, any of the terms,
         conditions or provisions of the Agreement of Limited Partnership of CT.

         (3) The Loan Documents have been duly authorized, executed and
         delivered by CT to the extent it is a party thereto.

         (4) Pursuant to the Collateral Agreement, CT has authorized for
         purposes of Section 9-509 of the Filing State UCC the filing of the
         Financing Statement naming CT as debtor.

         (5) The Financing Statement includes not only all of the types of
         information required by Section 9-502(a) of the Filing State UCC but
         also the types of information without which the Filing Office may
         refuse to accept the Financing Statements pursuant to Section 9-516 of
         the Filing State UCC.

         (6) Under the Filing State UCC, the security interest of the Collateral
         Agent will be perfected in CT's rights in all UCC Collateral upon the
         later of the attachment of the security interest and the filing of the
         Financing Statements in the Filing Office; provided, however, we
         express no opinion, with respect to (i) any security interest in
         trademarks, patents, and copyrights, except to the extent Article 9 of
         the UCC may be applicable to the foregoing, and, without limiting the
         generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the effect of
         any federal laws relating to trademarks, patents and copyrights or
         other intellectual property on the opinions expressed herein, (ii)
         money, (iii) deposit accounts, (iv) letter of credit rights (v) goods
         covered by a certificate of title statute, (vi) as-extracted collateral
         and timber to be cut, (vii) real property or interests in real property
         or goods which are, or are to become fixtures, (viii) any property
         subject to a statute, regulation or treaty of the United States whose
         requirements for a security interest's obtaining priority over the
         rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property preempt Section
         9-310(a) of the Filing State UCC, (ix) any goods subject to a
         negotiable document of title; (x) commercial tort claims; or (xi) any
         goods which are accessions to, or commingled or processed with, other
         goods to the extent that the security interest is limited by Section
         9-335 or 9-336 of the UCC. In the case of property which becomes UCC
         Collateral after the date hereof, Section 552 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
         Code limits the extent to which property acquired by a debtor after the
         commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code may be subject to
         a security interest arising from a security agreement entered into by
         the debtor before the commencement of such case.

         (7) You have asked whether each Subsidiary is a "registered
         organization" as defined in the Filing State UCC. Pursuant to the
         limited partnership laws set forth on Exhibit A



<PAGE>

August 13, 2002
Page 7


         attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "Filing State's Limited
         Partnership Law"), the Secretary of State of the Filing State is
         required to maintain a public record showing CT to have been organized.
         Based on our review of the Secretary of State Certificates, we are of
         the opinion that under the Filing State UCC and the Filing State's
         Corporate Law, each Subsidiary is a "registered organization."

         We call to your attention the fact that the perfection of the above
security interests in the UCC Collateral will be terminated or the effectiveness
thereof will lapse (i) as to any UCC Collateral acquired by CT more than four
months after CT changes its name, identity or corporate structure so as to make
the Financing Statements seriously misleading, unless a new appropriate
financing statement indicating the new name, identity or corporate structure of
CT is properly filed before the expiration of such four months; and (ii) as to
all such UCC Collateral, five years after the date of the original filing unless
a continuation statement is filed within the period of six months prior to the
expiration of such five years.

         The foregoing opinions are subject to the qualification that we express
no opinion as the creation, validity, attachment or perfection of the security
interest created by the Collateral Agreement insofar as they are not governed by
Article 8 or 9 of the UCC nor do we express any opinion as to the priority of
any security interest created by the Collateral Agreement.

         All opinions rendered herein are as of the date hereof and are based
upon the circumstances that exist at the present time, including, without
limitation, statutes, cases, regulations, facts and circumstances as they
currently exist, all of which are subject to change. We assume no obligation to
update or supplement the opinions given herein to reflect any facts or
circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in laws
or interpretations thereof, which may hereafter occur.

         Except as to the matters, documents and transactions specifically
addressed herein, we express no opinion whatsoever, and no opinion whatsoever is
to be inferred, as to any other matter, document or transaction.

         This opinion is being furnished only to you in connection with the
Credit Agreement and is solely for your benefit and is not to be used,
circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or relied upon
by any other person or entity for any purpose without our prior written consent
except that Lenders and any other permitted transferees who subsequently become
assignees pursuant to Section 9.04 of the Credit Agreement may rely on it as if
it was addressed to the Administrative Agent for their benefit.

                                       Very truly yours,

         Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meanings as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and, if not defined

below).

         In connection with this opinion, we have examined the following
documents:

         (i)      the Credit Agreement;

         (ii)     the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement dated May 23, 2002,

                  benefit of the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Collateral
                  Agent") (the "Collateral Agreement");

                  agreements described on Exhibit A hereto, collectively, the
                  "Loan Documents," and individually and without distinction, as
                  a "Loan Document")

         (iv)     a copy of the Articles of Incorporation of CI, certified as of
                  April 29, 2002, as a true copy by the Washington Secretary of
                  State;

         (v)      a copy of the Articles of Merger of each of CI, SBC and TI,

                  officer of CI;

                  from the Washington Secretary of State issued May 21, 2002;

         (x)      a certificate of an officer of CI certifying as to (A) a copy
                  of resolutions of the Board of Directors of CI adopted May 23,

                  Operating Agreement, as amended, of each of SBC and TI.

         In addition, as to questions of fact material to the opinions
hereinafter expressed, we have, when relevant facts were not independently
established by us, relied upon certificates and opinions of the Companies and
their respective officers, and of public officials. We have not independently
examined the records of any court or public office in any jurisdiction, and our
opinion is subject to matters which examination of such records would reveal.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we have relied upon
certificates of officers of the Companies referenced in item (vi), above, and
the representations contained therein, and we have assumed that all such
representations are true and correct as of the date of this opinion.

         In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed, with the
Lender's permission and without verification:

         (a)      the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
                  originals,

         (b)      the genuineness of all signatures,

         (c)      the legal capacity of natural persons,

         (d)      the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to us
                  as copies and the authenticity of the originals of such
                  copies,

         (e)      the accuracy as to factual matters of the representations and
                  warranties of the Companies contained in the Loan Documents,

         (f)      that the Financing Statements contain the current address of
                  the Lender from which information concerning the Lender's
                  security interest in the collateral

                  described in the Collateral Agreement (hereinafter, the
                  "Collateral") can be obtained, the correct organizational
                  numbers of the Companies, and current mailing addresses of the
                  Companies,

         (g)      that the Companies have rights in the Collateral,

         (h)      the due authorization of the Loan Documents by the parties
                  thereto, other than the Companies, and the execution and
                  delivery of the Loan Documents by the parties thereto,
                  including the Companies, and

         (i)      that the Loan Documents constitute the valid, binding and
                  enforceable obligations of the parties thereto, including the
                  Companies.

         Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as we have deemed
necessary, and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the
opinion that:

         1.       Formation and Existence.

         (a)      CI is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing
under the laws of the State of Washington, with corporate power to conduct any
lawful business activity.

         (b)      SBC is a limited liability company duly formed and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Washington, with organizational power to
conduct any lawful business activity.

         (c)      TI is a limited liability company duly formed and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Washington, with organizational power to
conduct any lawful business activity.

         2.       Each of the Companies has the organizational power to execute,
deliver and perform the Loan Documents executed by it, and has taken all
requisite organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of the Loan Documents executed by such Company.

         3.       Non-contravention.

         (a)      The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents
executed by CI and the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the
Loan Documents executed by CI will not violate or cause a breach of any
provision of the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws of CI.

         (b)      The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents
executed by SBC and the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the
Loan Documents executed by SBC will not violate or cause a breach of any
provision of the Certificate of Formation or Operating Agreement of SBC.

         (c)      The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents
executed by TI and the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the
Loan Documents executed by TI will not violate or cause a breach of any
provision of the Certificate of Formation or Operating Agreement of TI.

         4.       Under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in
the State of Washington, RCW 62A.9A-101, et seq. (the "Washington UCC" or
"UCC"), the Department of Licensing of the State of Washington is the proper
jurisdiction in which to file a financing statement to perfect the Collateral
Agent's security interest in the Collateral. The Financing Statements are
sufficient in form for filing with the Department of Licensing and, upon such
filings, will perfect the Collateral Agent's security interest in the Collateral
to the extent a security interest in the Collateral may be perfected under the
Washington UCC by filing financing statements in the Department of Licensing of
the State of Washington.

         5.       Based upon RCW Chapter 23B.02 and RCW 25.15.070 attached
hereto as Exhibit B, each of the Companies is a "registered organization" within
the meaning of 62A.9A-102(70) of the Washington UCC.


                                               SCOPE OF OPINION

         Our opinions set forth above are further subject to the following
additional qualifications:

         (a)      Our opinions expressed above are limited to the law of the
State of Washington.

         (b)      Our opinions are subject to the effect of bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, fraudulent transfer,
statutes of limitation, or other similar laws and judicial decisions affecting
or relating to the rights of creditors generally, and are further subject to the
effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts
of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, estoppel, election
of remedies and other similar doctrines affecting the enforcement of agreements
generally (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at
law or in equity). In addition, the availability of specific

performance, injunctive relief, the appointment of a receiver or other equitable
remedies is subject to the discretion of the tribunal before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought.

         (c)      Our opinions in paragraph 4, above, as to perfection of the
security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral, are further subject
to the following additional qualifications:

                  (i)      we express no opinion as to Collateral which consists
         of or will consist of consumer goods or accounts resulting from the
         sale thereof, beneficial interests in a trust or decedent's estate,
         deposit accounts, commercial tort claims, letters of credit or letter
         of credit rights, goods subject to certificates of title (including,
         without limitation, motor vehicles), equipment to be used in farming
         operations, farm products, agricultural or farm property, accounts or
         general intangibles arising from or relating to the sale of farm
         products, crops, timber, minerals, oil, gas or the like, or items which
         are subject to a statute or treaty of the United States which provides
         for a national or international certificate of title for the perfection
         of a security interest therein or which specifies a place of filing
         different from that specified in the Washington UCC for filing to
         perfect such security interest, or in the case of the sale of any of
         the foregoing, accounts, promissory notes or general intangibles
         arising with respect thereto;

                  (ii)     we express no opinion as to matters excluded from
         Article 9 of the Washington UCC by Section 62A.9A-109 of the UCC;

                  (iii)    the effect of Section 62A.9A.-315 of the Washington
         UCC as to proceeds of Collateral and Sections 62A.9A-320 and 62A.9A-330
         of the Washington UCC as to buyers and purchasers of Collateral in
         certain circumstances;

                  (iv)     the requirement that continuation statements with
         respect to the Financing Statements be filed within six months prior to
         the fifth, tenth, fifteenth, etc. anniversaries of the original filing
         of the Financing Statements;

                  (v)      the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the
         Collateral may become unperfected if the Companies changes its name,
         jurisdiction of formation or its status therein, or identity or entity
         structure;

                  (vi)     we express no opinion as to the validity or
perfection of any security interest purported to be granted in that portion of
the Collateral that constitutes an interest or claim in or under a policy of
insurance (except as provided in Section 62A.9A-315 of the Washington UCC with
respect to proceeds), a right represented by a judgment, a right

         represented by a judgment, a right of setoff, a claim arising out of
         tort or an interest in any deposit account (except as provided in
         Section 62A.9A-315 of the Washington UCC with respect to proceeds);

                  (vii)    in the case of Collateral consisting of money (as
         such term is defined in the Washington UCC) not constituting part of a
         chattel paper (as such term is defined in the Washington UCC), the
         security interest granted pursuant to the Collateral Agreement cannot
         be perfected by filing the Financing Statements but can only be
         perfected if possession thereof is obtained;

                  (viii)   we express no opinion with respect to the perfection
         of the Collateral Agent's security interest in any patents, patent
         applications, patents pending, copyrights, trademarks, trade names,
         trademark registrations or other interests subject to federal patent,
         trademark or copyright laws except to the extent a court of competent
         jurisdiction holds that Article 9A of the Washington UCC applies;

                  (ix)     we express no opinion concerning the Companies'
         rights in or title to any personal property; and

                  (x)      we express no opinion with respect to the priority,
         creation, validity or attachment of the security interest, but have
         assumed for purposes of the opinions set forth herein that such
         security interest is valid and has been created and has attached under
         the laws of the State of New York.

         (d)      We express no opinion as to compliance or the effect of
noncompliance by the Lender with any state or federal laws or regulations
applicable to the Lender in connection with the transactions described in the
Loan Documents.

         The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws
and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such

connection with the transaction described in the first paragraph of this letter,
may not be relied upon by the addressee hereof for any other purpose, and may
not be relied upon or used by, circulated, quoted, or referred to, nor may

of the Credit Agreement and such transferees may rely on it as if it were
addressed and delivered to them on the date of this opinion. We disclaim any
obligation to update this opinion letter for events occurring or coming to our

(each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, a "GRANTOR" and, collectively, the
"GRANTORS"), in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of May 23, 2002
(the "CREDIT AGREEMENT") among the Borrower, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JP

Co-Lead Arrangers, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent (the

institutions set forth on Schedule 2.01 of the Credit Agreement (each,
including JP Morgan, CSFB, and the Administrative Agent, a "LENDER" and,
collectively, the "LENDERS").

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the
respective meanings given such terms in the Credit Agreement. This opinion is
being delivered to you pursuant to subsection 4.01(b)(v) of the Credit
Agreement.

Our representation of the Grantors has been as special counsel for the purposes
stated above.

As to all matters of fact (including factual conclusions and characterizations
and descriptions of purpose, intention or other state of mind), we have relied,
with your permission, entirely upon the representations and warranties of the
Loan Parties set forth in the Credit Agreement and each of the other Loan
Documents.

In Connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies of the
following documents:

         (i)      the Credit Agreement; and

         (ii)     the Collateral Agreement.

The documents specified in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above are referred to
herein, collectively, as the "Loan Documents". This opinion is based entirely
on our review of the documents listed in the preceding paragraph, and we have
made no other documentary review or investigation of any kind whatsoever for
purposes of this opinion.

We have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the conformity to the
originals of all documents reviewed by us as copies, the authenticity and
completeness of all original documents reviewed by us in original or copy form
and the legal competence of each individual executing any document.

For purposes of this opinion, we have made such examination of law as we have
deemed necessary. We are attorneys admitted to practice in the State of New
York and this opinion is limited solely to the internal substantive laws of the
State of New York as applied by courts located in New York without regard to
choice of law, and we express no opinion as to the laws of any other
jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the federal laws of the United
States of America). We express no opinion as to any Federal or state tax,
antitrust, securities or blue sky law of any jurisdiction.

We note that the Credit Agreement and the Collateral Agreement contain
provisions stating that they are to be governed by the laws of the State of New
York (a "CHOSEN-LAW PROVISION").

Except to the extent that each such Chosen-Law Provision is made enforceable by
New York General Obligations Law Section 5-1401, as applied by a New York state
court or a federal court sitting in New York and applying New York choice of
law principles, no opinion is given herein as to any Chosen-Law Provision, or
otherwise as to the choice of law or internal substantive rules of law that any
court or other tribunal may apply to the transactions contemplated by the
Credit Agreement and the Collateral Agreement.

Our opinion is further subject to the following exceptions, qualifications and
assumptions, all of which we understand to be acceptable to you:

         (a)      We have assumed without any independent investigation that
                  each party to the Loan Documents (i) at all times relevant
                  thereto, is validly existing and in good standing under the
                  laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, and is
                  qualified to do business and in good standing under the laws
                  of each jurisdiction where such qualification is required
                  generally or necessary in order for such party to enforce its
                  fights under such Loan Documents, (ii) at all times relevant
                  thereto, had and has the full power, authority and legal
                  fight under its certificate of incorporation, partnership
                  agreement, by-laws, and other governing organizational
                  documents, and the applicable corporate, partnership, or
                  other enterprise legislation and other applicable laws, as
                  the case may be, to execute, deliver, and perform its
                  obligations under, the Loan Documents, and (iii) has duly
                  authorized, executed, and delivered each of the Loan
                  Documents to which it is a party.

         (b)      We have assumed without any independent investigation (i)
                  that each of the Grantors has received or will receive, upon
                  consummation of the Transactions, the agreed to and stated
                  consideration for the incurrence of the Obligations and other
                  obligations applicable to it under the terms of the Loan
                  Documents to which it is a party, and accordingly has
                  received or will receive "value" (as such term is used in
                  Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted and in
                  effect in the State of New York (the "NEW YORK UCC")) in
                  respect thereof, (ii) that each of the Credit Agreement and
                  the Collateral Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of
                  each party thereto other than the Grantors, and (iii) that
                  each of the Credit Agreement and the Collateral Agreement is
                  a valid and binding obligation of the Grantors to the extent
                  that laws other than those of the State of New York are
                  relevant thereto.

         (c)      The enforcement of any obligations of, or any security
                  interest granted by, any of the Grantors or any other Person,
                  whether under any of the Loan Documents or otherwise, may be
                  limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

                  moratorium, marshaling or other laws and rules of law
                  affecting the enforcement generally of creditors' rights and
                  remedies (including such as may deny giving effect to waivers
                  of debtors' or guarantors' rights); and we express no opinion
                  as to the status under any fraudulent conveyance laws or
                  fraudulent transfer laws of any of the obligations of, or any
                  security interest granted by, any of the Grantors or any
                  other Person, whether under any of the Loan Documents or
                  otherwise.

         (d)      We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any
                  particular provision of any Loan Document relating to
                  remedies after default. However, notwithstanding the
                  qualification set forth in this paragraph (d), in our
                  judgment, subject to the other exceptions, qualifications and
                  limitations set forth in this opinion and subject to the fact
                  that there may be economic consequences arising out of any
                  procedural or other delay, the possible unenforceability of
                  any particular provision of the Loan Documents as to remedies
                  after default does not render the provisions of the Loan
                  Documents, taken as a whole, inadequate for the practical
                  realization of the principal legal rights and benefits
                  contemplated by the Loan Documents.

         (e)      We express no opinion as to the availability of any specific
                  or equitable relief of any kind.

         (f)      The enforcement of any of your rights may in all cases be
                  subject to an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and
                  to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
                  enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in
                  equity) and, as to any of your rights to collateral security,
                  will be subject to a duty to act in a commercially reasonable
                  manner.

         (g)      We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any
                  particular provision of any Loan Document relating to or
                  constituting (i) waivers of rights to object to jurisdiction
                  or venue, consents to jurisdiction or venue, or waivers of
                  rights to (or methods of) service of process, except to the
                  extent that such waivers or consents are made enforceable by
                  New York General Obligations Law Section 5-1402, applied by a
                  New York state court, (ii) waivers of rights to trial by
                  jury, or other rights or benefits bestowed by operation of
                  law, (iii) waivers of any applicable defense, setoff,
                  recoupment or counterclaim, (iv) waivers or variations of
                  provisions which are not capable of waiver or variation under
                  Sections 1-102, 9-602, 9-603, or other applicable provisions
                  of the New York UCC, (v) provisions in the Loan Documents
                  rendered ineffective or unenforceable by Sections 2A-303,
                  9-406, 9-407, or 9408 of the New York UCC, (vi) exculpation
                  or exoneration clauses, indemnity clauses to the extent such
                  clauses may be held by any court to be contrary to public
                  policy and clauses relating to releases or

                  waivers of unmatured claims or rights, (vii) the imposition
                  or collection of interest on overdue interest or providing
                  for a penalty rate of interest or late charges on overdue or
                  defaulted obligations, or the payment of any amount which may
                  be held by any court to be a "penalty" or a "forfeiture", or
                  (viii) so-called "usury savings" clauses. We express no
                  opinion as to the effect of suretyship defenses, or defenses
                  in the nature thereof, with respect to the obligations of any
                  applicable guarantor, joint obligor, surety, accommodation
                  party, or other secondary obligor.

         (h)      We assume that at least $2,500,000 will be advanced to the
                  Borrower, in one or more installments, pursuant to the Loan
                  Documents. No opinion is given herein as to the usury laws,
                  or other laws regulating the maximum rate of interest which
                  may be charged, taken or received, of any jurisdiction other
                  than the State of New York.

         (i)      We note that, under the laws of the State of New York, the
                  remedies available in the State of New York for the
                  enforcement of the Loan Documents could be affected by any
                  failure of any Lender not organized in New York (i) to become
                  authorized, under Article 13 of the New York Business
                  Corporation Law, to do business in New York or (ii) to become
                  authorized, under Article 5 of the New York Banking Law, to
                  transact business in New York as a foreign banking
                  corporation. Further, no opinion is given herein as to any
                  other similar laws or requirements in any other jurisdiction.

         (j)      We express no opinion as to the effect of events occurring,
                  circumstances arising, or changes of law becoming effective
                  or occurring, after the date hereof on the matters addressed
                  in this opinion letter, and we assume no responsibility to
                  inform you of additional or changed facts, or changes in law,
                  of which we may become aware.

         (k)      We express no opinion as to the legality, the permitting or
                  licensing status or the zoning of any structure or any use of
                  any real estate, including without limitation compliance with
                  any environmental, hazardous materials, or safety law,
                  whether or not such real estate is subject to any security
                  interest or mortgage lien granted by any Grantor pursuant to
                  the Collateral Agreement.

         (1)      We have made no examination of, and no opinion is given
                  herein as to, any Grantor's title to or other ownership
                  rights in, the accuracy of the descriptions of, or the
                  existence of any lien, charge, encumbrance, restriction or
                  limitation on, or adverse claim against, any of the property
                  or assets of any Grantor. We have assumed, without any
                  independent investigation, that each Grantor has rights in

                  the Collateral and any other asset in which it purports to
                  grant a Security interest under the Collateral Agreement, and
                  that the Collateral Agreement creates a valid security
                  interest in such portion of the Collateral and any such other
                  asset in which a security interest may be created by contract
                  to secure the Obligations of such Grantor to the extent that
                  laws other than those of the State of New York are relevant
                  thereto. We express no opinion as to the priority (except to
                  the limited extent set forth in the final sentence of
                  paragraph 5 below) or (except to the extent specifically set
                  forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 below) the attachment, validity,
                  enforceability, or perfection of any security interest,
                  mortgage, or other lien or encumbrance with respect to any of
                  the property or assets of any Grantor. Further. we-express no
                  opinion as to any security interest in any Collateral or any
                  other asset excluded from, or not governed by, Article 9 of
                  the New York UCC. Our opinions in paragraph 4 below are
                  limited to Article 9 of the New York UCC; and our opinions in
                  paragraph 5 below are limited to Articles 8 and 9 of the New
                  York UCC. We call your attention to the following:

                           (i)      there exist certain limitations, resulting
                                    from the operation of Section 9-315 of the
                                    New York UCC, on the attachment and
                                    perfection of any security interest in
                                    proceeds of collateral, such that further
                                    action (in or out of New York) may be
                                    necessary to maintain the attachment or
                                    perfection of such interests;

                           (ii)     under Sections 9-320. 9-321.9-330, and
                                    9-331 of the New York UCC, purchasers,
                                    licensees, or lessees of certain types of
                                    collateral may take the same free of a
                                    perfected security interest; and, to the
                                    extent that "transferable records" (as that

                                    collateral, certain persons in "control"

                                    such transferable records may take them
                                    free of a perfected security interest;

                           (iii)    Section 552 of the federal Bankruptcy Code
                                    limits the extent to which property
                                    acquired by a debtor after the commencement
                                    of a case under the Bankruptcy Code may be
                                    subject to a security interest resulting
                                    from any security agreement entered into by
                                    the debtor before the commencement of the
                                    case; and under Section 547 of the
                                    Bankruptcy Code, a security interest that
                                    is deemed transferred within the relevant
                                    period set forth in Section 547(b)(4)

                                    agencies or officers, except to the extent
                                    provided in Sections 2A-303, 9-406, 9-407,

                                    the Collateral Agent, or any other person
                                    or entity, may be a protected purchaser (as
                                    defined in Section 8-303 of the New York
                                    UCC) with respect to any securities
                                    included within the Collateral other than
                                    as set forth in paragraph 5 below; and we
                                    point out that, under Section 8-110(c) of
                                    the New York UCC, the local law of the

                                    Securities (as defined in the Collateral
                                    Agreement) are delivered to the Collateral

                                    respect thereto may be asserted against the

                           (vi)     we assume that the Pledged Securities
                                    constitute "certificated securities"
                                    (within the meaning given such term in
                                    Section 8-102(a)(4) of the New York UCC);

                                    the Collateral Agent, or any other person
                                    or entity, may be a "holder in due course"
                                    (as defined in Section 3-302 of the New
                                    York UCC) of any applicable negotiable
                                    instrument, or a holder to whom any
                                    applicable negotiable document of title has
                                    been duly negotiated;

                           (viii)   any security interest in the Collateral may
                                    be subject to the limitations set forth in
                                    Sections 9-404, 9-405, and 9-408 of the
                                    applicable UCC;

                           (ix)     we have assumed that the Collateral dogs
                                    not include any "commercial tort claims"
                                    (as such term is defined in Article 9 of
                                    the New York UCC); and

                           (x)      the rights of the Collateral Agent and the
                                    Lenders with respect to collateral
                                    consisting of obligations as to which a
                                    governmental or similar entity is the
                                    account debtor or other obligor may be
                                    subject to compliance by the Collateral
                                    Agent and the Lenders with the Federal
                                    Assignment of Claims Act or similar Federal
                                    or state laws.

Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations and qualifications set
forth below, we are of the opinion that:

1.       Each Loan Document to which a Grantor is a party constitutes the
         legal, valid and binding obligation of such Grantor, enforceable
         against such Grantor in accordance with its terms.

2.       The execution, delivery and performance by each Grantor of each of the
         Loan Documents to which it is a party will not violate any law,
         statute, rule or regulation of the State of New York applicable to
         such Grantor.

3.       No consent, authorization or approval by, or any notification of,
         declaration to, or filing or registration with, any court, public body
         or authority of the State of New York is required under any law,
         statute, rule or regulation of the State of New York to be obtained or
         effected by any Grantor in connection with the execution, delivery and
         performance by such Grantor of each of the Loan Documents to which it
         is a party except for filings or recordings that may be necessary to
         create, record or perfect, or maintain the perfection of, or (with
         respect to any applicable Pledged Securities) to enforce the security
         interests contemplated by the Collateral Agreement.

4.       The provisions of the Collateral Agreement are effective under the New
         York UCC to create a valid, security interest in favor of the
         Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties (as defined
         in the Collateral Agreement), in all right, title and interest of each
         of the Grantors party to the Collateral Agreement in those items and
         types of Collateral described in the Collateral Agreement to which
         Article 9 of the New York UCC is applicable.

5.       The Collateral Agreement, together with the delivery (within the
         meaning given such term by the New York UCC) to the Collateral Agent,
         within the State of New York, of each of the stock certificates or
         other security certificates (within the meaning given such term by the
         New York UCC) representing the Pledged Securities set forth on
         SCHEDULE II to the Collateral Agreement, creates in favor of the
         Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a perfected
         security interest under the New York UCC in the Pledged Securities.
         Assuming that each Pledged Security delivered to the Collateral Agent
         is in bearer form or is indorsed in blank or is registered in the name
         of the

         Collateral Agent and that at the time of such delivery the
         Collateral Agent does not have notice (as such term is used in Article
         8 of the New York UCC) of any adverse claim (as such term is used in
         Article 8 of the New York UCC), the Collateral Agent will acquire its
         security interest in such Pledged Security, for the benefit of the
         Secured Parties, free of adverse claims.

the-Loan Documents and may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or
furnished or referred to, or relied upon, by any other person or entity (other

("CII") and wholly owned subsidiary of the Borrower, in connection with that
certain Credit Agreement dated as of May 23, 2002 (the "Credit Agreement") among
the Borrower, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPMorgan") and Credit Suisse First
Boston ("CSFB"), as Joint Bookrunners and Co-Lead Arrangers, and JPMorgan Chase
Bank (the "Collateral Agent"), as Collateral Agent for the financial
institutions set forth in the Credit Agreement on Schedule 2.01 (each, including
the Lenders described in the Credit Agreement, JPMorgan, CSFB , and the
Collateral Agent, are referred to herein individually as a "Lender" and
collectively as "Lenders"). This opinion is being delivered with respect to the
CII pursuant to subsection 4.01(b) of the Credit Agreement.

         Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meanings as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and, if not defined
therein, as set forth in the Collateral Agreement (as such agreement is defined
below). As used herein:

         (a) "UCC" means the Delaware UCC (as such term is defined below).

         (b) "UCC Delaware Filing Collateral" means that portion of the Article
9 Collateral (as such term is defined in the Collateral Agreement) in which a
security interest may be perfected by filing a financing statement under the
Delaware UCC.

         (c) "Delaware UCC" means the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect on
the date hereof in the State of Delaware (without regard to laws referenced in
Section 9-201 thereof) codified at 9 Del. C. ss.ss. 9-101 et seq.

         We are licensed to practice law only in the State of Delaware;
therefore, this letter of opinion is limited in all respects to the laws of the
State of Delaware. No opinion is being expressed with respect to any matter
which may arise under the laws of any other jurisdiction or any effect which
such laws might have on the opinions herein set forth.

         In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals, or copies
identified to our satisfaction as being true copies, of such records, documents
or other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable
us to render the opinions expressed below, including, without limitation, a
certified copy of the organization documents identified on Schedule 1 and a good
standing certificate dated May 21, 2002 issued by the Office of the Delaware
Secretary of State as to CII's existence in the State of Delaware (collectively,
the "Organization Documents"). We have also reviewed the following documents:

         (a) The Credit Agreement dated as of the date of this letter;

         (b) The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the "Collateral Agreement")
dated as of the date of this letter;

         (c) An unfiled copy of a financing statement identifying CII as debtor,
and "JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Collateral Agent", as secured party, which we
understand will be filed within ten (10) days of the transfer of the security
interest in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Filing Office" and such financing statement, the "Financing Statement").

         The documents referenced in items (a) through (c) above are
collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents." The documents
referenced in items (b) and (c) above are collectively referred to herein as the
"Collateral Documents."

         In examining the above documents, we have assumed the genuineness of
all signatures, the authenticity of all documents purporting to be originals and
the conformity to the originals of all documents purporting to be copies.

         With respect to matters of fact, we have assumed, without undertaking
to verify such facts by independent investigation, the accuracy, as of the date
of this letter as well as the date made, of the Secretary of State's
Certificate, and have relied upon all representations and warranties in the Loan
Documents and the accuracy of all certificates of officers of Borrower, officers
of CII, of public officials and of others.

         Except with respect to CII, we also have assumed, for purposes of the
opinions herein expressed, without any inquiry or other investigation, that each
party to the Loan Documents (i) is duly incorporated or otherwise duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation; (ii) has all requisite power and authority to
execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under the Loan Documents and each
of the other documents and agreements executed by it with respect to the
transactions contemplated thereby to which such Persons are parties; and (iii)
has duly authorized, executed and delivered each of the Loan Documents to which
it is a party. We have also assumed, for purposes of the opinions herein
expressed, without any inquiry or other investigation, that with respect to each
party to the Loan Documents, including without limitation, CII, the Loan

Documents constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party
thereto, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

         We have also assumed, without inquiry or other information, that (i)
the information contained in the Financing Statement is accurate; (ii) CII is
not organized under the laws of any state other than the State of Delaware or
under the laws of the United States; and (iii) CII is not required to register
as an "investment company" and is not controlled by an "investment company"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, nor is CII
a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company" within the
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         We note that we have delivered to you our opinion with respect to CII's
status as a "registered organization." Except to the extent that this
determination is an element of your choice of law analysis, we express no
opinion with respect to the choice of law governing perfection, the effect of
perfection and non-perfection or priority of the security interest created
pursuant to the Collateral Documents.

         We express no opinion with respect to the priority, validity or
attachment of the security interest, but have assumed for purposes of the
opinions set forth herein that such security interest is validly created and has
attached pursuant to the Loan Documents under the laws of the State of New York.

         We also express no opinion as to the title of CII to any of the UCC
Delaware Filing Collateral and we note that with respect to any after acquired
property, the security interest perfected by the Financing Statements will not
attach until CII acquires ownership of such after acquired property.

         Further, the opinions expressed herein are subject to, limited and
qualified by, (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, moratorium, marshaling, arrangement, assignment for benefit of
creditors, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance or other statute, rule,
regulation or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally (heretofore
or hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable) regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law, or (ii) any
general principle of equity, whether applied by a court of law or equity
(including, but not limited to, any principle (a) governing the availability of
discretion of a court, (b) affording any equitable defense, (c) requiring good
faith, fair dealing and reasonableness in the performance and enforcement of a
contract by a party

seeking the enforcement of such contract, (d) requiring consideration of the
materiality of a breach of a contract by a party against whom or which the
enforcement of such contract is sought and consideration of the consequences of
such breach to a party seeking such enforcement, (e) requiring consideration at
the time the enforcement of a contract is attempted of the impracticality or
impossibility of the performance of such contract, or (f) affording any defense
to the enforcement of a contract based upon the unconscionability of the conduct
after such contract has been entered into of a party seeing such enforcement).

         Based upon and subject to all qualifications, conditions, limitations,
exceptions and assumptions set forth in this letter, we are of the opinion that,
as of the date hereof:

         (1) CII is a corporation duly existing and in good standing in the
State of Delaware.

         (2) The execution and delivery by CII of the Loan Documents and its
compliance with the terms and conditions thereof, to the extent to which it is a
party thereto, do not conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of CII.

         (3) The Loan Documents have been duly authorized by CII, and when
executed and delivered by CII, shall have been duly executed and delivered by
CII to the extent it is a party thereto.

         (4) Pursuant to the Collateral Agreement, CII has authorized for
purposes of Section 9-509 of the Delaware UCC the filing of the Financing
Statement naming CII as debtor.

         (5) The Financing Statements includes not only all of the types of
information required by Section 9-502(a) of the Delaware UCC but also the types
of information without which the Filing Office may refuse to accept the
Financing Statements pursuant to Section 9-516 of the Delaware UCC.

         (6) Under the Delaware UCC, to the extent the Delaware UCC is
applicable, the security interest of the Collateral Agent will be perfected in
CII's rights in all UCC Delaware Filing Collateral as to which perfection can be
obtained by filing of a financing statement upon the later of the attachment of
the security interest and the filing of the Financing Statements in the Filing
Office and the payment of applicable filing fees; provided, however, we express
no

opinion, with respect to (i) any security interests in trademarks, patents
and copyrights, except to the extent Article 9 of the Delaware UCC may be
applicable to the foregoing, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, we express no opinion as to the effect of any federal laws relating
to trademarks, patents and copyrights or other intellectual property on the
opinions expressed herein, (ii) money, (iii) deposit accounts, (iv) letter of
credit rights (v) goods covered by a certificate of title statute, (vi)
as-extracted collateral and timber to be cut, (vii) real property or interests
in real property or goods which are, or are to become fixtures, (viii) any
property subject to a statute, regulation or treaty of the United States whose
requirements for a security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a
lien creditor with respect to the property preempt Section 9-310(a) of the
Delaware UCC, (ix) any goods subject to a negotiable document of title; (x)
commercial tort claims; or (xi) any goods which are accessions to, or commingled
or processed with, other goods to the extent that the security interest is
limited by Section 9-335 or 9-336 of the Delaware UCC. In the case of property
which becomes UCC Delaware Filing Collateral after the date hereof, Section 552
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code limits the extent to which property acquired by a
debtor after the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code may be
subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement entered into by
the debtor before the commencement of such case.

         (7) You have asked whether CII is a "registered organization" as
defined in the Delaware UCC. The Secretary of State of Delaware is required to
maintain a public record showing CII to have been organized. Based on our review
of the Organization Documents, we are of the opinion that CII is a "registered
organization" as defined in the Delaware UCC.

         We call to your attention the fact that the perfection of the above
security interests in the Delaware UCC Filing Collateral will be terminated or
the effectiveness thereof will lapse (i) as to any UCC Delaware Filing
Collateral acquired by CII more than four months after CII changes its name,
identity or corporate structure so as to make the Financing Statements seriously
misleading, unless a new appropriate financing statement indicating the new
name, identity or corporate structure of such Subsidiary is properly filed
before the expiration of such four months; and (ii) as to all such UCC Delaware
Filing Collateral, five years after the date of the original filing unless a
continuation statement is filed within the period of six months prior to the
expiration of such five years.

         The foregoing opinions are subject to the qualification that we express
no opinion as the creation, validity, attachment or perfection of the security
interest created by the Collateral Documents insofar as they are not governed by
Article 9 of the Delaware UCC.

                                    Guarantee


                                       5
<PAGE>

         SECTION 2.01 Guarantee. Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees,
jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not
merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment and performance of the
Obligations. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the Obligations may be
extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent
from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any
extension or renewal of any Obligation. Each of the Guarantors waives
presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Borrower or any other
Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of
its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.

         SECTION 2.02 Guarantee of Payment. Each of the Guarantors further
agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due
and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by
the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to any security held for the
payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on
the books of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of the
Borrower or any other Person.

         SECTION 2.03 No Limitations, Etc. (a) Except for termination of a
Guarantor's obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 7.15, the
obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction,
limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of
waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject
to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by
reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or
otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of
each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise
affected by (i) the failure of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party
to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the
provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any rescission, waiver,
amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions
of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any
other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iii) the release of any security held by
the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party for the Obligations or any of
them; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the
performance of the Obligations; or (v) any other act or omission that may or
might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise
operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than
the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations). Each Guarantor
expressly authorizes the Secured Parties to take and hold security for the
payment and performance of the Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or
all such security (with or without consideration), to enforce or apply such
security and direct the order and manner of any sale thereof in their sole
discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or
obligors upon or in respect of the Obligations, all without affecting the
obligations of any Guarantor hereunder.

         (b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor
waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or any
other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof
from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower
or any other Loan Party,


                                       6
<PAGE>

other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. The
Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose
on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or
nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of
foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other
accommodation with the Borrower or any other Loan Party or exercise any other
right or remedy available to them against the Borrower or any other Loan Party,
without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor
hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully and indefeasibly
paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each
Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such
election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any
right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor
against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, as the case may be, or any
security.

         SECTION 2.04 Reinstatement. Each of the Guarantors agrees that its
guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Collateral Agent or any other
Secured Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, any other
Loan Party or otherwise.

         SECTION 2.05 Agreement To Pay; Subrogation. In furtherance of the
foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Collateral Agent or
any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue
hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to pay any
Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by
acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby
promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Collateral Agent
for distribution to the applicable Secured Parties in cash the amount of such
unpaid Obligation. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Collateral
Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower or
any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation,
contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be
subject to Article VI.

         SECTION 2.06 Information. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for
being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's and each other Loan Party's
financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the
risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the
risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of
the Collateral Agent or the other Secured Parties will have any duty to advise
such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such
circumstances or risks.

                                  ARTICLE III

                              Pledge of Securities

         SECTION 3.01 Pledge. As collateral security for the prompt and complete
payment or performance, as the case may be, in full of the Obligations, whether


                                       7
<PAGE>

at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or
otherwise, each Pledgor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, its successors
and assigns, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a security interest
and continuing lien in all of such Pledgor's right, title and interest in, to
and under (a) all shares of capital stock and other Equity Interests owned by
it, including, without limitation, all Equity Interests listed on Schedule II
and any other Equity Interests obtained in the future by such Pledgor and the
certificates representing all such Equity Interests (the "Pledged Stock");
provided that the Pledged Stock shall not include (i) any Equity Interests of
any non-wholly owned Foreign Subsidiary owned by such Pledgor, (ii) more than
65% of the Equity Interests of any wholly owned Foreign Subsidiary, and (iii)
Equity Interests of non-wholly owned Subsidiaries not required to be pledged
pursuant to Section 5.11 of the Credit Agreement (it being understood that such
Equity Interests may be subject to restrictions); (b)(i) all debt securities
issued to such Pledgor including, without limitation, all debt securities listed
opposite the name of such Pledgor on Schedule II, (ii) any debt securities in
the future issued to such Pledgor and (iii) the promissory notes and any other
instruments evidencing such debt securities (the "Pledged Debt Securities"); (c)
all payments of principal or interest, dividends, cash, instruments and other
property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in
respect of, in exchange for or upon the conversion of, and all other Proceeds
received in respect of, the Pledged Stock and Pledged Debt Securities referred
to in clauses (a) and (b) above; (d) all rights and privileges of such Pledgor
with respect to the Pledged Stock, Pledged Debt Securities and other property
referred to in clauses (a), (b), and (c) above; and (e) all Proceeds of any of
the foregoing (the items referred to in clauses (a) through (e) above being
collectively referred to as the "Pledged Collateral").

         TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Pledged Collateral, together with all right,
title, interest, powers, privileges and preferences pertaining or incidental
thereto, unto the Collateral Agent, its successors and assigns, for the ratable
benefit of the Secured Parties, forever; subject, however, to the terms,
covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth.

     SECTION 3.02 Delivery of the Pledged Collateral. (a) Each Pledgor agrees
promptly to deliver or cause to be delivered to the Collateral Agent any and all
Pledged Securities.

     (b) Each Pledgor will cause any Indebtedness for borrowed money owed to
such Pledgor by the Borrower or any Subsidiary to be evidenced by a duly
executed promissory note that is pledged and delivered to the Collateral Agent
pursuant to the terms hereof.

     (c) Upon delivery to the Collateral Agent, (i) any Pledged Securities shall
be accompanied by stock powers duly indorsed in blank by an "effective
indorsement" (as defined in Section 8-107 of the UCC) or other instruments of
transfer satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and by such other instruments and
documents as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request and (ii) all other
property comprising part of the Pledged Collateral shall be accompanied by
proper instruments of assignment duly executed by the applicable Pledgor and
such other instruments or documents as the Collateral Agent may reasonably
request. The initial Pledged Securities are described on Schedule II


                                       8

hereto. Each delivery of Pledged Securities after the date hereof shall be
accompanied by a schedule describing the additional securities, which schedule
shall supplement Schedule II and be made a part thereof; provided that failure
to attach any such schedule hereto shall not affect the validity of such pledge
of such Pledged Securities. Each schedule so delivered shall supplement any
prior schedules so delivered.

         SECTION 3.03 Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The Pledgors
jointly and severally represent, warrant and covenant to and with the Collateral
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, that:

         (a) Schedule II as amended from time to time in accordance with this
Agreement correctly sets forth the percentage of the issued and outstanding
shares of each class of the Equity Interests of the issuer thereof represented
by such Pledged Securities and includes all Equity Interests, debt securities
and promissory notes required to be pledged hereunder in order to satisfy the
Collateral and Guarantee Requirement;

         (b) the Pledged Stock and Pledged Debt Securities have been duly and
validly authorized and issued by the issuers thereof and (i) in the case of
Pledged Stock, are fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) in the case of Pledged
Debt Securities, are legal, valid and binding obligations of the issuers
thereof;

         (c) except for the security interests granted hereunder or in any other
Loan Document, each of the Pledgors (i) is and, subject to any transfers made in
compliance with the Credit Agreement, will continue to be the direct owner,
beneficially and of record, of the Pledged Securities indicated on Schedule II
as owned by such Pledgor, (ii) holds the same free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Encumbrances), (iii) will make no assignment, pledge,
hypothecation or transfer of, or create or permit to exist any security interest
in or other Lien on, the Pledged Collateral, other than Liens created by this
Agreement, Permitted Encumbrances and transfers made in compliance with the
Credit Agreement, and (iv) subject to Section 3.06, will cause any and all
Pledged Collateral, whether for value paid by the Pledgor or otherwise, to be
forthwith deposited with the Collateral Agent and pledged or assigned hereunder;

         (d) except for restrictions and limitations imposed by the Loan
Documents or securities laws generally or by the constituent documents of any
non-wholly owned Subsidiary, the Pledged Collateral is and will continue to be
freely transferable and assignable, and none of the Pledged Collateral is or
will be subject to any option, right of first refusal, shareholders agreement,
charter or by-law provisions or contractual restriction of any nature that might
prohibit, impair, delay or otherwise affect the pledge of such Pledged
Collateral hereunder, the sale or disposition thereof pursuant hereto or the
exercise by the Collateral Agent of rights and remedies hereunder;

     (e) each of the Pledgors (i) has the power and authority to pledge the
Pledged Collateral pledged by it hereunder in the manner hereby done or
contemplated and (ii) will defend its title or interest thereto or therein
against any and all Liens (other than the Lien created by this Agreement and
Permitted Encumbrances), however arising, of all Persons whomsoever;


                                       9
<PAGE>

         (f) by virtue of the execution and delivery by the Pledgors of this
Agreement, when any Pledged Securities are delivered to the Collateral Agent in
accordance with this Agreement, the Collateral Agent will obtain a legal, valid
and perfected first priority lien upon and security interest in such Pledged
Securities as security for the payment and performance of the Obligations,
subject to no other Lien other than as permitted under Section 6.02 of the
Credit Agreement; and

         (g) the pledge effected hereby is effective to vest in the Collateral
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, the rights of the
Collateral Agent in the Pledged Collateral as set forth herein.

         SECTION 3.04 Certification of Limited Liability Company and Limited
Partnership Interests. No interest in any limited liability company or limited
partnership controlled by any Grantor and pledged hereunder is represented by a
certificate, or is deemed a "security" within the meaning of Article 8 of the
UCC. In the event that any of the interests in any limited liability company or
limited partnership controlled by any Grantor on the date hereof become
represented by a certificate or certificates at any time in the future, such
Grantor shall deliver to the Collateral Agent any such certificates on or prior
to the third Business Day after which such interests become represented by a
certificate or certificates.

         SECTION 3.05 Registration in Nominee Name; Denominations. The
Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, shall have the right (in its
sole and absolute discretion) to hold the Pledged Securities in its own name as
pledgee, the name of its nominee (as pledgee or as sub-agent) or the name of the
applicable Pledgor, endorsed or assigned in blank or in favor of the Collateral
Agent. Each Pledgor will promptly give to the Collateral Agent copies of any
notices or other communications received by it with respect to Pledged
Securities registered in the name of such Pledgor. The Collateral Agent shall at
all times have the right to exchange the certificates representing Pledged
Securities for certificates of smaller or larger denominations for any purpose
consistent with this Agreement. Collateral Agent shall have the right with
Borrower's consent to appoint any Financial Officer of Borrower as a "Custodial
Agent" to hold any Pledged Collateral as an agent of and on behalf of Collateral
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, pursuant to a custodial agreement
reasonably acceptable to Collateral Agent and Borrower.

         SECTION 3.06 Voting Rights; Dividends and Interest, etc. (a) Unless and
until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

                  (i) Each Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all
         voting and/or other consensual rights and powers inuring to an owner of
         Pledged Securities or any part thereof for any purpose consistent with
         the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
         Documents; provided that such rights and powers shall not be exercised
         in any manner that would reasonably be expected to materially and
         adversely affect the rights inuring to a holder of any Pledged
         Securities or the rights and remedies of any of the Collateral Agent or
         the other Secured Parties under


                                       10
<PAGE>

         this Agreement or the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or
         the ability of the Secured Parties to exercise the same.

                  (ii) The Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to each
         Pledgor, or cause to be executed and delivered to such Pledgor, all
         such proxies, powers of attorney and other instruments as such Pledgor
         may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Pledgor to
         exercise the voting and/or consensual rights and powers it is entitled
         to exercise pursuant to subparagraph (i) above.

                  (iii) Each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain any
         and all ordinary cash dividends, interest, principal and other
         distributions paid on or distributed in respect of the Pledged
         Securities to the extent and only to the extent that such dividends,
         interest, principal and other distributions are paid in the normal
         course of the business of the issuer and all scheduled payments of
         interest, permitted by, and otherwise paid or distributed in accordance
         with, the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, the Loan
         Documents and applicable laws; provided that any noncash dividends,
         interest, principal or other distributions that would constitute
         Pledged Stock or Pledged Debt Securities, whether resulting from a
         subdivision, combination or reclassification of the outstanding Equity
         Interests of the issuer of any Pledged Securities or received in
         exchange for Pledged Securities or any part thereof, or in redemption
         thereof, or as a result of any merger, consolidation, acquisition or
         other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or
         otherwise, shall be and become part of the Pledged Collateral without
         further action, and, if received by any Pledgor, such Pledgor shall
         immediately take all steps, if any, necessary or advisable to ensure
         the validity, perfection, priority and, if applicable, control of the
         Collateral Agent over such Pledged Collateral, and pending any such
         action, such Pledgor shall hold such dividends, interest, principal or
         other distributions in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent,
         and shall forthwith deliver to the Collateral Agent, in the same form
         as so received (with any necessary indorsement) such Pledged
         Collateral.

         (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, all rights of any Pledgor to dividends, interest, principal or other
distributions that such Pledgor is authorized to receive pursuant to paragraph
(a)(iii) of this Section 3.06 shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon
become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive
right and authority to receive and retain such dividends, interest, principal or
other distributions. All dividends, interest, principal or other distributions
received by any Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall be
held in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall be forthwith
delivered to the Collateral Agent in the same form as so received (with any
necessary indorsement). Any and all money and other property paid over to or
received by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
(b) shall be retained by the Collateral Agent in an account to be established by
the Collateral Agent


                                       11
<PAGE>

upon receipt of such money or other property and shall be applied in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5.02. After all Events of Default have been cured
or waived and the applicable Pledgor or Pledgors have delivered to the
Collateral Agent certificates to that effect, the Collateral Agent shall,
promptly after all such Events of Default have been cured or waived, repay to
each Pledgor (without interest) all dividends, interest, principal or other
distributions that such Pledgor would otherwise be permitted to retain pursuant
to the terms of paragraph (a)(iii) of this Section 3.06 and that remain in such
account.

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
all rights of any Pledgor to exercise the voting and consensual rights and
powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this Section
3.06, and the obligations of the Collateral Agent under paragraph (a)(ii) of
this Section 3.06, shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become
vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right
and authority to exercise such voting and consensual rights and powers; provided
that, unless otherwise directed by the Required Lenders, the Collateral Agent
shall have the right from time to time following and during the continuance of
an Event of Default to permit the Pledgors to exercise such rights.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     Security Interests in Personal Property

         SECTION 4.01 Security Interest. (a) As collateral security for the
prompt and complete payment or performance, as the case may be, in full of the
Obligations, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration,
acceleration, demand or otherwise, each Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral
Agent, its successors and assigns, for the ratable benefit of the Secured
Parties, a security interest and continuing lien (the "Security Interest") in
all right, title or interest in, to and under all personal property of such
Grantor, including, but not limited to, the following assets and properties now
owned or existing or at any time hereafter arising or acquired by such Grantor
or in which such Grantor now has or at any time in the future may acquire any
right, title or interest and wherever the same may be located (collectively, the

         (i) all Accounts;

         (ii) all Chattel Paper;

         (iii) all Deposit Accounts;

         (iv) all Documents;

         (v) all Equipment;

         (vi) all General Intangibles;

         (vii) all Instruments;


                                       12
<PAGE>

         (viii) all Insurance;

         (ix) all Inventory;

         (x) all Investment Property;

         (xi) all Letter-of-Credit Rights;

         (xii) all Money;

         (xiii) all Commercial Tort Claims;

         (xiv) to the extent not otherwise included above, all Collateral
Records, Collateral Support and Supporting Obligations relating to any of the
foregoing; and

         (xv) to the extent not otherwise included, all Proceeds and products of
any and all of the foregoing and all collateral security and guarantees given by
any Person with respect to any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Article 9 Collateral" shall not include
(i) any Equity  Interests of any non-wholly  owned Foreign  Subsidiary  owned by
such  Grantor,  (ii) more than 65% of the Equity  Interests  of any wholly owned
Foreign Subsidiary,  (iii) Equity Interests of non-wholly owned Subsidiaries not
required to be pledged  pursuant  to Section  5.11 of the Credit  Agreement  (it
being  understood  that such Equity  Interests may be subject to  restrictions),
(iv) any of Grantor's  rights or interests  in any lease,  license,  contract or
agreement to which a Grantor is a party to the extent that a grant of a Security
Interest,  encumbrance or pledge under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
would result in a breach of or default  under,  the terms or  provisions  of any
such lease,  license,  contract or agreement  (other than to the extent that any
such term would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408
or 9-409 of the UCC (or any successor  provision or  provisions) of any relevant
jurisdiction or any other applicable law) .

         (b) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent at
any time and from time to time to file in any relevant jurisdiction and with any
filing office any initial financing statements (including fixture filings) and
amendments thereto that contain the information required by Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code of each applicable jurisdiction for the filing of any
financing statement or amendment, including but not limited to (a) whether such
Grantor is an organization, the type of organization and any organizational
identification number issued to such Grantor, (b) in the case of a financing
statement filed as a fixture filing or covering Article 9 Collateral
constituting minerals or the like to be extracted or timber to be cut, a
sufficient description of the real property to which such Article 9 Collateral
relates and (c) a collateral description describing the collateral in the same
manner described in this agreement or describing the collateral in any other
manner as the Collateral Agent may determine, in its sole discretion, is
necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of the security
interest in the collateral granted to the Collateral Agent in


                                       13
<PAGE>

connection herewith, including, without limitation, describing such property as
"all assets" or "all personal property," whether now owned or existing or at any
time hereafter arising or acquired. Each Grantor agrees to provide such
information to the Collateral Agent promptly upon request.

         Each Grantor also ratifies its authorization for the Collateral Agent
to file in any relevant jurisdiction and with any filing office any initial
financing statements or amendments thereto if filed prior to the date hereof.

         The Collateral Agent is further authorized to file with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office or United States Copyright Office (or any
successor office or any similar office in any other country) such documents as
may be necessary or advisable for the purpose of perfecting, confirming,
continuing, enforcing or protecting the Security Interest granted by each
Grantor, without the signature of any Grantor, and naming any Grantor or the
Grantors as debtors and the Collateral Agent as secured party.

         (c) The Security Interest is granted as security only and shall not
subject the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to, or in any way alter
or modify, any obligation or liability of any Grantor with respect to or arising
out of the Article 9 Collateral.

         (d) Until the occurrence of a Default, Grantor may use or consume in
the ordinary course of its business any proceeds of Pledged Collateral to the
extent not prohibited by the Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 4.02 Representations and Warranties. In addition to the
representations and warranties made in Section 3 above with respect to the
Pledged Collateral, the Grantors jointly and severally represent and warrant to
the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties that:

                  (a) Except as otherwise permitted in the Credit Agreement,
         each Grantor owns and has good and valid right, title and interest in
         and to the Article 9 Collateral with respect to which it has purported
         to grant a Security Interest hereunder, is aware of no challenges to
         the title with respect to Article 9 Collateral and has full power and
         authority to grant to the Collateral Agent the Security Interest in
         such Article 9 Collateral pursuant hereto and to execute, deliver and
         perform its obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
         without the consent or approval of any other Person other than any
         consent or approval that has been obtained.

                  (b) The Perfection Certificate has been duly prepared,
         completed and executed and the information set forth therein, including
         but not limited to, the exact legal name of such Grantor, the type of
         organization of such Grantor and the jurisdiction of organization of
         such Grantor, is correct and complete in all material respects as of
         the Effective Date. Each Grantor further represents that (i) it has
         been duly organized as an entity of the type as set forth in the
         Perfection Certificate solely under the laws of the jurisdiction as set
         forth in the Perfection


                                       14
<PAGE>

         Certificate and remains duly existing as such and (ii) it has not filed
         any certificates of domestication, transfer or continuance in any other
         jurisdiction.

                  (c) Except as otherwise permitted in the Credit Agreement, it
         has not within the last five (5) years become bound (whether as a
         result of merger or otherwise) as debtor, either by contract, by
         operation of law, or by a security agreement previously entered into by
         another Person, which has not heretofore been terminated.

                  (d) None of the Account Debtors in respect of any Accounts is
         the government of the United States, any agency or instrumentality
         thereof, any state or municipality or any foreign sovereign. No Account
         requires the consent of the Account Debtor in respect thereof in
         connection with the pledge hereunder, except any consent which has been
         obtained.

                  (e) Authorized Uniform Commercial Code financing statements
         (including fixture filings, as applicable) or other appropriate
         filings, recordings or registrations containing a description of the
         Article 9 Collateral have been delivered to the Collateral Agent for
         filing in each governmental, municipal or other office specified in
         Schedule VI hereto (or specified by notice from the Borrower to the
         Collateral Agent after the Effective Date in the case of filings,
         recordings or registrations required by Section 5.10 or 5.11 of the
         Credit Agreement), which are all the filings, recordings and
         registrations (other than filings required to be made in the United
         States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright
         Office in order to perfect the Security Interest in Article 9
         Collateral consisting of United States Patents, Trademarks and
         Copyrights) that are necessary to publish notice of and protect the
         validity of and to establish a legal, valid and perfected security
         interest in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the ratable benefit of
         the Secured Parties) in respect of all Article 9 Collateral in which
         the Security Interest may be perfected by filing, recording or
         registration in the United States (or any political subdivision
         thereof) and its territories and possessions, and no further or
         subsequent filing, refiling, recording, rerecording, registration or
         reregistration is necessary in any such jurisdiction, except as
         provided under applicable law with respect to the filing of
         continuation statements.

                  (f) Each Grantor shall ensure that a fully executed agreement
         in the form hereof and containing a description of all Article 9
         Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property shall have been received
         and recorded within three months after the execution of this Agreement
         with respect to United States Patents and United States registered
         Trademarks (and Trademarks for which United States registration
         applications are pending) and within one month after the execution of
         this Agreement with respect to United States registered Copyrights by
         the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States
         Copyright Office pursuant to 35 U.S.C.ss. 261, 15 U.S.C.ss. 1060 or 17
         U.S.C.ss. 205 and the regulations thereunder, as applicable, to protect
         the validity of and to establish a legal, valid and perfected security
         interest in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the


                                       15
<PAGE>

         ratable benefit of the Secured Parties) in respect of all Article 9
         Collateral consisting of Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights in which a
         security interest may be perfected by filing, recording or registration
         in the United States (or any political subdivision thereof) and its
         territories and possessions, and no further or subsequent filing,
         refiling, recording, rerecording, registration or reregistration is
         necessary (other than such actions as are necessary to perfect the
         Security Interest with respect to any Article 9 Collateral consisting
         of Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights (or registration or application
         for registration thereof) acquired or developed after the date hereof).

                  (g) The Security Interest constitutes (i) a legal and valid
         security interest in all the Article 9 Collateral securing the payment
         and performance of the Obligations, (ii) subject to the filings
         described in Sections 4.02(e), a perfected security interest in all
         Article 9 Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by
         filing, recording or registering a financing statement or analogous
         document in the United States (or any political subdivision thereof)
         and its territories and possessions pursuant to the Uniform Commercial
         Code or other applicable law in such jurisdictions and (iii) a security
         interest that shall be perfected in all Article 9 Collateral in which a
         security interest may be perfected upon the receipt and recording of
         this Agreement with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
         the United States Copyright Office, as applicable, within the
         three-month period (commencing as of the date hereof) pursuant to 35
         U.S.C.ss. 261 or 15 U.S.C. ss. 1060 or the one month period (commencing
         as of the date hereof) pursuant to 17 U.S.C.ss. 205. The Security
         Interest is and shall be prior to any other Lien on any of the Article
         9 Collateral, other than Permitted Encumbrances that have priority as a
         matter of law and Liens expressly permitted to be prior to the Security
         Interest pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section 6.02 of the Credit
         Agreement.

                  (h) The Article 9 Collateral is owned by the Grantors free and
         clear of any Lien, except for Liens expressly permitted pursuant to
         Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement. None of the Grantors has filed or
         consented to the filing of (i) any financing statement or analogous
         document under the Uniform Commercial Code or any other applicable laws
         covering any Article 9 Collateral, (ii) any assignment in which any
         Grantor assigns any Article 9 Collateral or any security agreement or
         similar instrument covering any Article 9 Collateral with the United
         States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright
         Office or (iii) any assignment in which any Grantor assigns any Article
         9 Collateral or any security agreement or similar instrument covering
         any Article 9 Collateral with any foreign governmental, municipal or
         other office, which financing statement or analogous document,
         assignment, security agreement or similar instrument is still in
         effect, except, in each case, for (i) financing statements filed in
         favor of the Collateral Agent; (ii) Liens expressly permitted pursuant
         to Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement (including protective filings
         with respect to leases, consignments, bailments and similar
         relationships permitted thereunder), and (iii) financing statements for
         which proper termination statements have been delivered to the
         Collateral Agent for filing.

                  (i) no consent or approval of any Governmental Authority, any
         securities exchange or any other Person, including any other general or
         limited partner, any other member of a limited liability company, any
         other shareholder or any other trust beneficiary was or is necessary in
         connection with the creation, perfection or first priority status of

         Collateral or the exercise by the Collateral Agent of the voting or
         other rights provided for in this Agreement or the exercise of remedies
         in respect thereof (other than such as have been obtained and are in
         full force and effect).

                  (j) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
         each Grantor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
         such Grantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
         applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
         laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
         principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
         in equity or at law.

         SECTION 4.03 Covenants. In addition to the covenants made in Section 3
above with respect to Pledged Collateral, the Grantors jointly and severally
covenant that:

         (a) Each Grantor agrees to maintain, at its own cost and expense, such
complete and accurate records with respect to the Article 9 Collateral owned by
it as is consistent with its current practices and in accordance with such
prudent and standard practices used in industries that are the same as or
similar to those in which such Grantor is engaged, but in any event to include
complete accounting records indicating all payments and proceeds received with
respect to any part of the Article 9 Collateral and delivery of the information
required by Section 5.10(b) of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that
upon a Default, Collateral Agent may request and each Grantor hereby agrees to
prepare and deliver, a duly certified schedule or schedules in form and detail
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent showing the identity, amount and location
of any and all Article 9 Collateral.

         (b) Each Grantor shall, at its own expense, take any and all actions
necessary to defend title to the Article 9 Collateral against all Persons and to
defend the Security Interest of the Collateral Agent in the Article 9 Collateral
and the priority thereof against any Lien not expressly permitted pursuant to
Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement.

         (c) Each Grantor agrees, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge,
deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents
and take all such actions that may be necessary or desirable, or as the
Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably and practicably request, to
better assure, preserve, protect and perfect the Security Interest and the
rights and remedies created hereby, including the payment of any fees and taxes
required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
granting of the Security Interest and the filing of any financing statements
(including fixture filings) or other documents in connection herewith or
therewith. If any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Article
9 Collateral shall be or


                                       17
<PAGE>

become evidenced by any promissory note or other instrument, such note or
instrument shall be immediately pledged and delivered to the Collateral Agent,
duly endorsed in a manner satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (i) Grantor shall only be obligated to deliver
and pledge promissory notes having an individual outstanding principal balance
equal to or greater than $100,000 and (ii) within five (5) days of each six (6)
month anniversary of the Effective Date, Grantor shall deliver to Collateral
Agent (A) such other promissory notes with an individual principal amount
outstanding thereunder equal to or greater than $100,000 and (B) such other
promissory notes not included within the immediately preceding clause (A) to the
extent the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all such promissory notes
in the Loan Parties' possession exceeds $4,000,000 (the "Waterfall Amount"), so
that after delivery of such additional promissory notes Grantor will not be in
possession of promissory notes whose aggregate principal balance exceeds the
Waterfall Amount. Grantor may deliver any combination of such promissory notes
to meet the foregoing requirements.

         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby
agrees to promptly notify the Collateral Agent in writing (by executing and
delivering to the Collateral Agent a completed Pledge Supplement, substantially
in the form of Exhibit III attached hereto) of any changes to the information
contained in the Schedules hereto and in the Perfection Certificate, and to
provide such other information in connection therewith as the Collateral Agent
may reasonably request. Each Grantor agrees that it will take such action as
shall be necessary in order to maintain the continuous validity, perfection and
the same or better priority of the Collateral Agent's security interest in the
Article 9 Collateral intended to be granted and agreed to hereby. Each Grantor
further agrees that all representations and warranties hereunder shall be true
and correct with respect to such Article 9 Collateral on the date it has
notified the Collateral Agent of the specific changes to the information
contained in the Schedules and the Perfection Certificate.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Grantors shall not be
required to perfect the Security Interest in any Collateral to the extent
perfection is required in any jurisdiction other than the United States of
America or any state thereof.

         (d) The Collateral Agent and such Persons as the Collateral Agent may
reasonably designate shall have the right, at the Grantors' own cost and expense
and in accordance with Sections 5.06 and 5.10 of the Credit Agreement, to
inspect the Article 9 Collateral, all records related thereto (and to make
extracts and copies from such records) and the premises upon which any of the
Article 9 Collateral is located, to discuss the Grantors' affairs with the
officers of the Grantors and their independent accountants and to verify under
reasonable procedures, the validity, amount, quality, quantity, value, condition
and status of, or any other matter relating to, the Article 9 Collateral,
including, in the case of Accounts or Article 9 Collateral in the possession of
any third person, by contacting Account Debtors or the third person possessing
such Article 9 Collateral for the purpose of making such a verification. Subject
to Section 9.12 of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall have the
absolute right to share any information it gains from such inspection or
verification with any Secured Party.


                                       18
<PAGE>

         (e) At its option, the Collateral Agent may discharge past due taxes,
assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances at
any time levied or placed on the Article 9 Collateral and not permitted pursuant
to Sections 5.04 or 6.02 of the Credit Agreement, and may pay for the
maintenance and preservation of the Article 9 Collateral to the extent any
Grantor fails to do so as required by the Credit Agreement or this Agreement,
and each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent
on demand for any payment made or any expense incurred by the Collateral Agent
pursuant to the foregoing authorization; provided that nothing in this paragraph
(e) shall be interpreted as excusing any Grantor from the performance of, or
imposing any obligation on the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party to cure or
perform, any covenants or other promises of any Grantor with respect to taxes,
assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and
maintenance as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.

         (f) If at any time any Grantor shall take a security interest in any
property of an Account Debtor or any other Person to secure payment and
performance of an Account, such Grantor shall promptly assign such security
interest to the Collateral Agent. Such Grantor authorizes the filing of any
financing statements the Collateral Agent deems necessary to continue the
perfected status of the security interest against creditors of and transferees
from the Account Debtor or other Person granting the security interest.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Grantor shall only be obligated
to deliver instruments regarding Accounts to the extent the aggregate fair
market value thereof exceeds $25,000.

         (g) Each Grantor shall remain liable to observe and perform all the
conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it under each
contract, agreement or instrument relating to the Article 9 Collateral, all in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, and each Grantor jointly and
severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Collateral Agent and the
Secured Parties from and against any and all liability for such performance.

         (h) None of the Grantors shall make or permit to be made an assignment,
pledge or hypothecation of the Article 9 Collateral or shall grant any other
Lien in respect of the Article 9 Collateral, except as expressly permitted by
Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement. None of the Grantors shall make or permit
to be made any transfer of the Collateral and each Grantor shall remain at all
times in possession of the Article 9 Collateral owned by it, except that (i)
Inventory may be sold in the ordinary course of business and (ii) unless and
until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing during which the
Grantors shall not sell, convey, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any Article 9 Collateral (which notice may be given by telephone if promptly
confirmed in writing), the Grantors may use and dispose of the Article 9
Collateral in any lawful manner not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that it shall not permit any
Inventory to be in the possession or control of any warehouseman, bailee, agent
or processor at any time unless such warehouseman, bailee, agent or processor
shall have been notified of the Security Interest and shall have acknowledged in
writing, in form and substance satisfactory to the


                                       19
<PAGE>

Collateral Agent, that such bailee or processor holds the Inventory for the
benefit of the Collateral Agent subject to the Security Interest and shall act
upon the instructions of the Collateral Agent without further consent from the
Grantor, and that such warehouseman, agent, bailee or processor further agrees
to waive and release any Lien held by it with respect to such Inventory, whether
arising by operation of law or otherwise.

         (i) None of the Grantors will, without the Collateral Agent's prior
written consent, grant any extension of the time of payment of any Accounts
included in the Article 9 Collateral, compromise, compound or settle the same
for less than the full amount thereof, release, wholly or partly, any Person
liable for the payment thereof or allow any credit or discount whatsoever
thereon, other than extensions, credits, discounts, compromises or settlements
granted or made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with its
current practices or in accordance with such prudent and standard practice used
in industries that are the same as or similar to those in which such Grantor is
engaged.

         (j) The Grantors, at their own expense, shall maintain or cause to be
maintained insurance covering physical loss or damage to the Inventory and
Equipment in accordance with the requirements set forth in Schedule IV hereto
and Section 5.09 of the Credit Agreement. Each Grantor irrevocably makes,
constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent (and all officers, employees or
agents designated by the Collateral Agent) as such Grantor's true and lawful
agent (and attorney-in-fact) for the purpose, during the continuance of an Event
of Default, of making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of Article 9
Collateral under policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such Grantor on
any check, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such
policies of insurance and for making all determinations and decisions with
respect thereto. In the event that any Grantor at any time or times shall fail
to obtain or maintain any of the policies of insurance required hereby or to pay
any premium in whole or part relating thereto, the Collateral Agent may, without
waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of the Grantors hereunder or
any Event of Default, in its sole discretion, obtain and maintain such policies
of insurance and pay such premium and take any other actions with respect
thereto as the Collateral Agent deems advisable. All sums disbursed by the
Collateral Agent in connection with this paragraph (j), including reasonable
attorneys' fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall
be payable, upon demand, by the Grantors to the Collateral Agent and shall be
additional Obligations secured hereby.

         (k) Each Grantor shall maintain, in its customary form and in
accordance with historical practice, or in such other form and manner
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, records of its Chattel Paper and its
books, records and documents evidencing or pertaining thereto.

         (l) Each Grantor consents to the grant by each other Grantor of a
security interest in all Investment Property to the Collateral Agent.

         SECTION 4.04 Other Actions. In order to further insure the attachment,
perfection and priority of, and the ability of the Collateral Agent to enforce,
the Collateral


                                       20
<PAGE>

Agent's Security Interest in the Article 9 Collateral, each Grantor agrees, in
each case at such Grantor's own expense, to take the following actions with
respect to the following Article 9 Collateral:

                  (a) Instruments. If any Grantor shall at any time hold or
         acquire any Instruments, such Grantor shall forthwith deliver the same
         to the Collateral Agent, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or
         assignment duly endorsed in blank by an "effective indorsement" (as
         defined in the UCC) in a manner acceptable to the Collateral Agent.
         Grantor shall only be obligated to deliver Instruments to the extent
         the fair market value thereof exceeds $25,000.

                  (b) Deposit Accounts. For each deposit account that any
         Grantor at any time opens or maintains (other than Convenience
         Accounts), such Grantor shall, at the Collateral Agent's request and
         option, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, either (i) cause the depositary
         bank to agree to comply at any time with instructions from the
         Collateral Agent to such depositary bank directing the disposition of
         funds from time to time credited to such deposit account, without
         further consent of such Grantor, or (ii) arrange for the Collateral
         Agent to become the customer of the depositary bank with respect to the
         deposit account, with the Grantor being permitted, only with the
         consent of the Collateral Agent, to exercise rights to withdraw funds
         from such deposit account. The Collateral Agent agrees with each
         Grantor that the Collateral Agent shall not give any such instructions
         or withhold any withdrawal rights from any Grantor, unless an Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing, or, after giving effect to any
         withdrawal, would occur. As used herein, "Convenience Accounts" means
         the individual deposit accounts used for daily deposits for individual
         restaurants, bakeries, cafes and other units that do not have and are
         not expected to ever have, a daily average deposit balance in excess of
         $25,000 over any fiscal year of Grantor.

                  (c) Investment Property. If any Grantor shall at any time hold
         or acquire any certificated securities, such Grantor shall forthwith
         deliver the same to the Collateral Agent, accompanied by such
         instruments of transfer or assignment duly endorsed in blank by an
         "effective indorsement" (as defined in the UCC) in a manner acceptable
         to the Collateral Agent. If any securities now or hereafter acquired by
         any Grantor are uncertificated and are issued to such Grantor or its
         nominee directly by the issuer thereof, such Grantor shall immediately
         notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at the Collateral Agent's
         request and option, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
         satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, either (i) cause the issuer to
         agree to comply with instructions from the Collateral Agent as to such
         securities, without further consent of any Grantor or such nominee, or
         (ii) arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the registered owner of
         the securities. If any securities, whether certificated or
         uncertificated, or other investment property now or hereafter acquired
         by any Grantor are held by such Grantor or its nominee through a
         securities intermediary or commodity intermediary, such Grantor shall
         immediately notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at the Collateral
         Agent's request and option, pursuant to an agreement in


                                       21
<PAGE>

         form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent,
         either (A) cause such securities intermediary or (as the case may be)
         commodity intermediary to agree to comply with entitlement orders or
         other instructions from the Collateral Agent to such securities
         intermediary as to such securities or other investment property, or (as
         the case may be) to apply any value distributed on account of any
         commodity contract as directed by the Collateral Agent to such
         commodity intermediary, in each case without further consent of any
         Grantor or such nominee, or (B) in the case of Financial Assets or
         other Investment Property held through a securities intermediary,
         arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the entitlement holder with
         respect to such investment property, with the Grantor being permitted,
         only with the consent of the Collateral Agent, to exercise rights to
         withdraw or otherwise deal with such investment property. The
         Collateral Agent agrees with each of the Grantors that the Collateral
         Agent shall not give any such entitlement orders or instructions or
         directions to any such issuer, securities intermediary or commodity
         intermediary, and shall not withhold its consent to the exercise of any
         withdrawal or dealing rights by any Grantor, unless an Event of Default
         has occurred and is continuing, or, after giving effect to any such
         investment and withdrawal rights, would occur.

                  (d) Electronic Chattel Paper and Transferable Records. If any
         Grantor at any time holds or acquires an interest in any electronic
         chattel paper or any "transferable record," as that term is defined in
         Section 201 of the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National
         Commerce Act, or in Section 16 of the Uniform Electronic Transactions
         Act as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction, the face amount of which
         shall exceed $25,000, such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral
         Agent thereof and, at the request of the Collateral Agent, shall take
         such action as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request to vest in
         the Collateral Agent control under UCC Section 9-105 of such electronic
         chattel paper or control under Section 201 of the Federal Electronic
         Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or, as the case may be,
         Section 16 of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, as so in effect
         in such jurisdiction, of such transferable record. The Collateral Agent
         agrees with such Grantor that the Collateral Agent will arrange,
         pursuant to procedures satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and so long
         as such procedures will not result in the Collateral Agent's loss of
         control, for the Grantor to make alterations to the electronic chattel
         paper or transferable record permitted under UCC Section 9-105 or, as
         the case may be, Section 201 of the Federal Electronic Signatures in
         Global and National Commerce Act or Section 16 of the Uniform
         Electronic Transactions Act for a party in control to allow without
         loss of control, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing or would occur after taking into account any action by such
         Grantor with respect to such electronic chattel paper or transferable
         record.

                  (e) Letter-of-Credit Rights. If any Grantor is at any time a
         beneficiary under a letter of credit now or hereafter issued in favor
         of such Grantor which has a maximum draw amount in excess of $100,000,
         such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at
         the request and option of the Collateral Agent, such Grantor shall,
         pursuant to an agreement in form and substance


                                       22
<PAGE>

         reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, either (i) arrange for
         the issuer and any confirmer of such letter of credit to consent to an
         assignment to the Collateral Agent of the proceeds of any drawing under
         the letter of credit or (ii) arrange for the Collateral Agent to become
         the transferee beneficiary of the letter of credit, with the Collateral
         Agent agreeing, in each case, that the proceeds of any drawing under
         the letter of credit are to be paid to the applicable Pledgor unless an
         Event of Default has occurred or is continuing.

                  (f) Commercial Tort Claims. If any Grantor shall at any time
         hold or acquire a commercial tort claim in a total claim amount in
         excess of $100,000, the Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral
         Agent thereof in writing by executing and delivering to the Collateral
         Agent a completed Pledge Supplement, substantially in the form of
         Exhibit III attached hereto, identifying such Commercial Tort Claims,
         including a summary description of such claim.

         SECTION 4.05 Covenants regarding Patent, Trademark and Copyright
Collateral. (a) Each Grantor agrees that it will not, and will not permit any of
its licensees to, do any act, or omit do to any act, whereby any Patent that is
material to the conduct of the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
(considered as a whole) may become invalidated or dedicated to the public, and
agrees that it shall continue to mark any products covered by a Patent with the
relevant patent number as necessary and sufficient to establish and preserve its
maximum rights under applicable patent laws.

         (b) Each Grantor (either itself or through its licensees or its
sublicensees) will, for each Trademark material to the conduct of the business
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (considered as a whole), (1) maintain the
quality of products and services offered under such Trademark, (2) display such
Trademark with notice of Federal or foreign registration to the extent necessary
and sufficient to establish and preserve its maximum rights under applicable law
and (3) not knowingly use or knowingly permit the use of such Trademark in
violation of any third party rights.

         (c) Each Grantor (either itself or through its licensees or
sublicensees) will, for each work covered by Copyright material to the conduct
of the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (considered as a whole),
continue to publish, reproduce, display, adopt and distribute the work with
appropriate copyright notice as necessary and sufficient to establish and
preserve its maximum rights under applicable copyright laws.

         (d) Each Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent if it knows
that any Patent, Trademark or Copyright material to the conduct of the business
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (considered as a whole) may become
abandoned, lost or dedicated to the public, or of any adverse determination or
development (including the institution of, or any such determination or
development in, any proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
United States Copyright Office or any court or similar office of any country)
regarding such Grantor's ownership of any Patent, Trademark or Copyright, its
right to register the same, or its right to keep and maintain the same.


                                       23
<PAGE>

         (e) In no event shall any Grantor, either itself or through any agent,
employee, licensee or designee, file an application for any Patent, Trademark or
Copyright (or for the registration of any Trademark or Copyright) with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office, United States Copyright Office or any
office or agency in any political subdivision of the United States or in any
other country or any political subdivision thereof, unless it promptly informs
the Collateral Agent thereof (but in no event more than 90 days after any
Grantor obtains knowledge thereof), and, upon request of the Collateral Agent,
executes and delivers any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers
as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request to evidence the Collateral
Agent's security interest in such Patent, Trademark or Copyright, and each
Grantor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent as its attorney-in-fact to execute
and file such writings for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such attorney
being hereby ratified and confirmed; such power, being coupled with an interest,
is irrevocable.

         (f) Each Grantor will take all necessary steps that are consistent with
the practice in any proceeding before the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, United States Copyright Office or any office or agency in any political
subdivision of the United States or in any other country or any political
subdivision thereof, to maintain and pursue each material application relating
to the Patents, Trademarks and/or Copyrights (and to obtain the relevant grant
or registration) and to maintain each issued Patent and each registration of the
Trademarks and Copyrights that is material to the conduct of the business of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries (considered as a whole), including timely filings
of applications for renewal, affidavits of use, affidavits of incontestability
and payment of maintenance fees, and, if consistent with good business judgment,
to initiate opposition, interference and cancellation proceedings against third
parties.

         (g) In the event that any Grantor has reason to believe that any
Article 9 Collateral consisting of a Patent, Trademark or Copyright material to
the conduct of the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (considered as
a whole) has been or is about to be infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a
third party, such Grantor promptly shall notify the Collateral Agent as such
notice is required by Section 4.04(f) herein, and shall promptly take all
reasonable actions to stop such infringement, misappropriation or dilution and
take such other actions as are appropriate under the circumstances to protect
such Article 9 Collateral including, but not limited to, the initiation of a
suit to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or
dilution.

         (h) Upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each
Grantor shall use its best efforts to obtain all requisite consents or approvals
by the licensor of each Copyright License, Patent License or Trademark License
to effect the assignment of all such Grantor's right, title and interest
thereunder to the Collateral Agent or its designee.

                                   ARTICLE V

                                    Remedies


                                       24
<PAGE>

         SECTION 5.01 Remedies upon Default. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor agrees to deliver each item of
Collateral to the Collateral Agent on demand, and it is agreed that the
Collateral Agent shall have the right to take any of or all the following
actions at the same or different times: (a) with respect to any Article 9
Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property, on demand, to cause the Security
Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such
Article 9 Collateral by the applicable Grantors to the Collateral Agent, or to
license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an
exclusive or nonexclusive basis, any such Article 9 Collateral throughout the
world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Collateral Agent
shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing
arrangements to the extent that waivers cannot be obtained), and (b) with or
without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for
performance, to take possession of the Article 9 Collateral and without
liability for trespass to enter any premises where the Article 9 Collateral may
be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Article 9
Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured
party under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the
Collateral Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of
applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the
Collateral at a public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any
securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the
Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate. The Collateral Agent shall be
authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the
prospective bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and agree that
they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not
with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any
such sale the Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and
deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such
purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from
any claim or right on the part of any Grantor or Pledgor, and the Grantors and
Pledgors hereby waive (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption,
stay and appraisal which such Grantor or Pledgor now has or may at any time in
the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter
enacted.

         The Collateral Agent shall give the applicable Grantors and Pledgors 10
days' written notice (which each Grantor or Pledgor agrees is reasonable notice
within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the UCC or its equivalent in other
jurisdictions) of the Collateral Agent's intention to make any sale of Article 9
Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and
place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a
securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to
be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be
offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held
at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places
as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale.
At any such sale the Collateral or portion thereof to be sold may be sold in one
lot as an entirety or in separate parcels as the Collateral Agent may (in its
sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be
obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so,
regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been
given.


                                       25
<PAGE>

The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or
private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement
at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice,
be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any
sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future
delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until
the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the
Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or
purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case
of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any
public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this
Section, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent
permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on
the part of any Grantor or Pledgor (all said rights being also hereby waived and
released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof
offered for sale and may (with the consent of the Collateral Agent) make payment
on account thereof by using any Obligation then due and payable to such Secured
Party from any Grantor or Pledgor as a credit against the purchase price, and
such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and
dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor or
Pledgor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the
Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the
Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement
and no Grantor or Pledgor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or
any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the
Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default
shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. As an alternative to
exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may
proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and
to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree
of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding
by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 5.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards
as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the UCC or its equivalent in other
jurisdictions.

         SECTION 5.02 Application of Proceeds. The Collateral Agent shall apply
the proceeds of any collection or sale of Collateral as well as any Collateral
consisting of cash as follows:

                  FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by
         the Collateral Agent in connection with such collection or sale or
         otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or
         any of the Obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable
         fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel incurred, the
         repayment of all advances made by the Collateral Agent hereunder or
         under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Grantor or Pledgor and
         any other reasonable costs or expenses incurred in connection with the
         exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan
         Document;

                  SECOND, to the payment in full of the Obligations (the amounts
         so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties pro rata in
         accordance with


                                       26
<PAGE>

         the amounts of the Obligations owed to them on the date of any such
         distribution); and

                  THIRD, to the Grantors and Pledgors, their successors or
         assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.

The Collateral Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of
application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this
Agreement and the Credit Agreement. Upon any sale of Collateral by the
Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or
under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Collateral Agent or of the
officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or
purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not
be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid
over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the
misapplication thereof.

         SECTION 5.03 Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property. For the
purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to exercise rights and remedies under
this Article at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to
exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral
Agent an irrevocable, nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of
royalty or other compensation to the Grantors) to use, license or sublicense any
of the Article 9 Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property now owned or
hereafter acquired by such Grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and
including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the
licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and
programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. The use of such license
by the Collateral Agent shall be exercised, at the option of the Collateral
Agent, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default;
provided that any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the
Collateral Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the Grantors
notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.

         SECTION 5.04 Securities Act, etc. In view of the position of the
Pledgors in relation to the Pledged Collateral, or because of other current or
future circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as
now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous
in purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time
in effect being called the "Federal Securities Laws") with respect to any
disposition of the Pledged Collateral permitted hereunder. Each Pledgor
understands that compliance with the Federal Securities Laws might very strictly
limit the course of conduct of the Collateral Agent if the Collateral Agent were
to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, and might
also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee
of any Pledged Collateral could dispose of the same. Similarly, there may be
other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Collateral Agent in any
attempt to dispose of all or part of the Pledged Collateral under applicable
Blue Sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or
effect. Each Pledgor recognizes that in light of such restrictions and
limitations the Collateral Agent may, with respect to any sale of the


                                       27
<PAGE>

Pledged Collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other
things, to acquire such Pledged Collateral for their own account, for
investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each
Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and
limitations, the Collateral Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion (a) may
proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the
purpose of registering such Pledged Collateral or part thereof shall have been
filed under the Federal Securities Laws and (b) may approach and negotiate with
a single potential purchaser to effect such sale. Each Pledgor acknowledges and
agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable
to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In
the event of any such sale, the Collateral Agent shall incur no responsibility
or liability for selling all or any part of the Pledged Collateral at a price
that the Collateral Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good
faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility
that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were
deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single
purchaser were approached. The provisions of this Section 5.04 will apply
notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the
quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the
Collateral Agent sells.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                    Indemnity, Subrogation and Subordination

         SECTION 6.01 Indemnity and Subrogation. In addition to all such rights
of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law
(but subject to Section 6.03), the Borrower agrees that (a) in the event a
payment shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement in respect of any
Obligation of the Borrower, then the Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor for
the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the
rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of
such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any Guarantor shall be sold
pursuant to any Security Document to satisfy an Obligation of the Borrower, then
the Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor in an amount equal to the greater of
the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.

         SECTION 6.02 Contribution and Subrogation. Each Guarantor (a
"Contributing Guarantor") agrees (subject to Section 6.03) that, in the event a
payment shall be made by any other Guarantor hereunder in respect of any
Obligation or assets of any other Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to any
Security Document to satisfy any Obligation owed to any Secured Party and such
other Guarantor (the "Claiming Guarantor") shall not have been fully indemnified
by the Borrower as provided in Section 6.01, the Contributing Guarantor shall
indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such
payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such
assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the
numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date
hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the
Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party
hereto pursuant to


                                       28
<PAGE>

Section 7.16, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such
Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming
Guarantor pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subrogated to the rights of
such Claiming Guarantor under Section 6.01 to the extent of such payment.

         SECTION 6.03 Subordination. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors under Sections 6.01 and
6.02 and all other rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under
applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible
payment in full in cash of the Obligations. No failure on the part of the
Borrower or any Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 6.01 and
6.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in
any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect
to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the
full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.

         (b) The Borrower and Subsidiary Parties hereby agree that all
Indebtedness and other monetary obligations owed by it to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in
cash of the Obligations provided that, for so long as no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, all such Indebtedness may be paid in accordance with
the terms of the instruments evidencing such Indebtedness.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                  Miscellaneous

         SECTION 7.01 Notices. All communications and notices hereunder shall
(except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as
provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement. All communications and notices
hereunder to any Subsidiary Party shall be given to it in care of the Borrower
as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 7.02 Security Interest Absolute. All rights of the Collateral
Agent hereunder, the Security Interest, the grant of a security interest in the
Pledged Collateral and all obligations of each Grantor and Pledgor hereunder
shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or
enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any agreement
with respect to any of the Obligations or any other agreement or instrument
relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of
payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other
amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument, (c) any
exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on other collateral, or any
release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any
guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Obligations, or (d) any
other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a
discharge of, any Grantor or Pledgor in respect of the Obligations or this
Agreement.


                                       29

         SECTION 7.03 Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents
and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to
have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and
issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any
such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Collateral Agent,
the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default
or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under
the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under the Credit Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of
Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or
terminated. SECTION 7.04 ....Binding Effect; Several Agreement. This Agreement
shall become effective as to any Loan Party when a counterpart hereof executed
on behalf of such Loan Party shall have been delivered to the Collateral Agent
and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Collateral
Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Loan Party and the Collateral
Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the
benefit of such Loan Party, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties
and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party shall
have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any
interest herein or in the Collateral (and any such assignment or transfer shall
be void) except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the Credit
Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with
respect to each Loan Party and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or
released with respect to any Loan Party without the approval of any other Loan
Party and without affecting the obligations of any other Loan Party hereunder.

         SECTION 7.05 Successors and Assigns. Subject to Section 9.04 of the
Credit Agreement, whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is
referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and
assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on
behalf of any Loan Party or the Collateral Agent that are contained in this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and
assigns.

         SECTION 7.06 Collateral Agent's Expenses; Indemnification(a) . The
provisions of Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement shall apply hereto as if
fully set forth herein.

         SECTION 7.07 Collateral Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Each Grantor
and each Pledgor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent the attorney-in-fact of
such Grantor or Pledgor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this
Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Collateral
Agent may reasonably deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes
hereof upon the occurrence and continuation of a Default (except as otherwise
provided in Section 4.01(b) herein), which appointment is irrevocable and
coupled with an interest. Without


                                       30
<PAGE>

limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall have the
right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
with full power of substitution either in the Collateral Agent's name or in the
name of such Grantor or Pledgor (a) in the case of a Grantor (i) to receive,
endorse, assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts,
money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Article 9 Collateral
or any part thereof; (ii) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt
for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the Article 9 Collateral;
(iii) to sign the name of any Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating
to any of the Article 9 Collateral; (iv) to send verifications of Accounts
Receivable to any Account Debtor; (v) to commence and prosecute any and all
suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent
jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Article 9
Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Article 9 Collateral; (vi)
to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or
proceedings relating to all or any of the Article 9 Collateral; (vii) to notify,
or to require any Grantor to notify, Account Debtors to make payment directly to
the Collateral Agent; and (viii) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make
any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Article 9
Collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Collateral
Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes; and (b) in the
case of a Pledgor (i) to ask for, demand, sue for, collect, receive and give
acquittance for any and all moneys due or to become due under and by virtue of
any Pledged Collateral; (ii) to endorse checks, drafts, orders and other
instruments for the payment of money payable to the Pledgor representing any
interest or dividend or other distribution payable in respect of the Pledged
Collateral or any part thereof or on account thereof and to give full discharge
of the same; (iii) to settle, compromise, prosecute or defend any action, claim
or proceeding with respect thereto; and (iv) to sell, assign, endorse, pledge,
transfer and to make any agreement respecting, or otherwise deal with, the same;
provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or
obligating the Collateral Agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as
to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Collateral Agent, or
to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to
the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in
respect thereof or any property covered thereby. The Collateral Agent and the
other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as
a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they
nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any
Grantor or Pledgor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         SECTION 7.08 APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

         SECTION 7.09 Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay by the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further


                                       31
<PAGE>

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and
remedies of the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of
any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall
in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of
this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether
the Collateral Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or
knowledge of such Default at the time.

         (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Collateral Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties with
respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to
any consent required in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 7.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         SECTION 7.11 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

         SECTION 7.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each
of which shall constitute a single contract (subject to Section 7.04), and shall
become effective as provided in Section 7.04. Delivery of an executed signature
page to this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.13 Headings. Article and Section headings used herein are for
the purpose of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and are not to
affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting,
this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.14 Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) Each of
the Loan Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State
of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court
of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or,
to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall affect any right that the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or
any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document against the Borrower or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

         (b) Each of the Loan Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

         (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 7.01. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

         SECTION 7.15 Termination or Release. (a) This Agreement, the
Guarantees, the Security Interest and all other security interests granted
hereby shall terminate when all the Obligations (other than contingent or
inchoate indemnification and reimbursement obligations) have been indefeasibly
paid in full and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend under the Credit
Agreement, the LC Exposure has been reduced to zero and the Issuing Bank has no
further obligations to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement.

         (b) A Subsidiary Party shall automatically be released from its
obligations hereunder and the Security Interest in the Collateral of such
Subsidiary Party shall be automatically released upon the consummation of any
transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement as a result of which such
Subsidiary Party ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower; provided that the
Required Lenders shall have consented to such transaction


                                       33
<PAGE>

(to the extent required by the Credit Agreement) and the terms of such consent
did not provide otherwise.

         (c) Upon any sale or other transfer by any Grantor or Pledgor of any
Collateral that is permitted under the Credit Agreement to any Person that is
not the Borrower or a Subsidiary Party, or, upon the effectiveness of any
written consent to the release of the security interest granted hereby in any
Collateral pursuant to Sections 8.01 and 9.02 of the Credit Agreement, the
security interest in such Collateral shall be automatically released.

         (d) In connection with any termination or release pursuant to
subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c), the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to
any Grantor or Pledgor, as the case may be, at such Grantor's or Pledgor's
expense, all documents that such Grantor or Pledgor shall reasonably request to
evidence such termination or release. Any execution and delivery of documents
pursuant to this Section 7.15 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the
Collateral Agent.

         SECTION 7.16 Additional Subsidiaries. Pursuant to Section 5.11 of the
Credit Agreement, each wholly owned Subsidiary Loan Party that was not in
existence on the date of the Credit Agreement and certain entities that are not
wholly owned Subsidiaries that were not in existence on the date of this
Agreement, are required to enter in this Agreement as a Subsidiary Party. Upon
execution and delivery by the Collateral Agent and a Subsidiary of an instrument
in the form of Exhibit I hereto, such Subsidiary shall become a Subsidiary Party
hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Subsidiary
Party herein. The execution and delivery of any such instrument shall not
require the consent of any Loan Party hereunder. The rights and obligations of
each Loan Party hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding
the addition of any new Subsidiary Party as a party to this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.17 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any
Subsidiary Party against any of and all the obligations of such Subsidiary Party
now or hereafter existing under this agreement held by such Lender, irrespective
of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement
and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under
this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

         SECTION 7.18 Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent has been appointed
to act as Collateral Agent hereunder by Lenders and, by their acceptance of the
benefits hereof, the other Secured Parties. The Collateral Agent shall be
obligated, and shall have the right hereunder, to make demands, to give notices,
to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from
taking any action (including, without limitation, the release or substitution of
Collateral), solely in accordance with this

privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent, and the retiring
Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent under the terms
of the Credit Agreement by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor
Administrative Agent shall thereby also be deemed the successor Collateral Agent
and such successor Collateral Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral
Agent under this Agreement. The retiring Collateral Agent under this Agreement
shall promptly (i) transfer to such successor Collateral Agent all sums and
other items of Collateral held hereunder, together with all records and other
documents necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of the
duties of the successor Collateral Agent under this Agreement, and (ii) execute
and deliver to such successor Collateral Agent such amendments to financing
statements, and take such other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate in
connection with the assignment to such successor Collateral Agent of the
security interests created hereunder, whereupon such retiring Collateral Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After
any retiring Collateral Agent's resignation hereunder as the Collateral Agent,
the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement while it was the
Collateral Agent hereunder.

Grantor, Pledgor and Guarantor under the Collateral Agreement with the same
force and effect as if originally named therein as a Grantor, Pledgor and

hereby (a) agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Collateral Agreement
applicable to it as a Grantor, Pledgor and Guarantor thereunder and (b)
represents and warrants that the representations and warranties made by it as a
Grantor, Pledgor and Guarantor thereunder are true and correct on and as of the
date hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, the New Subsidiary, as collateral
security for the prompt and complete payment or performance, as the case may be,

stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or
otherwise, does hereby grant to the Collateral Agent, its successors and
assigns, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, their successors and
assigns, a security interest and continuing lien in all of the New Subsidiary's
right, title and interest in and to the Collateral (as defined in the Collateral
Agreement) of the New Subsidiary, whether now owned or existing or at any time
hereafter arising or acquired by such New Subsidiary or in which such New
Subsidiary now has or at any time in the future may acquire any right, title or
interest and wherever the same may be located. Each reference to a "Pledgor" in
the Collateral Agreement shall be deemed to include the New Subsidiary. The
Collateral Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

         SECTION 2. The New Subsidiary represents and warrants to the Collateral
Agent and the other Secured Parties that this Supplement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

         SECTION 3. This Supplement may be executed in counterparts (and by
different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a
single contract. This Supplement shall become effective when the Collateral
Agent shall have received counterparts of this Supplement that, when taken
together, bear the signatures of the New Subsidiary and the Collateral Agent.
Delivery of an executed signature page to this Supplement by facsimile
transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart
of this Supplement.

         SECTION 4. The New Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants that it
has attached hereto, in a form satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, (a) a
completed and accurate Perfection Certificate (as such term is defined in the

Section set forth all additional information required pursuant to the Collateral
Agreement and agrees that such attachments shall hereby constitute part of the
Collateral Agreement.

         SECTION 7. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Supplement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein and in the Collateral Agreement shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the
validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties hereto shall
endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

         SECTION 8. All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing
and given as provided in Section 7.01 of the Collateral Agreement. All
communications and notices hereunder to the New Grantor shall be given to it at
the address set forth under its signature below.

         SECTION 9. The New Subsidiary agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the New Subsidiary and the Collateral Agent have
duly executed this Supplement to the Collateral Agreement as of the day and year
first above written.

                                    End Notes



--------

1. It is crucial that the full and exact name of each Grantor is given. Even
seemingly minor errors such as substituting "n.a." for "national association" or
"inc." for "incorporated" may be seriously misleading in many states.

2. Please note that the organizational identification number is not the same as
the federal employer's tax identification number. The organizational
identification number is customarily issued by the Secretary of State or State
Corporations Department in the State under which the particular entity had been
organized or formed and may be found on its organizational documents.

3. If a Grantor does not have an organizational identification number, please
indicate "none." Additionally, organizational identification numbers are not
required for corporations organized under the laws of New York or Delaware.

                      [FORM OF AGREEMENT OF SUBORDINATION,
                         NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT]
                           AGREEMENT OF SUBORDINATION,
                         NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT

                  THIS AGREEMENT OF SUBORDINATION, NON-DISTURBANCE AND
ATTORNMENT (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of the ___ day of
____, 200_, between JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, as Administrative Agent, a New York
banking organization and having an office at 707 Travis Street, 4-CBBN-59,
Houston, Texas, 77002 ("MORTGAGEE") and [**TENANT**], a [ ] having an office at
[ ] ("TENANT").

                                    RECITALS

                  A.       Mortgagee is the present mortgagee and AFC
Enterprises Inc. ("LANDLORD"), a Minnesota corporation, is the present mortgagor
under those certain Deeds of Trust (the "MORTGAGES"), which Mortgages encumber
certain real properties (each a "PROPERTY" and together, the "PROPERTIES") as
more fully described in Exhibit A attached hereto. As used herein, the term
"Mortgages" shall include all amendments and modifications thereof and
"Mortgagee" shall include assignees and successors of Mortgagee.

                  B.       Tenant is the lessee of a portion of each of the
Properties by virtue of those leases (the "LEASES") listed on Exhibit B hereto.

                  C.       Mortgagee and Tenant mutually desire the
subordination of the Leases to the Mortgages and the recognition of the Leases
by Mortgagee upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

                  NOW THEREFORE, with reference to the foregoing Recitals and
for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                  1.       Each Lease and all of the terms, covenants and
         provisions thereof and all rights, remedies and options of Tenant
         thereunder are and shall at all times continue to be subject and
         subordinate in all respects to the Mortgage encumbering the Property
         subject to such Lease and to all the terms, conditions and provisions
         thereof, and to the lien thereof, and to all advances made or to be
         made thereunder, and to all amounts secured thereby, and to any
         extensions, modifications, amendments or supplements thereto and to any
         renewals, consolidations or replacements thereof, all with the same
         force and effect as if said Mortgage (including all extensions,
         modifications, amendments and supplements thereto and all renewals,
         consolidations and replacements thereof) had been executed, delivered
         and recorded prior to the execution and delivery of said Lease. Tenant,
         upon request, shall execute and deliver any certificate or other


                                      E-1
<PAGE>

         instrument which Mortgagee may reasonably request to confirm said
         subordination.

                  2.       In the event of the foreclosure of any Mortgage or
         the acquisition of a deed to any Property in lieu of foreclosure prior
         to the expiration or termination of the Lease for such Property, and
         provided that the Lease for such Property is in full force and effect
         and Tenant shall not be in default beyond any applicable grace period
         in the observance or performance of any of the covenants on the part of
         Tenant to be observed or performed under such Lease, Mortgagee does
         hereby agree as follows:

                           (a)      Except as may be specifically otherwise
                  provided in the Lease, Tenant's possession and use of the
                  demised premises in accordance with the provisions of the
                  Lease and all other rights of Tenant under the Lease shall not
                  be affected or disturbed in any way by reason of the
                  subordination to or any modification of or default under the
                  Mortgage; and

                           (b)      Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
                  Mortgagee shall assume and perform the obligations to be
                  performed by the landlord under the Lease during such period
                  as Mortgagee is the owner of the Property, it being intended
                  that Mortgagee shall have no further obligations to Tenant
                  under the Lease or otherwise from and after such time as
                  Mortgagee ceases to be the owner of the Property, except those
                  obligations which arise or accrue during the period in which
                  Mortgagee is the owner of the Property.

         Notwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary, Mortgagee shall
         not be obligated to assume Landlord's obligation under any franchise
         agreement with Tenant.

                  3.       In the event of the foreclosure of any Mortgage or
         the acquisition of a deed to any Property in lieu of foreclosure prior
         to the expiration or termination of the Lease for such Property and
         subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including,
         without limitation, paragraph 2 above), the Lease shall not be
         terminated or affected thereby but shall continue in full force and
         effect as a direct lease between Mortgagee and Tenant upon all of the
         terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Lease (except as
         otherwise expressly provided herein). Tenant hereby covenants and
         agrees to make full and complete attornment to Mortgagee for the
         balance of the term of the Lease upon the same terms, covenants and
         conditions as therein provided so as to establish direct privity of
         estate and contract between Mortgagee and Tenant with the same force
         and effect as if the Lease were originally made directly between
         Mortgagee and Tenant, and Tenant shall promptly execute and deliver any
         instrument that Mortgagee may reasonably request to evidence such
         attornment, but such attornment shall be effective upon such transfer
         without any other or further document or instrument evidencing or
         confirming such attornment.


                                      E-2

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mortgagee shall not be: (i) liable to
         Tenant for any act or omission or negligence of Landlord or any other
         party which has preceded Mortgagee as landlord under the Lease or any
         matter occurring prior to the time Mortgagee has succeeded to the
         interest of the landlord under the Lease; (ii) subject to any
         counterclaim, defense, credit or offset, which theretofore shall have
         accrued to Tenant against Landlord, except to the extent that funds
         relating to such counterclaim, defense, credit or offset has been
         received by Mortgagee; (iii) obligated to perform any work, or liable
         for the commencement or completion of any construction or any
         contribution toward construction or installation of any improvements
         upon the Property, or any portion thereof, required under the Lease to
         be done prior to the date on which Mortgagee takes title to the
         Property or any expansion or renovation of existing improvements
         thereon to the extent that the obligation to make such expansion or
         renovation arose prior to the time Mortgagee takes title to the
         Property; (iv) bound by any previous material modification or amendment
         of the Lease (relating to the lease term, rental, or renewal of the
         lease) unless such modification or amendment shall have been approved
         in writing by Mortgagee; (v) bound by any prepayment of rent made more
         than one month in advance of the due date thereof or for any deposit,
         rental security or any other sums deposited under the Lease (other than
         escalation charges) with any prior landlord under the Lease unless such
         sums are actually received by Mortgagee; (vi) obligated to repair the
         Property or any part thereof or any building or structure thereon in
         the event of total or substantially total damage or partial
         condemnation, beyond such repair as can reasonably be accomplished from
         the net proceeds of insurance or award, as applicable, actually made
         available to Mortgagee; or (vii) liable for or be required to account
         for any security deposit other than any security deposit not actually
         delivered to Mortgagee.

                  4.       Nothing contained in this Agreement or any Lease
         shall affect the prior rights of Mortgagee with respect to the proceeds
         of any award in condemnation or of any insurance policies affecting a
         Property (except as otherwise provided in the applicable Lease with
         respect to matters first occurring after Mortgagee succeeds to the
         interest of the landlord thereunder), or impose upon Mortgagee any
         liability in the event of damage or destruction to such Property for
         any repairs, replacements, rebuilding or restoration except as can
         reasonably be accomplished from the net proceeds of insurance actually
         received by, or made available to Mortgagee (except as otherwise
         provided in the Lease with respect to matters first occurring after
         Mortgagee succeeds to the interest of the landlord thereunder).

                  5.       Tenant acknowledges that it has notice that
         Landlord's interest under the Leases and the rent and all other sums
         due thereunder have been assigned to Mortgagee as part of the security
         for the notes secured by the Mortgages. In the event that Mortgagee
         notifies Tenant of a default under any of the Mortgages and demands
         that Tenant pay its rent and all other sums due under one or more
         Leases to Mortgagee, Tenant agrees that it shall pay its rent and all
         other sums due under such Lease or Leases to Mortgagee. By its
         execution of this


                                      E-3
<PAGE>

         Agreement on the signature page hereof, Landlord consents to this
         Agreement and irrevocably directs Tenant to comply with the provisions
         of this paragraph 5, notwithstanding any contrary direction,
         instruction or assertion by Landlord. Such compliance shall not be
         deemed to violate any of the Leases, and Landlord hereby releases
         Tenant from any and all claims arising out of Tenant's compliance with
         this paragraph 5. Tenant shall be entitled to full credit under the
         applicable Lease for any rent paid to Mortgagee pursuant to this
         paragraph 5 to the same extent as if such rent were paid directly to
         Landlord.

                  6.       Any notice, demand or request required hereunder

<PAGE>
in full in cash of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company. The provisions of
this Article [ ] shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Senior Indebtedness is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by a holder of Senior Indebtedness upon
any Proceeding (as defined below) or otherwise, all as though such payment had
not been made.

SECTION [ ].02. Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc. In the event of

before the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the Notes or the Holders of the
Notes are entitled to receive any payment or distribution of any kind or
character, whether in cash, property or securities, on account of Subordinated
Indebtedness, including, without limitation, principal of (or premium, if any)
or interest on or other obligations in respect of the Notes (including any

Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment
thereof, any Notes Payment which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the
Subordinated Indebtedness in any such Proceeding.

                  In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section [ ].02, the Holder of any Note or the Trustee on behalf of the
Holders of the Notes shall have received any Notes Payment before all Senior
Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full in cash, then and in such event such
Notes Payment shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in
bankruptcy or other person making payment or distribution of assets of the
Company for the application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining

holders of Senior Indebtedness.

                  For purposes of this Article [ ] only (including for purposes
of the definition of "Notes Payment") the words "any payment or distribution of
any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities" shall not be
deemed to include a payment or distribution of stock or securities of the
Company provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment authorized by
an order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in a reorganization
proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy law or of any




                                       4
<PAGE>

other corporation provided for by such plan of reorganization or readjustment
which stock or securities are subordinated in right of payment to all then
outstanding Senior Indebtedness to substantially the same extent as, or to a
greater extent than, the Notes are so subordinated as provided in this Article [
]. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into,
another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the
conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of its properties and assets
as an entirety to another Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in
Section [ ].01 shall not be deemed a Proceeding for the purposes of this Section
[ ].02 if the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is
merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer such properties
and assets, as the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger,
conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions set forth in Section [ ].01.

                  The Representative under the Credit Agreement (or in the
absence thereof, a designated Representative for the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness specified as such in a notice to the Trustee) shall have the right
to request the Holders to file and, in the event that a Holder fails to do so
within 10 days, is hereby authorized to file, a proper claim or proof of debt in
the form required in any Proceeding for and on behalf of such Holder (including
on behalf of each such Holder with respect to any such rights received by such
Holder from holders of Indebtedness of the Company due to such Indebtedness
being subordinated to the Subordinated Indebtedness), to accept and receive any
payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable at any time upon or
in respect of the Subordinated Indebtedness in an amount not in excess of the
Senior Indebtedness then outstanding and to take such other action as may be
reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing Trustee and each Holder shall
provide to the Representative under the Credit Agreement (or, if applicable, the
Representative for the other Senior Indebtedness) all information and documents
reasonably necessary to present claims or seek enforcement as aforesaid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each other Holder shall retain the right to vote
to accept or reject any plan of partial or complete liquidation, reorganization,
arrangement, composition or extension; provided that such Holder shall not take
any action or vote in any way so as to contest the enforceability of this
Article [ ] or the Senior Indebtedness. The Representative under the Credit
Agreement and each holder of the Senior Indebtedness shall retain the right to
vote its Senior Indebtedness to accept or reject any plan of partial or complete
liquidation, reorganization, arrangement, composition or extension; provided
that such Representative or such holder shall not take any action or vote in any
way so as to contest the enforceability of this Article [ ] or the Subordinated
Indebtedness.

                  SECTION [ ].03. No Payment When Senior Indebtedness in
Default. In the event that any Senior Payment Default (as defined below) shall
have occurred and be continuing, then no Notes Payment shall be made unless and
until such Senior Payment Default shall have been cured or waived or shall have
ceased to exist or all amounts then due and payable in respect of Senior
Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents. "Senior
Payment Default" means any default in the payment of principal of (or premium,
if any), interest or fees on Designated Senior Indebtedness when due, whether at
the due date of any such payment or by declaration of acceleration, prepayment,
call for redemption or otherwise.

                  Upon the occurrence of a Senior Nonmonetary Default (as
defined below) and receipt of written notice by the Trustee of the occurrence of
such Senior Nonmonetary Default from the Representative for the holders of the
Designated Senior Indebtedness which is the subject of such Senior Nonmonetary
Default specified as such in a notice to the Trustee, no Notes Payment may be
made during a period (the "Payment Blockage Period") commencing on the date of
the receipt by the Trustee of such notice and ending the earlier of (i) the date
on which such Senior Nonmonetary Default shall have been cured or waived or
ceased to exist or all Designated Senior Indebtedness which was the subject of
such Senior Nonmonetary Default shall have been paid in full in cash and (ii)
the 179th day after the date of the receipt of such notice. No Senior
Nonmonetary Default that existed or was continuing on the date of the
commencement of a Payment Blockage Period may be made the basis of the
commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period whether or not within a
period of 360 consecutive days, unless such Senior Nonmonetary Default shall
have been cured for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days, provided,
however, any breach of any financial covenant for a period commencing after the
expiration of a Payment Blockage Period that would give rise to a new event of
default, even though such breach is a breach of a provision under which a prior
event of default previously existed, shall constitute a new event of default for
this purpose. In any event, notwithstanding the foregoing, no more than one
Payment Blockage Period may be commenced during any 360-day period and there
shall be a period of at least 180 days during each 360-day period when no
Payment Blockage Period is in effect and provided further, that the
Representative under the Credit Agreement shall be entitled to deliver the
notice contemplated hereunder upon the occurrence of a Senior Nonmonetary
Default under the Credit Agreement notwithstanding the fact that the
Representative for another class of Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have
previously delivered a notice hereunder. "Senior Nonmonetary Default" means the
occurrence or existence and continuance of an event of default with respect to
Designated Senior Indebtedness, other than a Senior Payment Default, that
permits the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee or other
agent on behalf of the holders thereof) then to declare such Designated Senior
Indebtedness due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise
become due and payable.

                  The failure to make any payment on the Notes by reason of the
provisions of this Section [ ].03 will not be construed as preventing the
occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes arising from any
such failure to make payment. Upon termination of any period of Payment Blockage
Period the Company shall resume making any and all required payments in respect
of the Notes, including any missed payments.

                  In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall make any Notes Payment to the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or to any
Holder prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section [ ].03, then and
in such event such Notes Payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to
the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Company in the same form received
and, until so turned over, the same shall be held in trust by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or such Holder as the property of the holders of the
Senior Indebtedness.



                                       6
<PAGE>

                  By reason of such subordination, in the event of insolvency by
the Company, insubordinate creditors of the Company who are not holders of
Senior Indebtedness or of the Notes may recover less, ratably, than holders of
Senior Indebtedness and more, ratably, than Holders of the Notes.

                  The provisions of this Section [ ].03 shall not apply to any
Notes Payment with respect to which Section [ ].02 would be applicable.

                  SECTION [ ].04. Payment Permitted If No Default. Nothing
contained in this Article [ ] or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any of the
Notes shall prevent the Company, at any time except during the tendency of any
Proceeding referred to in Section [ ].02 or under the conditions described in
Section [ ].03 or described in the proviso to the first sentence of Section [
].02, from making Notes Payments. The Trustee shall give a prompt notice of any
acceleration of the Notes to the Representative under the Credit Agreement (or,
in the absence thereof, to a designated Representative of the Senior
Indebtedness).

                  SECTION [ ].05. Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior
Indebtedness. Only after the payment in full in cash of all amounts due or to
become due on or in respect of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and, unless
the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall have the ability to terminate such
commitments, the termination of all commitments in respect thereof, the Holders
of the Notes shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior
Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and
securities applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and
premium, if any) and interest on the Notes shall be paid in full. For purposes
of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness of the Company of any cash, property or securities to which the
Holders of the Notes or the Trustee on their behalf would be entitled except for
the provisions of this Article [ ], and no payments pursuant to the provisions
of this Article [ ] to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders of the
Notes or the Trustee on their behalf, shall, as among the Company, its creditors
other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Notes, be
deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of the
Senior Indebtedness of the Company.

                  SECTION [ ].06. Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights.
The provisions of this Article [ ] are and are intended solely for the purpose
of defining the relative rights of the Holders on the one hand and the holders
of Senior Indebtedness on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article [ ]
or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Notes is intended to or shall (a)
impair, as among the Company, its creditors (other than holders of Senior
Indebtedness) and the Holders of the Notes, the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional (and which, subject to the rights under this
Article [ ] of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, is intended to rank equally
with all other general unsecured obligations of the Company), to pay to the
Holders of the Notes the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the
Notes as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their
terms; or (b) affect the relative rights against the Company of the Holders of
the Notes and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior
Indebtedness; or (c) prevent the Holder of any Note from




                                       7
<PAGE>

exercising (subject to the proviso to the first sentence of Section [ ]) all
remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this
Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article [ ] of the holders
of Senior Indebtedness to receive cash, property and securities otherwise
payable or deliverable to such Holder or the Trustee on behalf of the Holders.

                  SECTION [ ].07. No Waiver of Subordination Provisions. No
right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce
subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or
impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act
or failure to act in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by
the Company or any Holder with the terms, provisions and covenants of this
Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be
otherwise charged with. Without in any way limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness may at any time and from time
to time, without the consent of or the notice to the Holders, without incurring
responsibility to the Holders and without impairing or releasing the
subordination provided in this Article [ ] or the obligations hereunder of the
Holders to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the
following: (a) subject to the limitations on Senior Indebtedness contained in
the definition thereof or in Section [ ] or Section [ ], change the manner,
place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or alter, Senior
Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which
such Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (b) sell, exchange, release or
otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior
Indebtedness; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of
the Senior Indebtedness; and (d) exercise or refrain from exercising or waiving
any rights, powers or remedies against the Company and any other Persons.

                  SECTION [ ].08. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of
Liquidating Agent. Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of
the Company referred to in this Article [ ], the Trustee and the Holders of the
Notes shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of
competent jurisdiction in which such Proceeding is pending, or a certificate of
the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee
for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person making such payment or
distribution, delivered to the Holders of Notes, for the purpose of ascertaining
the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders
of the Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount
thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon
and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article [ ].

                  SECTION [ ].09. Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness on
Subordination Provisions. Each Holder of a Note, by accepting such Note,
acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are
intended to be an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior
Indebtedness, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or
after the issuance of the Note, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue
to hold, such Senior Indebtedness, and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness
shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such





                                       8
<PAGE>

subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing
to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.

                  SECTION [ ].10. Trustee To Effectuate Subordination. Each
Holder by accepting a Note authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to
take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate
the subordination between the Holders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of
the Company as provided in this Article [ ] and appoints the Trustee as
attorney-in- fact for any and all such purposes.

                  SECTION [ ].11. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior
Indebtedness. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and shall not be liable to any
such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders or the
Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article [ ] or
otherwise.

                  SECTION [ ].12. Third Party Beneficiary; No Amendment. The
provisions of this Article [ ] (including the defined terms used herein) are for
the benefit of the holders of any Senior Indebtedness and shall be enforceable
by each of them directly against any Holder and may not be amended without the
consent of the Representative under the Credit Agreement or, in the absence
thereof, the holders holding the majority in principal amount of such Senior
Indebtedness.

                  SECTION [ ].13. Trustee's Compensation Not Prejudiced. Nothing
in this Article [ ] shall apply to amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to other
sections of this Indenture.

                                  INDEBTEDNESS

as the "Obligations"):

                  (a)      Payment of and performance of all of Mortgagor's

Obligations, whether or not a claim is alleged against Mortgagor for such sums
in any such bankruptcy proceeding;

                  (g)      Due, prompt and complete performance of every
obligation, covenant and agreement of Mortgagor contained in any agreement now
or hereafter executed by Mortgagor which specifically recites that the
obligations thereunder are secured by this Mortgage from and after the date on
which all mortgage recording taxes, general intangible taxes or other taxes
payable in respect of such future obligations have been paid; and

                  (h)      All renewals, extensions, amendments, modifications
and changes and supplements of, or substitutions or replacements for, all or any
part of the items described in Paragraphs (a) through (g) above.

                  FUTURE ADVANCES. In addition to all other indebtedness secured
by this Mortgage, this Mortgage shall also secure and constitute a first Lien on
the Mortgaged Property for:

                  1.       all future advances (including all extensions,
renewals and modifications of such future advances) that relate directly or
indirectly to the Credit Agreement (including advances pursuant to Article II
thereof) or to this Mortgage and are made by the Lenders or Mortgagee to
Mortgagor or otherwise for any purpose so related after the date of this
Mortgage; and

                  2.       all sums advanced or paid by Mortgagee upon a default
or Event of Default under the terms of this Mortgage (i) for real estate taxes,
charges and assessments that may be imposed by law upon the Premises, (ii) for
premiums on insurance policies covering the Premises, (iii) for expenses
incurred in upholding the Lien of this Mortgage, including but not limited to
the expenses of any litigation to prosecute or defend the rights and Lien
created by this Mortgage, (iv) to which Mortgagee becomes subrogated, upon
payment, under recognized principles of law or equity, or under express
statutory authority or (v) for any other purpose, in each case, with interest
thereon at the Agreed Rate; and

                  3.       all other sums expended by Mortgagee pursuant to the
terms of this Mortgage just as if such advances were made on the date of this
Mortgage. Any future advances may be made in accordance with the Credit
Agreement or at the option of Mortgagee.

                  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING FUTURE
                  ADVANCES, THAT MAY BE SECURED BY THIS MORTGAGE MAY INCREASE OR
                  DECREASE FROM TIME TO TIME BUT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM
                  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LISTED ON SCHEDULE 2 HERETO AT ANY ONE TIME
                  PLUS INTEREST THEREON AND ANY DISBURSEMENT MADE BY MORTGAGEE
                  FOR THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, LEVIES, OR INSURANCE AND INTEREST ON
                  ANY SUCH DISBURSEMENT.

                                   ARTICLE 2

                                    REMEDIES

                  2.1      Exercise of Specific Remedies. If an Event of Default
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall occur, Mortgagee may exercise any one
or more of the following remedies, without notice (unless notice is required by
applicable statute):

                  (a)      Acceleration. Mortgagee may declare the Indebtedness
immediately due and payable, without notice, whereupon the same shall become
immediately due and payable.

                  (b)      Possession. Mortgagee may take immediate possession
of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof (which Mortgagor agrees to
surrender to Mortgagee) and manage, control or lease the same to such person or
persons and at such rental as it may deem proper and collect all the rents,
issues and profits therefrom, including those past due as well as those
thereafter accruing, with the right in Mortgagee to cancel any lease or sublease
for any cause which would entitle Mortgagor to cancel the same; to make such
expenditures for maintenance, repairs and costs of operation as it may deem
advisable; and after deducting the cost thereof and a commission of five (5 %)
percent upon the gross amounts of rents collected (if allowed by applicable
law), to apply the residue to the payment of any sums which are unpaid hereunder
or under the Notes. The taking of possession under this paragraph shall not
prevent concurrent or later proceedings for the foreclosure sale of the
Mortgaged Property as provided elsewhere herein.

                  (c)      Receiver. Mortgagee may apply to any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver or similar official to
manage and operate the Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof, and to apply the
net rents and profits therefrom to the payment of the interest and/or principal
of the Note and/or any other obligations of Mortgagor to Mortgagee hereunder. In
event of such application, Mortgagor agrees to consent to the appointment of
such receiver or on similar official and agrees that such receiver or similar
official may be appointed without notice to Mortgagor, without regard to the
adequacy of any security for the debt and with-


                                      G-7
<PAGE>

out regard to the solvency of Mortgagor or any other person, firm or corporation
who or which may be liable for the on payment of the Indebtedness.

                  (d)      Foreclosure. Mortgagee shall have the right to
foreclose this Mortgage and in case of sale in an action or proceeding to
foreclose this Mortgage, Mortgagee shall have the right to sell the Mortgaged
Property covered hereby in parts or as an entirety. It is intended hereby to
give to Mortgagee the widest possible discretion permitted by law with respect
to all aspects of any such sale or sales. Without declaring the entire unpaid
principal balance due, Mortgagee may foreclose only as to the sum past due,
without injury to this Mortgage or the displacement or impairment of the
remainder of the Lien thereof, and at such foreclosure sale the property sold
shall be subject to all remaining items of the Indebtedness; and Mortgagee may
again foreclose, in the same manner, as often as there may be any sum past due.

                  (e)      Additional Provisions. Mortgagor expressly agrees, on
behalf of itself, its successors and assigns and any future owner of the
Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof or interest therein, as follows:

                           (i)      The obtaining of a judgment or decree on the
                  Note, whether in the State where the Premises are located or
                  elsewhere, shall not in any manner affect the lien of this
                  Mortgage upon the Mortgaged Property covered hereby, and any
                  judgment or decree so obtained shall be secured hereby to the
                  same extent as the Notes are now secured.

                           (ii)     In the event of any foreclosure sale
                  hereunder, all net proceeds shall be available for application
                  to the Indebtedness whether or not such proceeds may exceed
                  the value of the Mortgaged Property for recordation tax,
                  mortgage tax, insurance or other purposes.

                           (iii)    The only limitation upon the foregoing
                  agreements as to the exercise of Mortgagee's remedies is that
                  there shall be but one full and complete satisfaction of the
                  Indebtedness.

                  (f)      Lawsuits. Mortgagee may proceed by a suit or suits in
equity or at law, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or
agreement herein contained or in aid of the execution of any power herein
granted, or for any foreclosure hereunder or for the sale of the Mortgaged
Property under the judgment or decree of any court or courts of competent
jurisdiction.

                  (g)      Entry on Mortgaged Property. Upon occurrence of an
Event of Default hereunder, Mortgagee may enter into and upon and take
possession of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property, and may exclude
Mortgagor, and all persons


                                      G-8
<PAGE>

claiming under Mortgagor, and its or their agents or servants, wholly or partly
therefrom; and, holding the same, Mortgagee may use, administer, manage,
operate, and control the Mortgaged Property and may exercise all rights and
powers of Mortgagor in the name, place and stead of Mortgagor, or otherwise, as
the Mortgagee shall deem best; and in the exercise of any of the foregoing
rights and powers Mortgagee shall not be liable to Mortgagor for any loss or
damage thereby sustained unless due solely to the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of Mortgagee.

                  2.2      Tenancy at Will. In the event of a foreclosure sale
hereunder, if at the time of such sale Mortgagor occupies the portion of the
Mortgaged Property so sold or any part thereof, Mortgagor shall immediately
become the tenant of the purchaser at such sale, which tenancy shall be a
tenancy from day to day, terminable at the will of either tenant or landlord, at
a reasonable rental per day based upon the value of the portion of the Mortgaged
Property so occupied, such rental to be due and payable daily to the purchaser.
An action of forcible detainer shall lie if the tenant holds over after a demand
in writing for possession of such Mortgaged Property.

                  2.3      Reimbursement of Expenditure. If Mortgagee shall
expend any money or incur any expense to perform Mortgagor's obligations
hereunder, to cure any default under any Subject Lease referred to in Section
3.3, to maintain, preserve and protect the Premises or preserve the lien hereof
or otherwise subject to reimbursement by Mortgagor under the terms of the Loan
Documents, then all such sums shall be secured hereby and Mortgagor will repay
the same to Mortgagee immediately at the place where the Notes are payable,
together with interest thereon at the highest rate permitted by applicable law
from and after the date of each such expenditure by Mortgagee.

                  2.4      Other. Mortgagee may exercise any and all other
rights, remedies and recourses granted under the Loan Documents now or hereafter
existing in equity or at law for the protection and preservation of the
Mortgaged Property.

                  2.5      Remedies Cumulative Concurrent and Nonexclusive.
Mortgagee shall have all rights, remedies and recourses granted in the Loan
Documents and available at law or equity (including, without limitation, those
granted by the Code (as defined below) and applicable to the Mortgaged Property,
or any portion thereof and same (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent, (b) may
be pursued separately, successively or concurrently against Mortgagor or others
obligated for the Indebtedness, or any part thereof or against any one or more
of them, or against the Mortgaged Property, at the sole discretion of Mortgagee,
(c) may be exercised as often as occasion therefor shall arise, it being agreed
by Mortgagor that the exercise or failure to exercise any of same shall in no
event be construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other right, remedy
or recourse, and (d) are intended to be, and shall be, nonexclusive.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  3.1      Security Agreement under Uniform Commercial Code.

                  (a)      It is the intention of the parties hereto that this
Mortgage shall constitute a "security agreement" within the meaning of the
Uniform Commercial Code (the "Code") of the State in which the Mortgaged
Property is located. If an Event of Default shall occur under this Mortgage,
then in addition to having any other right or remedy available at law or in
equity, Mortgagee shall have the option of either (i) proceeding under the Code
and exercising such rights and remedies as may be provided to a secured party by
the Code with respect to all or any portion of the Mortgaged Property which is
personal property (including, without limitation, taking possession of and
selling such property) or (ii) treating such property as real property and
proceeding with respect to both the real and personal property constituting the
Mortgaged Property in accordance with Mortgagee's rights, powers and remedies
with respect to the real property (in which event the default provisions of the
Code shall not apply). If Mortgagee shall elect to proceed under the Code, then
the terms and conditions of the Security Agreement (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) of even date herewith shall govern and control all such personal
property disposition

                  (b)      Mortgagor and Mortgagee agree, to the extent
permitted by law, that: (i) all of the goods described within the definition of
the word "Equipment" are or are to become fixtures on the Real Estate; (ii) this
Mortgage upon recording or registration in the real estate records of the proper
office shall constitute a financing statement filed as a "fixture filing" within
the meaning of Sections 9-334 and 9-502 of the Code; (iii) Mortgagor is the
record owner of the Real Estate and; (iv) the addresses of Mortgagor and
Mortgagee are as set forth on the first page of this Mortgage.

                  (c)      The filing of any financing or continuation
statements in the records relating to personal property or chattels shall not be
construed as in any way impairing the right of Mortgagee to proceed against any
personal property encumbered by this Mortgage as real property, as set forth
above.

                  (d)      The provisions set forth in the Security Agreement
are hereby incorporated by reference into the Mortgage with the same effect as
if set forth in full herein. In the event of a conflict between the provisions
of this Section 3.1 and the Security Agreement, it is the intention of Mortgagor
and Mortgagee that both such documents shall be read together and construed to
the fullest extent possible to be in concert with each other. In the event of a
conflict that can not be resolved as aforesaid, the provisions of the Security
Agreement shall control and govern and Mortgagor shall comply therewith.

                  3.2      Assignment of Rents. Mortgagor hereby assigns to
Mortgagee the Rents as further security for the payment of the Indebtedness and
performance of the Obligations, and Mortgagor grants to Mortgagee the right to
enter the Mortgaged Property for the purpose of collecting the same and to let
the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, and to apply the Rents on account of
the Indebtedness. The foregoing assignment and grant is present and absolute and
shall continue in effect until the Indebtedness is paid in full, but Mortgagee
hereby waives the right to enter the Mortgaged Property for the purpose of
collecting the Rents and grants to Mortgagor a license to collect, receive, use
and retain the Rents until the occurrence of an Event of Default; such license
to Mortgagor to collect, receive, use and retain the Rents may be revoked by
Mortgagee upon the occurrence of any Event of Default under this Mortgage by
giving not less than five days' written notice of such revocation to Mortgagor.
Mortgagor shall not accept prepayments of installments of Rent to become due for
a period of more than one month in advance (except for security deposits and
estimated payments or percentage rents, if any, to the extend required to be
made under the relevant lease more than one month in advance).

                  3.3      Leaseholds. In the event that all or any portion of
the Premises is a leasehold estate, then the following provisions shall apply:

                  (a)      The name and address of the landlord and a
description of each lease (each a "Subject Lease" and collectively, the "Subject
Leases"), is set forth on Schedule 3 attached hereto;

                  (b)      If the provisions of any such Subject Lease shall not
permit the lessee thereunder to encumber its interest therein, then to the
extent that such encumbrance is not permitted, this Mortgage shall be deemed to
not apply to such lease and shall be of no further force and effect with respect
thereto.

                  (c)      Mortgagor represents and warrants that each Subject
Lease is in full force and effect and to the best of Mortgagor's knowledge, no
default has occurred and is continuing thereunder;

                  (d)      Mortgagor shall comply with all the terms, covenants
and conditions under each Subject Lease;

                  (e)      Mortgagor shall deliver to Mortgagee a copy of any
notice of default relating to any Subject Lease;

                  (f)      Subject to the rights of the lessor under the Subject
Lease, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Mortgagee shall have the
right, at its option, to enter all or any portion of the Premises at such times
and in such manner as Mortgagee deems necessary, in order to prevent or to cure
any such default;


                                      G-11
<PAGE>

                  (g)      In the event that Mortgagor acquires lessor's
interest in any Subject Lease, then this Mortgage shall automatically be a Lien
on such acquired interest; and

                  (h)      The occurrence of any event or condition which gives
the lessor under any Subject Lease a right to terminate or cancel such Subject
Lease after expiration of any applicable notice, cure or grace period under the
Subject Lease or by applicable statute, shall be an Event of Default hereunder.

                  3.4      Successors and Assigns. All covenants of Mortgagor
contained in this Mortgage are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of
Mortgagee and its successors and assigns, and no other person or entity shall
have standing to require compliance with such covenants or be deemed, under any
circumstances, to be a beneficiary of such covenants, any or all of which may be
freely waived in whole or in part by Mortgagee at any time if in its sole
discretion it deems such waiver advisable. All such covenants of Mortgagor shall
run with the land and bind Mortgagor, the successors and assigns of Mortgagor
(and each of them) and all subsequent owners, encumbrances and tenants of the
Mortgaged Property, and shall inure to the benefit of Mortgagee, its successors
and assigns. The word "Mortgagor" shall be construed as if it read "Mortgagors"
whenever the sense of this Mortgage so requires and if there shall be more than
one Mortgagor, the obligations of the Mortgagors shall be joint and several.

                  3.5      No Waivers, etc. Any failure by Mortgagee to insist
upon the strict performance by Mortgagor of any of the terms and provisions of
this Mortgage shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any of the terms and
provisions hereof, and Mortgagee, notwithstanding any such failure, shall have
the right thereafter to insist upon the strict performance by Mortgagor of any
and all of the terms and provisions of this Mortgage to be performed by
Mortgagor. Mortgagee may release, regardless of consideration and without the
necessity for any notice to or consent by the holder of any subordinate lien on
the Mortgaged Property, any part of the security held for the obligations
secured by this Mortgage without, as to the remainder of the security, in
anywise impairing or affecting the lien of this Mortgage or the priority of such
Lien over any subordinate Lien.

                  3.6      GOVERNING LAW ETC. THIS MORTGAGE AND THE OBLIGATIONS
ARISING HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN THE
STATE OF NEW YORK AND ANY APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA EXCEPT
THAT AT ALL TIMES THE PROVISIONS FOR THE CREATION, PERFECTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
OF THE LIENS AND SECURITY INTEREST CREATED PURSUANT TO THIS MORTGAGE WITH
RESPECT TO ANY PROPERTY AND PURSUANT TO THE ASSIGN-


                                      G-12
<PAGE>

MENT OF LEASES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH SUCH PROPERTY
IS LOCATED. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, EACH PROVISION OF THE MORTGAGE SHALL BE
INTERPRETED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE EFFECTIVE AND VALID UNDER APPLICABLE LAW,
BUT IF ANY PROVISION OF THE MORTGAGE SHALL BE PROHIBITED BY, OR INVALID UNDER,
APPLICABLE LAW, SUCH PROVISION SHALL BE INEFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH
PROHIBITION OR INVALIDITY WITHOUT INVALIDATING REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THE
MORTGAGE. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE MORTGAGE OR ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL REQUIRE
MORTGAGOR TO PAY OR MORTGAGEE TO ACCEPT ANY SUM IN ANY AMOUNT WHICH WOULD, UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW, SUBJECT BENEFICIARY, OR ANY TRUSTEE TO PENALTY OR ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE MORTGAGE. IN THE EVENT THAT THE PAYMENT OF ANY
SUM DUE HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT WOULD HAVE SUCH RESULT UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW, THEN, IPSO FACTO, THE OBLIGATION OF MORTGAGOR TO MAKE SUCH
PAYMENTS SHALL BE REDUCED TO THE HIGHEST SUM THEN PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW
AND APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT SHALL BE MADE BY MORTGAGOR AND MORTGAGEE.

                  3.7      Definitions. Capitalized terms not defined in this
Mortgage shall have the meanings given them in the Credit Agreement. Unless the
context clearly indicates a contrary intent or unless otherwise specifically
provided herein, words used in this Mortgage shall be used interchangeably in
singular or plural form and the word "Mortgagor" shall mean "each Mortgagor or
any subsequent owner or owners of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof or
interest therein," the word "Mortgagee" shall mean "Mortgagee or any subsequent
holder of the Notes," the word "Notes" shall mean "the Notes or any other
evidence of indebtedness secured by this Mortgage," the word "person" shall
include any individual, corporation, partnership, trust, unincorporated
association, government governmental authority, or other entity, and the words
"Mortgaged Property" shall include any portion of the Mortgaged Property or
interest therein. Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used herein
shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the
singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural and vice versa. The
captions in this Mortgage are for convenience or reference only and in no way
limit or amplify the provisions hereof.

                  3.8      Notices. All notices, consents, approvals and
requests required or permitted hereunder shall be given (i) with respect to
Mortgagor, in accordance with the Credit Agreement and (ii) with respect to
Mortgagee, at the address listed on page 1 hereof in the form and manner
provided for in the Credit Agreement.

<PAGE>

                  3.9      Change in Applicable Law. If at any time Mortgagee
reasonably determines, based on applicable law, that all applicable taxes
(including mortgage recording taxes or similar charges) were not paid in
connection with the recordation of this Mortgage or the perfection of the liens
granted pursuant to any of the Security Documents, Mortgagor shall pay the same
upon demand.

                  3.10     Severability. This Mortgage is intended to be
performed in accordance with applicable law. If any provision of this Mortgage
or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, for any reason
and to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, then neither the remainder of
this Mortgage nor the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances nor the other instruments referred to hereinabove shall be
affected thereby, but rather shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted
by applicable law.

                  3.11     Amendments and Waivers. No amendment modification,
termination or waiver of any provision of this Mortgage or consent to any
departure therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written
concurrence of Mortgagee. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice
to or demand on Mortgagor in any case shall entitle Mortgagor to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

                  3.12     Legal Descriptions. In the event that the legal
description attached to this Mortgage is inaccurate or does not fully describe
all of the Real Property in which Mortgagor has an interest, Mortgagor hereby
agrees to the amendment of such legal description and the legal description
contained in the corresponding title insurance policy (if any) so that such
error is corrected and Mortgagor shall execute and cause to be recorded, if
applicable, such documentation as may be necessary for such purpose.

                  3.13     Incorporation of and Conflict with Credit Agreement.
The terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of
the Mortgage and those of the Credit Agreement, it is the intention of Mortgagor
and Mortgagee that such documents shall be read together and construed, to the
fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of a
conflict or inconsistency that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms of the
Credit Agreement shall control.
