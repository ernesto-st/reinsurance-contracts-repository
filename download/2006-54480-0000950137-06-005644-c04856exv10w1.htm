The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Agent or any Lender Party at

amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it under each Facility pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance and, if any assigning Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder under such Facility, a
new Note to the order of such assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it
hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such
