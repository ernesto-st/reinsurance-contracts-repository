         2.1      Loan.

                  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance
upon the representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, each Lender
severally agrees to lend to the Borrower on the Closing Date its portion of a
term loan (the "Loan") in an amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding
the amount set forth next to such Lender's name on Exhibit A. Amounts borrowed
under this Section 2.1 that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.

         2.2      Making the Loan.

                  (a)      The Loan shall be made upon notice from the Borrower
to each of the Lenders, which notice shall be received by not later than 11:00
A.M. (New York city time) on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date. Such
notice (the "Notice of Loan") shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower,
and shall be given in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.2 hereto.
After the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section 4, the Lenders will
make such funds available to the Borrower by crediting an account at Bankers

any fees, expenses or other amounts owing to the Lenders or any of their
respective Affiliates by the Borrower on the date of the Loan in connection with
the Credit Documents.

                  (b)      The failure of any Lender to make its portion of the
Loan to be made by it shall relieve each other Lender of its obligation, if any,
hereunder to make its portion of the Loan on the Closing Date.

                  (c)      Repayment. The principal amount of the Loan shall be
due and payable in full on the Maturity Date unless accelerated sooner pursuant
to Section 8.2.

                  (d)      Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1,
interest on the Loan shall be computed from the Closing Date on the basis of
actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate, at
an interest rate set forth in the Note, the form of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.2(e).

                  (e)      Note. The portion of the Loan made by each Lender
shall be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note of the Borrower to such
Lender in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.2(e).

                                    SECTION 3

         3.1      Default Rate.

                  Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event
of Default the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the
Loan and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
shall bear interest, payable on demand as set forth in the Note, the form of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.2(e).

         3.2      Prepayments.

                  (a)      Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the
right at its option to prepay the Loan in whole or in part at any time between
the Closing Date and the first anniversary thereof at a price equal to 103% of
the principal amount thereof, from the first anniversary to the second
anniversary at a price equal to 102% of the principal amount thereof, from the
second anniversary to the third anniversary at a price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof and at 100% of the principal amount thereafter, plus,
in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment.





<PAGE>   37

                                      -32-


                  The Borrower shall prepay the Loan on the following terms and
conditions: (i) the Borrower shall give each Lender written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay the
Loan and the amount of such prepayment, which notice shall be given by the
Borrower to each Lender at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of
such prepayment; (ii) each partial prepayment of the Loan shall be in an
aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000,000 in excess of that amount; and (iii) each partial prepayment of the
Loan shall be applied pro rata to the Lenders in accordance with the unpaid
principal of the portion of the Loan held by them immediately prior to such
repayment. All prepayments under this Section 3.2(a) shall be accompanied by
interest on the principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

                  (b)      Make-whole Premium. In the event of acceleration of
the Loan pursuant to Section 8, the Borrower will prepay all Loans at a
redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus a make-whole premium
equal to the remaining cash interest payments (calculated on the basis of the
Prime Rate in effect on the date of such acceleration) that would have been
paid, discounted at the yield prevailing for U.S. Treasury obligations maturing
closest to the Maturity Date, plus 50 basis points.

                  (c)      Mandatory Prepayments with the Proceeds of Asset
Dispositions. (i) So long as the Existing Credit Agreement is in effect, the
Borrower must comply with Section 3.3 thereof and must apply any remaining Net
Cash Proceeds (the "Net Cash Proceeds Amount") not utilized to repay borrowings
under the Existing Credit Agreement to make an offer (a "Net Cash Proceeds
Offer") to prepay the Loan in an amount up to such remaining Net Cash Proceeds
at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, if any, to the date of payment.

                           (ii)     Each Net Cash Proceeds Offer will be mailed
to the Lenders within five days of such Net Cash Proceeds not being utilized
pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Existing Credit Agreement, with a copy to the
Agent. Upon receiving notice of the Net Cash Proceeds Offer, each Lender may
elect, within the period the Net Cash Proceeds Offer is open, to have its
portion of the Loan prepaid. To the extent any Lender notifies the Borrower of
its intention to receive a prepayment, the respective portion of the Loan of
each Lender will be prepaid on a pro rata basis (based on outstanding principal
amount of each Lender's portion of the Loan) on the Business Day next succeeding


<PAGE>   38

                                      -33-

the last day of the Net Cash Proceeds Offer. A Net Cash Proceeds Offer shall
remain open for a period of 20 Business Days.

                          (iii)     If the Existing Credit Agreement is no
longer in effect, immediately upon the occurrence of any Asset Disposition
(other than an Excluded Asset Disposition), the Borrower shall prepay the Loan
in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds of the related
Asset Disposition.

         3.3      Taxes.

                  (a)      Any and all payments by any Credit Party to or for
the account of any Lender or under any other Credit Document shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the
Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) is organized or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded
taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings, and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Credit Party shall
be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
under this Agreement or any other Credit Document to any Lender, (i) the sum
payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 3.3) such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall make
such deductions, (iii) such Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
law, and (iv) such Credit Party shall furnish to such Lender the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

                  (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all
present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property
taxes or charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made under this
Agreement or any other Credit Document or from the execution or delivery of, or
otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Credit Document
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").




<PAGE>   39

                                      -34-

                  (c)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for the
full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes
or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
this Section 3.3) paid by such Lender and any liability (including penalties,
interest, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.

                  (d)      If any Credit Party is required to pay additional
amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.3, then
such Lender that is a Bank will agree to use reasonable efforts to change the
jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any
such additional payment that may thereafter accrue if such change, in the
judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (e)      Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment
of Taxes, the applicable Credit Party shall furnish to the Lenders the original
or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment.

                  (f)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Credit Parties contained in this Section 3.3 shall survive the repayment of the
Loans and other obligations under the Credit Documents.

         3.4      Compensation.

                  Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion
of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense incurred by it
as a result of any failure by the Borrower for any reason to prepay a Loan on
the date for such prepayment specified in the relevant notice of prepayment
under this Agreement (including without limitation pursuant to Section 3.2(c) or
7.12).

                  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Credit Parties hereunder, the covenants of the Borrower set forth in this
Section 3.4 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and other obligations under
the Credit Documents (including without limitation pursuant to Section 3.2(c) or
7.12).

         3.5      Pro Rata Treatment.

                  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, the Loan and
each payment or prepayment of principal of the Loan, shall be allocated pro rata
among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their
outstanding portion of the Loan.

         3.6      Intentionally Omitted.

         3.7      Payments, Computations, Etc.

                  (a)      Procedure for Payments. All payments hereunder shall
be made to the Agent in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction,
counterclaim or withholding of any kind, at the Agent's office specified in
Section 10.1 hereto not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date
when due. Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such
time to any ordinary deposit account of the Borrower or any other Credit Party
maintained with the Agent (with notice to the Borrower or such other Credit
Party). The Agent will promptly distribute in same day funds to each Lender such
Lender's share, if any, of payments received by the Agent for the account of
such Lender. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day
which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and fees for the period
of such extension). Interest shall accrue from and including the date of
borrowing, to, but not including, the date of payment.

                  (b)      Allocation of Payments After Event of Default.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts
collected or received by the Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit Party
Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents
or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows:

                  FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees)

         under the Credit Documents and any protective advances made by the
         Agent with respect



<PAGE>   41

                                      -36-

         to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the Collateral
         Documents;

                  SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent under the
         Credit Documents;

                  THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under
         the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party
         Obligations owing to such Lender;

                  FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations
         consisting of accrued fees and interest;

                  FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of
         the Credit Party Obligations;

                  SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other
         obligations that shall have become due and payable under the Credit
         Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST"
         through "FIFTH" above; and

                  SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may
         be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category; and (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal
to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans
held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Loans) of amounts
available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and
"SIXTH" above.

         3.8      Evidence of Debt.

                  (a)      Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts
evidencing the portion of the Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower,
including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender

accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or
accounts from time to time, as necessary.

                  (b)      The Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to

subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such

subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.8 (and, if
consistent with the entries of the Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Credit Parties
therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Agent
to maintain any such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable,
or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
Credit Parties to repay the Credit Party Obligations owing to such Lender.

                                      -43-


         5.1      Financial Condition.

                  The audited consolidated balance sheet and income statement of
the Consolidated Parties for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 have
heretofore been furnished to the Lenders. Such financial statements (including
the notes thereto) (i) have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, (ii) have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently (except for departures from GAAP
described in Section 1.2 hereof), applied throughout the periods covered thereby
and (iii) present fairly (on the basis disclosed in the footnotes to such
financial statements) the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows of the Consolidated Parties as of such date and for
such period. During the period from December 31, 2000 to and including the
Closing Date, there has been no sale, transfer or other disposition by any
Consolidated Party of any material part of the business or property of the
Consolidated Parties, taken as a whole, and no purchase or other acquisition by
any of them of any business or property (including any capital stock of any
other person) material in relation to the consolidated financial condition of
the Consolidated Parties, taken as a whole, in each case, that is not reflected
in the foregoing financial statements or in the notes thereto and has not
otherwise been disclosed in writing to the Lenders on or prior to the Closing
Date.

         5.2      No Material Change.

                  Since December 31, 2000, (a) there has been no development or
event relating to or affecting a Consolidated Party that has had or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (b) except as
disclosed on Schedule 5.2(b), no dividends or other distributions have been
declared, paid or made upon the Capital Stock in a Consolidated Party nor has
any of the Capital Stock in a Consolidated Party been redeemed, retired,
purchased or otherwise acquired for value.

         5.3      Organization and Good Standing.

                  Each of the Consolidated Parties (a) is duly organized,
validly existing and is in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, (b) has the corporate or other necessary
power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to
lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it
is currently engaged and (c) is duly qualified as a foreign entity and in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or
operation of property
<PAGE>   49

                                      -44-

or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.4      Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.

                  Each of the Credit Parties has the corporate or other
necessary power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform
the Credit Documents to which it is a party, and in the case of the Borrower, to
obtain extensions of credit hereunder, and has taken all necessary corporate
action to authorize the borrowings and other extensions of credit on the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of the Credit Documents to which it is a party. No consent or
authorization of, filing with, notice to or other similar act by or in respect
of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required to be obtained or
made by or on behalf of any Credit Party in connection with the borrowings or
other extensions of credit hereunder or with the execution, delivery,
performance, validity or enforceability of the Credit Documents to which such
Credit Party is a party, except for (i) consents, authorizations, notices and
filings described in Schedule 5.4, all of which have been obtained or made or
have the status described in such Schedule 5.4, and (ii) filings to perfect the
Liens created by the Collateral Documents. This Agreement has been, and each
other Credit Document to which any Credit Party is a party will be, duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the Credit Parties. This Agreement
constitutes, and each other Credit Document to which any Credit Party is a party
when executed and delivered will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Credit Party enforceable against such party in accordance
with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles
(whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

         5.5      No Conflicts.

                  Neither the execution and delivery of the Credit Documents,
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor performance
of and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof by any Credit Party will
(a) violate or conflict with any provision of its articles or certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational

<PAGE>   50

                                      -45-

or governing documents of such Person, (b) violate, contravene or materially
conflict with any Requirement of Law or any other law, regulation (including,
without limitation, Regulation U or Regulation X), order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or permit applicable to it, (c) violate, contravene or
conflict with contractual provisions of, or cause an event of default under, any
indenture, loan agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, contract or other agreement
or instrument to which it is a party or by which it may be bound, the violation
of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (d)
result in or require the creation of any Lien (other than those contemplated in
or created in connection with the Credit Documents) upon or with respect to its
properties.

         5.6      No Default.

                  No Consolidated Party is in default in any respect under any
contract, lease, loan agreement, indenture, mortgage, security agreement or
other agreement or obligation to which it is a party or by which any of its
properties is bound which default could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred or exists.

         5.7      Ownership.

                  Each Consolidated Party is the owner of, and has good and
marketable title to, all of its respective assets and none of such assets is
subject to any Lien other than Permitted Liens.

         5.8      Indebtedness.

                  Except as otherwise permitted under Section 7.1, the
Consolidated Parties have no Indebtedness.

         5.9      Litigation.

                  Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.9, there are no actions,
suits or legal, equitable, arbitration or administrative proceedings, pending
or, to the knowledge of any Credit Party, threatened against any Consolidated
Party that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.10     Tax Returns, Payments and Examinations.

                  Each Consolidated Party has filed or caused to be filed all
federal tax returns and all material state and local tax returns which are
required to be filed, and has paid all
<PAGE>   51

                                      -46-

material taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments
made against it or any of its respective properties and all material taxes, fees
and other charges imposed on it or any of its respective properties by any
governmental authority (other than those the amount or validity of which is
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which
reserves in accordance with GAAP have been provided on the books of such
Consolidated Party); and no tax Liens have been filed and no claims are being
asserted with respect to any such taxes, fees or other charges (other than such
Liens or claims, the amount or validity of which is currently being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in
accordance with GAAP have been provided). Except as set forth on Schedule 5.10
hereto, the federal income tax returns of each Consolidated Party have been
examined by the Internal Revenue Service (or closed by applicable statues) for
all tax periods, and there are no other federal income tax examinations in
progress. All deficiencies that have been asserted against any Consolidated
Party as a result of such examinations have been fully paid or finally settled
or are being contested in good faith, and no issue has been raised in any such
examinations which, by application or similar principles, reasonably can be
expected to result in assertion of a deficiency for any other year not so
examined that has not been accrued on such Consolidated Party's audited
financial statements for its most recently ended fiscal year that would be
required to be so accrued in accordance with GAAP. The Borrower has no knowledge
of any material federal income tax liability for any Consolidated Party with
respect to open taxable years in excess of amounts accrued on its consolidated
financial statements for its most recently ended fiscal year that would be
required to be so accrued in accordance with GAAP, nor does the Borrower
anticipate any further material tax liability with respect to such open taxable
years taken as a whole in excess of such accrued amounts.

         5.11     Compliance with Law.

                  Each Consolidated Party is in compliance with all Requirements
of Law and all other laws, rules, regulations, orders and decrees (including
without limitation Environmental Laws) applicable to it, or to its properties,
unless such failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No Requirement of Law could reasonably be expected to
cause a Material Adverse Effect.

                                      -47-

         5.12     ERISA.

                  Except as disclosed and described in Schedule 5.12 attached
hereto:

                  (a)      During the five-year period prior to the date on
         which this representation is made or deemed made: (i) no ERISA Event
         has occurred, and, to the best knowledge of the Credit Parties, no
         event or condition has occurred or exists as a result of which any
         ERISA Event could reasonably be expected to occur, with respect to any
         Plan; (ii) no "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is defined
         in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or not
         waived, has occurred with respect to any Plan; (iii) each Plan has been
         maintained, operated and funded in material compliance with its own
         terms and in material compliance with the provisions of ERISA, the Code
         and any other applicable federal or state laws; (iv) no lien in favor
         of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen or is reasonably likely to arise on
         account of any Plan; and (v) none of the Credit Parties is a "party in
         interest" (within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA) to any
         employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA)
         which has assets under investment.

                  (b)      The accumulated benefit obligation (within the
         meaning of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 87
         ("FASB87")) under each Single Employer Plan utilizing the actuarial and
         other assumptions employed in calculating the FASB87 disclosure in the
         Borrower's most recent annual financial statement did not exceed the
         fair market value of the assets of such Plan as of the date of such
         financial statement.

                  (c)      Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA
         Affiliate has incurred, or, to the best knowledge of the Credit
         Parties, could be reasonably expected to incur, any withdrawal
         liability under ERISA to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
         Plan. Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA Affiliate would
         become subject to any withdrawal liability under ERISA if any
         Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw completely
         from all Multiemployer Plans and Multiple Employer Plans as of the
         valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this
         representation is made or deemed made. Neither any Consolidated Party
         nor any ERISA Affiliate has received any notification that any
         Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section
         4241 of ERISA),


<PAGE>   53

                                      -48-

         is insolvent (within the meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA), or has been
         terminated (within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA), and no
         Multiemployer Plan is, to the best knowledge of the Credit Parties,
         reasonably expected to be in reorganization, insolvent or terminated.

                  (d)      No prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
         Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of
         fiduciary responsibility has occurred with respect to a Plan which has
         subjected any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate to any
         liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or Section

                  (e)      Other than as reflected fairly in the Borrower's most

and nonassessable and is owned by each such Consolidated Party, directly or
indirectly, free and clear of all Liens (other than those arising under or
contemplated in connection with the Credit Documents). Other than as set forth

carrying or trading in any securities. If requested by any Lender or the Agent,
the Borrower will furnish to the Agent and each Lender a statement to the
foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to
in Regulation U. No indebtedness being reduced or retired out of the proceeds of
the Loans was or will be incurred for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any
margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U or any "margin security" within
the meaning of Regulation T. "Margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U

Consolidated Parties. None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the direct or indirect use of the proceeds of
the Loans) will violate or result in a violation of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or regulations
issued pursuant thereto, or Regulation T, U or X.

                  (b)      No Consolidated Party is subject to regulation under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act or the
Investment Company Act of 1940, each as amended. In addition, no Consolidated
Party is (i) an "investment company" registered or required to be registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not controlled by
such a company, or (ii) a "holding company", or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary"

Regulation O). For the purposes hereof the terms "director", "executive officer"
and "principal shareholder" (when used with reference to any Lender) also have
the respective meanings assigned thereto in Regulation O issued by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

                  (n)      Monthly Financial Information.  The Borrower shall:

<PAGE>   65
                                      -60-

                  provide such calculation by the forty-fifth (45th) calendar
                  day after the end of such fiscal quarter, and provided,
                  further, at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of any fiscal
                  year, the Borrower shall provide such calculation by the
                  ninety-fifth (95th) calendar day after the end of the fiscal

                  next succeeding 13 weeks, and (3) a schedule summarizing all
                  of the Funded Indebtedness of the Credit Parties.

                  All such financial information described in this Section
         6.1(n) shall be in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the
         Agent. The monthly financial statements delivered pursuant to Section
         6.1(n)(i) shall be accompanied by a certificate of the chief financial
         officer, treasurer or controller of the Borrower to the effect that
         such monthly financial statements fairly present in all material
         respects the financial condition of the Consolidated Parties and have
         been prepared in accordance with GAAP, subject to changes resulting
         from audit and normal year-end audit adjustments.

         6.2      Preservation of Existence and Franchises.

                  Except as a result of or in connection with a dissolution,
merger or disposition of a Subsidiary permitted under Section 7.4 or Section
7.5, the Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, do all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence,
rights, franchises and authority.

         6.3      Books and Records.

                  The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
keep complete and accurate books and records of its transactions in accordance
with good accounting practices on the basis of GAAP, except for departures from
GAAP (i) which are not material, (ii) which will not cause the financial
statements to fail to meet the requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for financial information to be contained or incorporated by
reference in registration statements, and (iii) which do not cause the financial
statements to fail
<PAGE>   66
                                      -61-

to reflect accurately in all respects the financial condition of the Borrower.

         6.4      Compliance with Law.

                  The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders, and all applicable
restrictions imposed by all Governmental Authorities, applicable to it and its
Property if noncompliance with any such law, rule, regulation, order or
restriction could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.5      Payment of Taxes and Other Indebtedness.

                  The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
pay and discharge (a) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies
imposed upon it, or upon its income or profits, or upon any of its Properties,
before they shall become delinquent, and (b) all lawful claims (including claims
for labor, materials and supplies) which, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien
upon any of its Properties; provided, however, that no Consolidated Party shall
be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy, or claim which is
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which
adequate reserves therefor have been established in accordance with GAAP, unless
the failure to make any such payment (i) could give rise to an immediate right
to foreclose on a Lien securing such amounts or (ii) could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.6      Insurance.

                  (a)      The Borrower will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, at all times maintain in full force and effect insurance
(including worker's compensation insurance, liability insurance, property
insurance and business interruption insurance) in such amounts, covering such
risks and liabilities and with such deductibles or self-insurance retentions as
are in accordance with reasonable business practices. The Agent shall be named
as loss payee or mortgagee, as its interest may appear, and additional insured,
as appropriate, with respect to any such insurance providing coverage in respect
of any Collateral, and each provider of any such insurance shall agree, by
endorsement upon the policy or policies issued by it or by independent
instruments furnished to the Agent, that it will give the Agent thirty (30) days
prior written notice before the coverage of any such policy or policies shall be
materially
<PAGE>   67
                                      -62-

altered or canceled, and that no act or default of any Consolidated Party or any
other Person shall affect the rights of the Agent or the Lenders under such
policy or policies. Such policies may provide that, prior to written
notification from the Agent of the incurrence of an Event of Default, the
insurer may make settlement payments in respect of such policies directly to the
Borrower notwithstanding the Agent's status as a loss payee, for payments
aggregating less than $5 million for any single casualty, loss or damage
incurred by any of the Credit Parties and not exceeding an aggregate of $10
million for all such payments made during any twelve month period by such
insurer or its Affiliates. The present insurance coverage of the Consolidated
Parties is outlined as to carrier, policy number, expiration date, type and
amount on Schedule 6.6.

                  (b)      In case of any material loss, damage to or
destruction of the Collateral of any Credit Party or any part thereof, such
Credit Party shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Agent generally
describing the nature and extent of such damage or destruction. In case of any
loss, damage to or destruction of the Collateral of any Credit Party or any part
thereof, such Credit Party, whether or not the insurance proceeds, if any,
received on account of such damage or destruction shall be sufficient for that
purpose, at such Credit Party's cost and expense, will promptly repair or
replace the Collateral of such Credit Party so lost, damaged or destroyed;
provided, however, that such Credit Party need not repair or replace the
Collateral of such Credit Party so lost, damaged or destroyed to the extent the
failure to make such repair or replacement (i) is desirable to the proper
conduct of the business of such Credit Party in the ordinary course and
otherwise in the best interest of such Credit Party; and (ii) would not
materially impair the rights and benefits of the Agent or the Lenders under the
Collateral Documents or any other Credit Document. Notwithstanding any provision
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the Credit Parties shall
undertake replacement or restoration of any lost, damaged or destroyed
Collateral of such Credit Party with insurance proceeds in respect thereof
unless the Agent has received evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that the
Collateral lost, damaged or destroyed has been or will be replaced or restored
to its condition immediately prior to the loss, destruction or other event
giving rise to the payment of such insurance proceeds.

         6.7      Maintenance of Property.

                  The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
maintain and preserve its properties and equipment
<PAGE>   68
                                      -63-

material to the conduct of its business in good repair, working order and
condition, normal wear and tear and casualty and condemnation excepted, and will
make, or cause to be made, in such properties and equipment from time to time
all repairs, renewals, replacements, extensions, additions, betterments and
improvements thereto as may be needed or proper, to the extent and in the manner
customary for companies in similar businesses.

         6.8      Performance of Obligations.

                  The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
perform in all respects all of its obligations under the terms of all
agreements, indentures, mortgages, security agreements or other debt instruments
to which it is a party or by which it is bound, except in any instance where the
failure to perform such obligations does not have and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.9      Use of Proceeds.

                  The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loans in accordance
with Section 5.15.

         6.10     Audits/Inspections.

                  Upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, the
Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit each Lender
and representatives appointed by the Agent, including, without limitation,
independent accountants, agents, attorneys, and appraisers to visit and inspect
its property, including its books and records, its accounts receivable and
inventory, its facilities and its other business assets, and to make photocopies
or photographs thereof and to write down and record any information such
representative obtains and shall permit each Lender and the Agent or its
representatives to investigate and verify the accuracy of information provided
to the Lenders and to discuss all such matters with the officers, employees and
representatives of such Person. The Borrower agrees that the Agent, and its
representatives and designees, may conduct audits of the Collateral from time to
time, in the discretion of the Agent and that the Credit Parties shall reimburse
the Agent for the costs and expenses of up to two audits during any fiscal year.

         6.11     Financial Covenants.

                  The Borrower shall:

         each fiscal quarter of the Consolidated Parties, commencing with the
         fiscal quarter ending June 30, 1998, by an amount equal to forty
         percent (40%) of Consolidated Net Income (to the extent positive) for
         the fiscal quarter then ended, and (iii) further increased on a
         cumulative basis by fifty percent (50%) of Consolidated Net Income (to
         the extent positive) for the period October 1, 1998 through September
         30, 1999.

                  (b)      Minimum Current Ratio. Have at all times a Current

         fiscal quarter an Interest Coverage Ratio that is not less than the
         corresponding ratio indicated (it being understood and agreed that, for

         quarters ending September 30, 2001, December 31, 2001 and March 31,

         Mortgaged Instruments shall secure Indebtedness in the Designated
         Amount for each Mortgaged Property in Alabama.

         the fair market value of the applicable Mortgaged Property as
         identified in the Valuation Certificate and (2) 200% of the book value
         of the applicable Mortgaged Property as identified in the Valuation
         Certificate; provided, however, that in the case of the Mortgaged
         Property located in Florida, such amount shall not be less than

Subsidiaries may enter into transactions with Affiliates in the ordinary course
of business, provided that the terms of such transactions are no less favorable

                  The Borrower will not (a) permit any other Consolidated Party

         7.12     Sale Leasebacks.

                  The Borrower will not permit any Consolidated Party, directly
or indirectly, to become or remain liable as lessee or as guarantor or other
surety with respect to any lease of any Property (whether real, personal or
mixed), whether now owned or hereafter acquired, (a) which such Consolidated
Party has sold or transferred or is to sell or transfer to a Person that is not
a Consolidated Party, or (b) which such Consolidated party intends to use for
substantially the same purpose as any other Property that has been sold or is to
be sold or transferred by such Consolidated Party to another Person that is not
a Consolidated Party in connection with such lease, unless, in each case, such
transaction is structured as a Synthetic Lease or Operating Lease and (w) the
aggregate consideration to be received by such Consolidated Party on account of
its sale, transfer or other disposition of such Property shall not be less than
the fair market value for such property and shall be in the form of cash or cash
equivalents, (x) no later than 10 Business Days prior to such sale, transfer or
other disposition, the Agent and the Lenders shall have received a certificate
of an officer of the Borrower specifying the anticipated or actual date of such
transaction, briefly describing the Property to be sold, transferred or disposed
of, and the estimated Net Cash Proceeds to be received for such Property, (y)
the Borrower shall have delivered to the agent a Pro Forma Compliance
Certificate demonstrating that, upon giving effect on a pro forma basis to such
transaction, no Default or Event
<PAGE>   85
                                      -80-


of Default would exist hereunder, and (z) within the period of 5 Business Days
following the consummation of such sale, transfer or other disposition, the
Borrower shall (or cause its Subsidiaries to) prepay the Loan in a principal
amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds received in connection with such sale and
transfer or other disposition, if any, remaining after the Borrower complies
with Section 8.12 of the Existing Credit Agreement; provided, however, the
aggregate consideration received in all such transactions by any Consolidated
Party shall not exceed $50,000,000 in the aggregate from and after the Closing
Date and after giving effect to each such transaction. In case of any conflict
between this Section and Section 7.5 in the instance of any Sale Leaseback
Transaction, this Section 7.12 shall control. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, no sale, transfer or other conveyance of Property as part of a
Sale Leaseback Transaction shall constitute an Excluded Asset Disposition.

         7.13     No Negative Pledges.

                  The Borrower will not permit any Consolidated Party to enter
into, assume or become subject to any agreement prohibiting or otherwise
restricting the creation or assumption of any Lien upon its properties or
assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or requiring the grant of any
security for such obligation if security is given for some other obligation,
except (a) pursuant to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, (b)
pursuant to the documents executed in connection with any Permitted Receivables
Financing (but only to the extent that the related prohibitions against other
encumbrances pertain to the applicable Transferred Assets actually sold,
contributed, financed or otherwise conveyed or pledged pursuant to such
Permitted Receivables Financing), (c) pursuant to any document or instrument
governing Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 7.1(c), provided that any
such restriction contained therein relates only to the asset or assets
constructed or acquired in connection therewith, (d) pursuant to the Existing
Credit Agreement and (e) pursuant to any document or instrument executed only by
one or more Foreign Subsidiaries of the Borrower in connection with their
obtaining financing in foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct business (to
the extent such financing is otherwise permitted by Section 7.1 hereof),
provided that any such restriction relates only to the assets owned by such
Foreign Subsidiaries and does not restrict any pledge of Capital Stock by a
direct Foreign Subsidiary of any Credit Party in favor of the Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders.
<PAGE>   86
                                      -81-


         7.14     Operating Lease Obligations.

                  The Borrower will not permit any Consolidated Party to enter
into, assume or permit to exist any Operating Leases, except that the Borrower

which any of them is a party on the Closing Date and may enter into or assume
new Operating Leases in the ordinary course of its business.

         7.15     Dividends and Other Distributions.

                  The Borrower will not permit any Consolidated Party to declare
or pay any dividend on, or purchase or redeem any shares of, any class of
Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of the Borrower (except pursuant to a merger
permitted by Section 7.4), or make any other payment or distribution on or in
respect of any class of Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of the Borrower or set
aside any amounts for any such purpose, except:

                  (i)      any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower may
         declare and pay dividends to the Borrower or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary
         of the Borrower; and

                  (ii)     any Subsidiary of the Borrower may distribute shares
         of its common stock to holders of the same or another class of its
         common stock as a stock dividend or in connection with a stock split.

         7.16     Environmental Liabilities.

                  The Borrower will not permit any Consolidated Party to become
subject to any liabilities, obligations or costs which the Agent reasonably
deems have or are likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the condition
(financial or otherwise), properties, business or results of operations of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole arising out of or relating to (i)
the Release or threatened Release at any location of any Material of
Environmental Concern into the environment, or any remedial action in response
thereto, or (ii) any violation of any environmental, health or safety
requirement under federal, state or local laws; provided, however, that prior to
the date that the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower is required to pay
such liability this covenant shall not be violated so long as (A) the Borrower
shall have notified the Agent of the assertion of such liability or required
expenditures promptly upon obtaining knowledge of such assertion, (B) the
Borrower shall have continued to furnish the Agent with such information
concerning such asserted
<PAGE>   87
                                      -82-


liability or required expenditure as the Agent shall have reasonably requested,
or as otherwise provided herein and (C) the Borrower or such Subsidiary shall,
to the extent deemed appropriate in its business judgment, be diligently
pursuing indemnification for such liability or required expenditures from any
Person which has an obligation to provide such indemnification.

         7.17     Futures Contracts.

                  The Borrower will not permit any Consolidated Party to
purchase, sell or otherwise deal with contracts for the future delivery of
goods, commodities or services, or in commodities options, including, without
limitation, cotton futures, except for hedge transactions or hedging positions
in a contract for future delivery of goods, commodities, or services, where such
transactions or positions represent a substitute for transactions to be made or
positions to be taken at a later time and where such transactions or positions
are economically appropriate to the reduction of risks in the conduct and
management of the Consolidated Parties' respective businesses, provided,
however, that Hedging Agreements are not limited by this provision.

         7.18     Inactive Subsidiaries.

                  The Borrower will not permit any Consolidated Party to
transfer any asset or assets (including Capital Stock) with an aggregate value

Subsidiary to engage in any business activity unless such Inactive Subsidiary is
then a Guarantor and Grantor under the Collateral Trust Agreement.

                  Subject to the provisions with respect to the Existing Credit

Existing Credit Agreement in any manner adverse to the Lenders (including

                                      -85-


         thereto, if any) with respect to any such Indebtedness, or (2) the
         occurrence and continuance of an event of default (and after any
         applicable grace period) in the observance or performance relating to
         such Indebtedness or contained in any instrument or agreement
         evidencing, securing or relating thereto, or any other event or
         condition shall occur or exist, the effect of which event or condition
         is to cause, or permit, the holder or holders of such Indebtedness (or
         trustee or agent on behalf of such holders) to cause, any such
         Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; or (B) any

         paid or fully covered by insurance provided by a carrier who has
         acknowledged coverage and has the ability to perform) and any such
         judgments or decrees shall not have been vacated, discharged or stayed
         or bonded pending appeal within 30 days from the entry thereof; or

         is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether
         or not waived, shall exist with respect to any Plan, or any lien shall
         arise on the assets of any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate in
         favor of the PBGC or a Plan; (ii) an ERISA Event shall occur with
         respect to a Single Employer Plan, which is, in the reasonable opinion
         of the Agent, likely to result in the termination of such Plan for
         purposes of Title IV of ERISA; (iii) an ERISA Event shall occur with
         respect to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, that is, in
         the reasonable opinion of the Agent, likely to result in (A) the
         termination of such Plan for purposes of Title IV of ERISA, or (B) any
         Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate incurring any liability in
         connection with a withdrawal from, reorganization of (within the
         meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), or insolvency of (within the meaning
         of Section 4245 of ERISA) such Plan; or (iv) any prohibited transaction
         (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
         Code) or breach of fiduciary responsibility


<PAGE>   91
                                      -86-


         shall occur that may subject any Consolidated Party or any ERISA
         Affiliate to any liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l)
         of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or other
         instrument pursuant to which any Consolidated Party or any ERISA
         Affiliate has agreed or is required to indemnify any person against any
         such liability; or

                  (j)      Senior Note Indentures. There shall occur and be
         continuing any Event of Default under and as defined in the Senior Note
         Indentures; or

                  (k)      Ownership.  There shall occur a Change of Control; or

                  (l)      Uninsured Loss. There occurs any material uninsured
         damage to, or loss, theft or destruction of, or material environmental
         impairment to, any material portion of the Collateral.

         8.2      Acceleration; Remedies.

                  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and at any time
thereafter unless and until such Event of Default has been waived by the
requisite Lenders (pursuant to the voting requirements of Section 10.6) or cured
to the satisfaction of the requisite Lenders (pursuant to the voting procedures
in Section 10.6), the Agent shall, upon the request and direction of the
Required Lenders, by written notice to the Credit Parties take any of the
following actions:

                  (a)      Acceleration. Declare the unpaid principal of and any
         accrued interest in respect of all Loans and any and all other
         indebtedness or obligations of any and every kind owing by the Credit
         Parties to the Agent and/or any of the Lenders hereunder to be due
         whereupon the same shall be immediately due and payable without
         presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
         are hereby waived by the Credit Parties.

                  (b)      Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and
         interests created and existing under the Credit Documents including,
         without limitation, all rights and remedies existing under the
         Collateral Documents, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and
         all rights of set-off.

<PAGE>   92
                                      -87-

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default
specified in Section 8.1(f) shall occur with respect to the Borrower, then all
Loans, all accrued interest in respect thereof, all accrued indebtedness or
obligations owing to the Agent and/or any of the Lenders hereunder automatically
shall immediately become due and payable without the giving of any notice or
other action by the Agent or the Lenders.

                                   SECTION 9

                               AGENCY PROVISIONS

         9.1      Appointment, Powers and Immunities.

                  Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Agent to act as its agent under this Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and
the other Credit Documents with such powers and discretion as are specifically
delegated to the Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent (which term as used in this sentence and in Section 9.4 and the first
sentence of Section 9.5 hereof shall include its Affiliates and its own and its
Affiliates' officers, directors, employees, and agents): (a) shall not have any
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement
and shall not be a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender; (b) shall not be
responsible to the Lenders for any recital, statement by any Credit Party,
representation, or warranty (whether written or oral) made in or in connection
with any Credit Document or any certificate or other document referred to or
provided for in, or received by any of them under, any Credit Document, or for
the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, or sufficiency
of any Credit Document, or any other document referred to or provided for
therein or for any failure by any Credit Party or any other Person to perform
any of its obligations thereunder; (c) shall not be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify the performance or observance of any
covenants or agreements by any Credit Party or the satisfaction of any condition
or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any Credit Party
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (d) shall not be required to initiate
or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings under any Credit Document;
and (e) shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
it under or in connection with any Credit Document, except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct.
<PAGE>   93
                                      -88-



The Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible
for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.

         9.2      Reliance by Agent.

                  The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certification,
notice, instrument, writing, or other communication (including, without
limitation, any thereof by telephone or telecopy) believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by or on behalf of the proper
Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including
independent outside counsel for any Credit Party), independent accountants, and
other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of
any Note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until the
Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance executed in accordance
with Section 10.3(b) hereof. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement, the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or
take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and
shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the
instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding on
all of the Lenders; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to
take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary
to any Credit Document or applicable law or unless it shall first be indemnified
to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking any such action.

         9.3      Defaults.

                  The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of
the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Agent has received
written notice from a Lender or a Credit Party specifying such Default or Event
of Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event
that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Agent
shall (subject to Section 9.2 hereof) take such action with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably be directed by the Required
Lenders (including without limitation, giving the notice referred to in Section
8.1(c)(iii)), provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received such
directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action,

<PAGE>   94
                                      -89-


or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders, except
to the extent that other provisions of this Agreement expressly require that any
such action be taken only with the consent, direction or authorization of the
Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable.

         9.4      Indemnification.

                  The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed under Section 10.5 hereof, but without limiting the obligations of
the Credit Parties under such Section) ratably in accordance with the respective
principal amount of their outstanding portion of the Loan, for any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), or disbursements of any kind and
nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Agent (including by any Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of any
Credit Document or the transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or
omitted by the Agent under any Credit Document; provided that no Lender shall be
liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or the Person to be indemnified.
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent
promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or expenses payable by
the Credit Parties under Section 10.5, to the extent that the Agent is not
promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Credit Parties. The
agreements in this Section 9.4 shall survive the repayment of the Loan and other
obligations under the Credit Documents.

         9.5      Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders.

                  Each Lender agrees that it has, independently and without
reliance on the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the
Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries and decision to enter into this Agreement
and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not
taking action under the Credit Documents. Except for notices, reports, and other
documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,



<PAGE>   95
                                      -90-


financial condition, or business of any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates that may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its
Affiliates.

         9.6      Successor Agent.

                  The Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to
the Lenders and the Credit Parties and may be removed at any time with or
without cause by the Required Lenders; provided that the Agent shall not resign
until a successor Agent has been appointed. Upon any such resignation or
removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower. If no successor Agent shall have been
so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the
retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which
shall be a commercial Lender organized under the laws of the United States of
America having combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any
retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this Section 9 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.


                                   SECTION 10

         10.2     Right of Set-Off; Adjustments.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender (and each of its Affiliates) is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off
and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such
Lender (or any of its Affiliates) to or for the credit or the account of any
Credit Party against any and all of the obligations of such Person now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement, under the Notes, under any other Credit
Document or otherwise, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any
demand hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may be unmatured.
Each Lender agrees promptly


<PAGE>   97
                                      -92-


to notify any affected Credit Party after any such set-off and application made
by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each
Lender under this Section 10.2 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender may
have.

         10.3     Benefit of Agreement.

                  (a)      This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the
parties hereto; provided that none of the Credit Parties may assign or transfer
any of its interests and obligations without prior written consent of the
Lenders; provided further that the rights of each Lender to transfer, assign or
grant participations in its rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be limited
as set forth in this Section 10.3.

                  (b)      Each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, all or a portion of its portion of the Loan and
its Notes) without prior written consent of the Lenders or Agent; provided,
however, that

                            (i)     except in the case of an assignment to
                  another Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights
                  and obligations under this Agreement, any such partial
                  assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to $1,000,000
                  or an integral multiple of $250,000 in excess thereof;

                           (ii)     each such assignment by a Lender shall be of
                  a constant, and not varying, percentage of all of its rights
                  and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes; and

                          (iii)     the parties to such assignment shall execute
                  and deliver to the Agent for its acceptance an Assignment and
                  Acceptance in the form of Exhibit 10.3(b) hereto, together
                  with any Note subject to such assignment and a processing fee
                  of $2,500 (or if the Assignee is a Lender, $1,500).

Upon execution, delivery, and acceptance of such Assignment and Acceptance, the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of such
assignment, have the obligations, rights, and benefits of a Lender hereunder and
the assigning


<PAGE>   98
                                      -93-


Lender shall, to the extent of such assignment, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement. Upon the consummation of any
assignment pursuant to this Section 10.3(b), the assignor, the Agent and the
Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, new Notes are
issued to the assignor and the assignee. If the assignee is not a United States
person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, it shall deliver to the Borrower
and the Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of
Taxes.

                  (c)      The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to
in Section 10.1 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders and the principal amount of the Loans owing to each Lender from time
to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Credit Parties, the
Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register
shall be available for inspection by the Credit Parties or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. No
assignment shall be effective unless it has been recorded on the Register as
provided herein.

                  (d)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by the parties thereto, together with any Note subject to such
assignment and payment of the processing fee, the Agent shall, if such
Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit 10.3(b) hereto, within five (5) Business Days of its receipt thereof (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the parties
thereto.

                  (e)      Each Lender may sell participations to one or more
Persons in all or a portion of its rights, obligations or rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Loans); provided,
however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the participant shall be
entitled to the benefit of the yield protection provisions contained in Sections
3.3 and 3.4 and the right of set-off contained in Section 10.2, and (iv) the
Credit Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and
such Lender shall retain




<PAGE>   99
                                      -94-


the sole right to enforce the obligations of the Credit Parties relating to the
Credit Party Obligations owing to such Lender and to approve any amendment,
modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other than
amendments, modifications, or waivers decreasing the amount of principal of or
the rate at which interest is payable on such Loans or Notes, extending any
scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the payment of interest on
such Loans or Notes reducing the principal amount of any Credit Party
Obligations or any fees owed to the Lenders hereunder).

                  (f)      Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender may at any time assign and pledge all or any portion of
its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Lender as collateral security
pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal
Reserve Lender. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its
obligations hereunder.

                  (g)      Any Lender may furnish any information concerning the
Consolidated Parties in the possession of such Lender from time to time to
assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants),
subject, however, to the provisions of Section 10.14 hereof.

         10.4     No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.

                  No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit
Document and no course of dealing between the Agent or any Lender and any of the
Credit Parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and
remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which the Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or
demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle the Credit Parties to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or
constitute a waiver of the rights of the Agent or the Lenders to any other or
further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.


<PAGE>   100
                                      -95-


         10.5     Expenses; Indemnification.

                  (a)      The Borrower agrees to pay on demand all costs and
expenses of the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the syndication,
preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, and
amendment of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents, and the other documents
to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel for the Agent (including the cost of internal counsel),
Cahill Gordon & Reindel and Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP with respect
thereto. The Borrower further agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses of
the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses and the cost of internal counsel), in connection
with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or
otherwise) of the Credit Documents and the other documents to be delivered
hereunder.

                  (b)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Agent and each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, and advisors (each, an "Indemnified
Party") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities,
costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees)
that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in
each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including,
without limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation, or
proceeding or preparation of defense in connection therewith) the Credit
Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed
use of the proceeds of the Loans, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss,
liability, cost, or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation,
litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 10.5
applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation,
litigation or proceeding is brought by any of the Credit Parties, their
respective directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any
other Person or any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether
or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Borrower agrees
not to assert any claim against the Agent, any Lender, any of their Affiliates,
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents,
and advisers, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential,
or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the Credit
Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed
use of the proceeds of the Loans.

                  (c)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Borrower contained in this Section 10.5 shall survive the repayment of the Term
Loan and other obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination of the
Commitments hereunder.

         10.6     Amendments, Waivers and Consents.

                  Neither this Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor any
of the terms hereof or thereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or
terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination is in
writing entered into by, or approved in writing by, the Required Lenders and the

thereby, neither this Agreement nor any other Credit Document may be amended to

                  (a)      extend the final maturity of the Loan,

                  (b)      reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of

         post-default increase in interest rates) thereon or Fees hereunder,

                  (c)      reduce or waive the principal amount of any Loan or

                  (d)      release all or substantially all of the Collateral,

                  (e)      except as the result of or in connection with a
         dissolution, merger or disposition of a Consolidated Party permitted
         under Section 7.4, release the Borrower or substantially all of the
         other Credit Parties from its or their obligations under the Credit
         Documents,

                  (f)      amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section

                  (i)      without the consent of the Agent, no provision of
         Section 9 may be amended.

Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is required in
certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is entitled to vote as
such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan that affects the
Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of Section 1126(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code supersede the unanimous consent provisions set forth herein
and (y) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a Credit Party to use cash
collateral in the context of a Bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

         10.7     Counterparts.

                  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary in
making proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than one such
counterpart for each of the parties hereto. Delivery by facsimile by any of the
parties hereto of an executed counterpart of this Agreement shall be as
effective as an original executed counterpart hereof and shall be deemed a
representation that an original executed counterpart hereof will be delivered.

         10.8     Headings.

                  The headings of the sections and subsections hereof are
provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
construction of any provision of this Agreement.

         10.9     Survival.

                  All indemnities set forth herein shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the making of the Loans, the repayment of the
Loans and other obligations under the Credit Documents, and all representations
and warranties made by the Borrower herein shall survive delivery of the Notes
and the making of the Loans hereunder.

         10.10    Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue.

THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER
<PAGE>   103
                                      -98-

SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or any other Credit Document may be brought in the courts of the State
of New York, or of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and,
by execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Borrower hereby irrevocably
accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts. The Borrower
further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Borrower at the
address set out for notices pursuant to Section 10.1, such service to become
effective three (3) days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the
right of the Agent or any Lender to serve process in any other manner permitted
by law or to commence legal proceedings or to otherwise proceed against any
Credit Party in any other jurisdiction.

                  (b)      The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid
actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Credit Document brought in the courts referred to in subsection (a)
above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in
any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

                  (c)      TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF THE AGENT,
THE LENDERS, THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
CREDIT AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         10.11    Severability.

                  If any provision of any of the Credit Documents is determined
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable
and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be
construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions.
<PAGE>   104
                                      -99-

         10.12    Entirety.

                  This Agreement together with the other Credit Documents
represent the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any, including any
commitment letters or correspondence relating to the Credit Documents or the
transactions contemplated herein and therein.

         10.13    Binding Effect; Termination.

                  (a)      This Agreement shall become effective at such time on
or after the Closing Date when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and
the Agent, and the Agent shall have received copies hereof (telefaxed or
otherwise) which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each Lender, and
thereafter this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower, each Credit Party, the Agent and each Lender and their respective
successors and assigns.

                  (b)      The term of this Agreement shall be until no Loans or
any other amounts payable hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents
shall remain outstanding and all of the Credit Party Obligations have been
irrevocably satisfied in full.

         10.14    Confidentiality.

                  The Agent and each Lender (each, a "Lending Party") agrees to
keep confidential any information furnished or made available to it by the
Credit Parties pursuant to this Agreement that is marked confidential; provided
that nothing herein shall prevent any Lending Party from disclosing such
information (a) to any other Lending Party or any Affiliate of any Lending
Party, or any officer, director, employee, agent, or advisor of any Lending
Party or Affiliate of any Lending Party, (b) to any other Person if reasonably
incidental to the administration of the credit facility provided herein, (c) as
required by any law, rule, or regulation, (d) upon the order of any court or
administrative agency, (e) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency
or authority, (f) that is or becomes available to the public or that is or
becomes available to any Lending Party other than as a result of a disclosure by
any Lending Party prohibited by this Agreement, (g) in connection with any
litigation to which such Lending Party or any of its Affiliates may be a party,
(h) to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise of any remedy under
this Agreement or any other Credit Document and (i) subject to provisions
substantially similar to those contained in this Section 10.14, to any actual or
proposed participant or assignee.

                                     -100-

         10.15    Conflict.

                  To the extent that there is a conflict or inconsistency
between any provision hereof, on the one hand, and any provision of any other
Credit Document, on the other hand, this Agreement shall control.

         10.16    Payment Under Intercreditor Agreement.

                  If the Lenders or the Agent turn over any payments in
accordance with Section 2.13 of the Intercreditor Agreement, no such payment
will be deemed to have been made to the Lenders or the Agent under this
Agreement.

         10.17    Ratable Sharing.

                  The Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of them
shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of the
Loan made and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or an
assignment pursuant to Section 10.3), by realization upon any funds, through the
exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross
action or by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents or
otherwise, receive an amount on account of the Credit Party Obligations
(collectively, the "Aggregate Amounts Due" to such Lender) the proportion of
which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of
the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify the Lenders of the receipt of
such payment and (ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase assignments
(which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of an assignment
simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment)
of the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of
Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the
Aggregate Amount Due to them; provided that if all or part of such
proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any of the
Credit Parties or otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase
prices paid for such assignments shall be returned to such purchasing Lender
ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Credit Parties
expressly consent to the foregoing arrangement and agree that any purchaser of
an assignment so purchased
<PAGE>   106

                                     -101-


may exercise any and all rights of a Lender as to such assignment as fully as if
that Lender had complied with the provisions of subsection 10.3(b) with respect
to such assignment. In order to further evidence such assignment (and without
prejudice to the effectiveness of the assignment provisions set forth above),
each purchasing Lender and each selling Lender agree to enter into an Assignment
and Acceptance Agreement at the request of a selling Lender or a purchasing
Lender, as the case may be, substantially similar in form and substance to the
form contained in Exhibit 10.3(b).

at a specified bank account, but in no event shall the interest rate hereunder
be less than 15% per annum. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuation of
an Event of Default, the unpaid principal amount of the Loan shall bear interest
at a rate 3% greater than the rate in effect as specified above. In the event of
acceleration of the Loan pursuant to Section 8, the Borrower will prepay all
Loans at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus a
make-whole premium equal to the remaining cash interest payments (calculated on
the basis of the Prime Rate in effect on the date of such acceleration) that
would have been paid, discounted at the yield prevailing for U.S. Treasury
obligations maturing closest to the Maturity Date, plus 50 basis points.

                  The Lender is authorized to endorse the amount and the date on
which the Loan is made and each payment of principal with respect thereto on the
schedule annexed hereto and made a part hereof, or on continuations thereof
which shall be attached hereto and made a part hereof; provided, however, that
any failure to endorse such information on such schedule or

continuation thereof shall not in any manner affect any obligation of Borrower
under the Credit Agreement and this promissory note (this "Note"). Any
assignment of the Loan evidenced by this Note shall be effective only upon
appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register.

                  This Note is one of the Notes referred to in, and is entitled
to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement, which Credit Agreement, among other
things, contains provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the
happening of certain stated events and also for prepayments on account of
principal hereof prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions
therein specified.

                            FORM OF JOINDER AGREEMENT


                  THIS JOINDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of this
____ day of June by and between [Name of subsidiary], a corporation organized
and existing under the laws of _______________ (the "Subsidiary"), and Bankers
Trust Company, in its capacity as agent (the "Agent") under that certain
Collateral Security Agreement (as it may be amended, modified, extended or
restated from time to time, the "Collateral Security Agreement"), dated as of
June ___, 2001, by and among WestPoint Stevens Inc. (the "Borrower"), each of
the subsidiaries of the Borrower listed on the signature pages thereto and the
Agent for and on behalf of the Lenders. All of the defined terms in the
Collateral Security Agreement are incorporated herein by reference.

                  The Subsidiary is an Additional Grantor, and, consequently,
the Borrower is required by Section 2.2 of the Collateral Security Agreement to
cause the Subsidiary to become a party to the Collateral Security Agreement as a
Grantor, to guaranty the Secured Debt on terms substantially similar to those
set forth in the Guaranties, and by becoming a party to the Collateral Security
Agreement as a Grantor, grant to the Agent for itself and for the benefit of the
Secured Parties a continuing security interest in all Grantor Collateral which
it now owns or hereafter acquires.

                  Accordingly, the Subsidiary hereby agrees as follows with the
Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties:

                  1. The Subsidiary hereby acknowledges, agrees and confirms
that, by its execution of this Agreement, the Subsidiary will be deemed to be a
party to the Collateral Security Agreement and a "Grantor" for all purposes of
the Collateral Security Agreement, and shall have all of the obligations of a
Grantor thereunder as if it had executed the Collateral Security Agreement. The
Subsidiary hereby ratifies, as of the date hereof, and agrees to be bound by,
all of the terms, provisions and conditions contained in the Collateral Security
Agreement, including without limitation (i) all of the representations and
warranties of the Grantors set forth therein, (ii) all of the affirmative and
negative covenants set forth therein and (iii) all of the other undertakings and
waivers by Grantors set forth therein.

                                      -2-

                  2. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing section 1,
as collateral security for the prompt and complete payment and performance when
due of all of the Secured Debt, the Subsidiary does hereby pledge, assign and
transfer unto the Agent for itself and for the ratable benefit of the Secured
Parties, and does hereby grant to the Agent for itself and the ratable benefit
of the Secured Parties, a continuing security interest, in all of the right,
title and interest of the Subsidiary in the Grantor Collateral, subject as to
priority only to Liens permitted by the Credit Agreement which, pursuant to
applicable law, are prior in right to the Lien granted hereby. The Subsidiary
has executed contemporaneously herewith a Subsidiary Guaranty in favor of the
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders.

                  3.  The Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants to the Agent
         that:

                   (i) The Subsidiary's chief executive office, jurisdiction of
         incorporation (together with any organizational number designated by
         the applicable jurisdiction, if any) and chief place of business are
         (and for the prior four months have been) located at the locations set
         forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto and the Subsidiary keeps its books
         and records at such locations.

                  (ii) The type of Collateral owned by the Subsidiary and the
         location of all Collateral owned by the Subsidiary is as shown on
         Schedule 2 attached hereto.

                 (iii) The Subsidiary's legal name is as shown in this Agreement
         and the Subsidiary has not in the past four months changed its name,
         been party to a merger, consolidation or other change in structure or
         used any tradename except as set forth in Schedule 3 attached hereto.

                  (iv) The patents and trademarks listed on Schedule 4 attached
         hereto constitute all of the registrations and applications for the
         patents and trademarks owned by the Subsidiary.

                  4. The Subsidiary hereby acknowledges, agrees and confirms
that, by its execution of this Agreement, the Subsidiary will be deemed to be a
party to the Stock Pledge Agreement executed by the Borrower, and shall have all
the obligations of a "Pledgor" thereunder as if it had executed the Stock Pledge
Agreement. The Subsidiary hereby ratifies, as of the date


<PAGE>   119


                                      -3-

hereof, and agrees to be bound by, all the terms, provisions and conditions
contained in the Stock Pledge Agreement.

                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing terms of this
paragraph 4, the Subsidiary hereby pledges and assigns to the Agent, for the
benefit of the Lenders, and grants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders,
a continuing security interest in any and all right, title and interest of the
Subsidiary in and to Pledged Shares (as such term is defined in Section 1(a) of
the Stock Pledge Agreement) listed on Schedule 5 attached hereto.

                  5.  The address of the Subsidiary for purposes of all notices
and other communications is ____________________, ____________________________,
Attention of ______________ (Facsimile No. ____________).

                  6. The Subsidiary hereby waives acceptance by the Agent and
the Lenders of the guaranty by the Subsidiary upon the execution of this
Agreement by the Subsidiary.

                  7. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together
shall constitute one contract.

                  8.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

Agreement to be duly executed by its authorized officers, and the Agent, for the

                  The "Assignor" and the "Assignee" referred to on Schedule 1
agree as follows:

                  1. The Assignor hereby sells and assigns to the Assignee,
without recourse and without representation or warranty except as expressly set

(ii) agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the
Assignor or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under the Credit Agreement; (iii) confirms that it
is an Eligible Assignee; (iv) appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
the Credit Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms thereof,
together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto;
and (v) agrees that it will perform in accordance with its terms all of the

Effective Date, (i) the Assignee shall be a party to the Credit Agreement and,

obligations of a Lender thereunder and (ii) the Assignor shall, to the extent

after the Effective Date, the Agent shall make all payments under the Credit
Agreement and the Notes in respect of the interest assigned hereby (including,
without limitation, all payments of principal, interest and commitment fees with
respect thereto) to the Assignee. The Assignor and Assignee shall make all
