applicable borrowing date or such other date on which it becomes a Eurodollar
Rate Loan (as applicable) to but not including the date on which another
interest rate becomes applicable to it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the Highest Lawful Rate and

thereof from the date on which Administrative Agent determines or is notified
that the provisions of Sections&nbsp;4.2 or 4.3 apply to and including the date on
which Administrative Agent notifies Borrower that the provisions of Sections
4.2 and 4.3 no longer apply at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the

obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for its portion of any Loan in any

it has obtained or will obtain the funds for its portion of any Loan in any
particular place or manner.

without any action by any Lender or Administrative Agent, the Obligations shall

demand, the Termination Date or the applicable Term Loan Maturity Date and
shall accrue until the earlier of (a)&nbsp;waiver or cure (to the satisfaction of

each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein)

expenses incurred on behalf of Lenders or L/C Issuer under the Loan Documents
then due and payable, if any; (ii)&nbsp;to the payment of all other fees under the
Loan Documents then due and payable; (iii)&nbsp;to the payment of interest then due

hereunder, that Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such
payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower or such Lender, as the
case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required
to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person
entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made
to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:

forthwith on demand repay to Administrative Agent the portion of such
assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately
available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day
from and including the date such amount was made available by
Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to

immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the
period from the date such amount was made available by Administrative
Agent to Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by Administrative
Agent (the &#147;<I>Compensation Period</I>&#148;) at a rate per annum equal to the

Borrower shall pay such amount to Administrative Agent, together with

each Revolving Loan and Term Loan are several and not joint. The failure of
any Lender to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan or Term Loan shall
not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such
date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to
fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan or Term Loan .


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.11 <I>Sharing of Payments</I>. Any Lender obtaining a payment (whether
voluntary or involuntary, due to the exercise of any right of set-off, or
otherwise) on account of any in excess of its Pro Rata Share, as applicable, of
all payments made by Borrower with respect to such Loan shall purchase from
each other Lender such participation in such Loan as shall be necessary to
cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment pro rata according to
the respective Pro Rata Shares, with each other Lender; provided, however, that
if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Borrower agrees
that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to
this Section&nbsp;2.11, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, may exercise all of
its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

of Credit Application, L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each,

of Credit must permit L/C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in
each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter
of Credit and in no event later than seven Business Days prior to the expiry
date of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary

issued, Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) L/C
Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry
date not later than the date specified in Section&nbsp;3.1(b)(ii); provided,

Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer pursuant to this Section

Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and

Borrower to or for the account of Administrative Agent, any Lender or L/C
Issuer under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future income, stamp or other Taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar
charges, now or hereafter imposed, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding, in the case of Administrative Agent, any Lender, L/C Issuer, or its
Principal Office, applicable lending office, or any branch or Affiliate
thereof, Taxes imposed on or measured by its net income (including net income
Taxes imposed by means of a backup withholding tax) franchise Taxes, branch
Taxes, Taxes on doing business or Taxes measured by or imposed upon the overall
capital or net worth of Administrative Agent, such Lender, or L/C Issuer or its
Principal Office, applicable lending office, or any branch or Affiliate
thereof, in each case imposed: (i)&nbsp;by the jurisdiction under the Laws of
which Administrative Agent, such Lender, or L/C Issuer or its Principal Office,
applicable lending office, branch or Affiliate is organized or is located, or
in which the principal executive office of Administrative Agent, such Lender,
or L/C Issuer is located, or any nation within which such jurisdiction is
located or any political subdivision thereof, or (ii)&nbsp;by reason of any present
or former connection between the jurisdiction imposing such Tax and
Administrative Agent, such Lender, or L/C Issuer or its applicable lending
office, branch or Affiliate other than a connection arising solely from
Administrative Agent, such Lender, or L/C Issuer having executed, delivered or
performed its obligation under, or received payment under or enforced this
Agreement the Laws of such jurisdiction (all such Taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as &#147;<I>Indemnified Taxes</I>&#148;). If Borrower
shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to Administrative Agent, any
Lender, or L/C Issuer, (i)&nbsp;the sum payable shall be increased as necessary to
yield to Administrative Agent, such Lender, or L/C Issuer an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)&nbsp;Borrower
shall make such deductions, (iii)&nbsp;Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other Governmental Authority in
accordance with Applicable Laws, and (iv)&nbsp;promptly (but in no event later than
thirty days) after the date of such payment, Borrower shall furnish to
Administrative Agent (which shall forward the same to such Lender or L/C
Issuer) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof.

to which Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it
shall pay to Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of

Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of Administrative Agent, such

interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such

Lender or L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to Borrower (plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to Administrative Agent, such Lender or L/C Issuer in the event
Administrative Agent, such Lender or L/C Issuer is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to
require Administrative Agent, any Lender or L/C Issuer to make available its
tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems
confidential) to Borrower or any other Person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2 <I>Illegality</I>. If any Lender determines that any change in Law on or
after the Agreement Date has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental
Authority on or after the Agreement Date has asserted that it is unlawful, for
any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund
Eurodollar Rate Loans, or materially restricts the authority of such Lender to
purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable offshore
Dollar market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Basis, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Administrative
Agent (who shall notify Borrower thereof), any obligation of such Lender to
make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until each Lender
notifies Administrative Agent (who shall notify Borrower thereof) that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon the date
of such notice, all Eurodollar Rate Loans of all Lenders shall convert to Prime
Rate Loans. Each Lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such
designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith
judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such
Lender.

deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore Dollar
market for the applicable amount and applicable term, or (ii)&nbsp;adequate and

such increased cost or reduction.

Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof on or after the Agreement Date, or compliance by such Lender (or its
lending office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with respect
to this Agreement as a consequence of such Lender&#146;s obligations hereunder
(taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and
such Lender&#146;s desired return on capital), then from time to time within five
Business Days after demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to

amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.

funds or deposits (currently known as &#147;<I>Eurocurrency liabilities</I>&#148;), additional
costs on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the
actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as
determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall constitute
<I>prima facie </I>evidence as to the facts thereof), which shall be due and payable
on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided Borrower shall
have received at least fifteen days&#146; prior notice (with a copy of such notice
to Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If such
Lender fails to give notice fifteen days prior to the relevant Payment Date,
such additional interest shall be due and payable fifteen days from receipt of
such notice.

internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its applicable lending office, if the making of such a change

power, authority and legal right, to execute, deliver and comply with the terms
of the Loan Documents to be executed by it, all of which have been duly
authorized and approved by all necessary corporate, limited liability company
or limited partnership action and for which no approval or consent of any
Governmental Authority which has not been obtained is required. No proceeding
is pending for the forfeiture of any Borrower&#146;s or any such Subsidiary&#146;s
organization documents or its dissolution. The issued and outstanding capital
stock, limited liability company interest and partnership interest of Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries is duly authorized validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and free of the preemptive rights of shareholders. Schedule&nbsp;8.1
sets forth the respective jurisdiction of organization and percentage ownership
as of the Agreement Date of each of Borrower&#146;s direct and indirect
Subsidiaries. Borrower has no direct or indirect Subsidiary other than those

unfavorable commitments, any of which are material in amount in relation to the
financial condition of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except for Existing
Debt. The description of all Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries heretofore furnished to Administrative Agent, Lenders and L/C
Issuer is complete and correct in all material respects. Since the date of the

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">described in Sections&nbsp;5.1(k) or the Current Financials, there has been no
Material Adverse Change.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3 <I>Compliance With Laws and Other Matters</I>. The execution, delivery and
performance and compliance with the terms of the Loan Documents will not cause
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to be, (a)&nbsp;in violation of its corporate
charter or bylaws, certificate of organization, operating agreement,
certificate of limited partnership, partnership agreement or other organization
and governance document, (b)&nbsp;in violation of any Law in any respect which could
have any Material Adverse Effect, or (c)&nbsp;in default (nor has any event occurred
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, could constitute a default) under
any material agreement (including any agreement related to any Debt or such
Person).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.4 <I>Litigation</I>. There is no Litigation pending against or, to the
knowledge of Borrower, threatened against or affecting any Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective assets or properties which involves the
probability of any final judgment or liability which may result in a Material
Adverse Change. Schedule&nbsp;8.4 is a complete and correct description of all
Existing Litigation where the amount in controversy is equal to or greater than
$250,000. Borrower&#146;s good faith estimate of the aggregate amount of all claims
against Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Existing Litigation on the
Agreement Date is approximately $373,500. There are no outstanding or unpaid
final judgments against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5 <I>Debt</I>. Since the date of the latest of the Current Financials, neither
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any Debt except Permitted
Debt. Schedule&nbsp;8.5 is a complete and correct description of all Existing Debt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.6 <I>Vesta Obligations</I>. Except as described on Schedule&nbsp;8.6, neither
Borrower nor any Subsidiary of Borrower is liable for any obligations of Vesta

full corporate, limited liability or partnership, respectively, power,
authority and legal right to own and operate the properties which it now owns,
and to carry on the lines of business in which it is now engaged, and (b)&nbsp;good
and marketable title to its owned properties, subject to no Lien of any kind,
except Permitted Liens.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.8 <I>Authorization; Validity</I>. The Board of Directors, managers, partners
or other appropriate governance board of each Obligor has duly authorized the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents to which such Obligor is a party
and the performance of their respective terms. No consent of the stockholders,
members, partners or other equityholders of any Obligor is required as a
prerequisite to the validity and enforceability of any Loan Document. Each
Obligor has full corporate, limited liability or partnership, respectively,
power, authority and legal right to execute and deliver and to perform and
observe the provisions of all Loan Documents to which such Obligor is a party.
Each of the Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each
Obligor which is a party thereto, enforceable in accordance with its respective
terms, subject as to enforcement of remedies to any Debtor Relief Laws.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.9 <I>Taxes</I>. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all federal
and state and all other material income Tax returns which are required to be
filed by such Person and has paid all Taxes as shown on said returns, and all
Taxes due and payable without returns and all assessments received to the
extent that such Taxes or assessments have become due and payable. All Tax
liabilities of Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries are adequately provided
for on the books of such Person, including interest and penalties. No income
Tax liability of a material nature has been asserted by taxing authorities for
Taxes in excess of those already paid, except such Taxes being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.10 <I>Use of Proceeds</I>. No Obligor is engaged principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation&nbsp;U of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) and no part of the proceeds
of any Loan or Letter of Credit will be used to purchase or carry any margin
stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
any margin stock. None of the assets of any Obligor are margin stock. No
Obligor nor any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action
which might cause this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents to violate any
regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to
violate the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in each case as in effect now or
as the same may hereafter be in effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.11 <I>Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc</I>. Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries possesses all franchises, certificates, licenses, permits and
other authorizations from all Governmental Authorities, free from burdensome
restrictions, that (a)&nbsp;are necessary for the ownership, maintenance and
operation of its properties and assets, and (b)&nbsp;the loss of possession of which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and such Person
is not in violation of any thereof. Schedule&nbsp;8.11 lists with respect to each
RIC, as of the Agreement Date, all of the jurisdictions in which such RIC holds
licenses (including, without limitation, licenses or certificates of authority
from relevant Insurance Regulators), permits or authorizations to transact
Insurance Business, and indicates the line or lines of insurance in which each
such RIC is permitted to be engaged with respect to each license therein
listed. To the knowledge of Borrower, (a)&nbsp;no such license is the subject of a
proceeding for suspension, revocation or limitation or any similar proceedings,
(b)&nbsp;there is no sustainable basis for such a suspension, revocation or
limitation, and (c)&nbsp;no such suspension, revocation or limitation is threatened
by any relevant Insurance Regulator. No RIC transacts as of the Agreement Date
any Insurance Business, directly or indirectly, in any jurisdiction other than
those listed on Schedule&nbsp;8.11, where such business requires any license, permit
or other authorization of an Insurance Regulator of such jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.12 <I>Leases</I>. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and
undisturbed possession of all leases necessary for the operation of its
properties and assets the loss of possession of which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All such leases are valid and
subsisting and are in full force and effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.13 <I>Disclosure</I>. Neither this Agreement nor any other document,

Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or

Article&nbsp;IX; provided, however, that unless and until Administrative Agent has
received any such direction, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be

respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in
the best interest of Lenders and L/C Issuer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.6 <I>Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Administrative Agent</I>.
Each Lender and L/C Issuer acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made
any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of any Obligor or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed
to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any
Lender and L/C Issuer as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons
have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender and L/C
Issuer represents to Administrative Agent that it has, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and
other condition and creditworthiness of any Obligor and its Subsidiaries, and
all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to Borrower hereunder. Each Lender and L/C Issuer also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrower. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to
Lenders and L/C Issuer by Administrative Agent herein, Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or L/C Issuer
with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any
Obligor or any of its Affiliates which may come into the possession of any
Agent-Related Person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.7 <I>Indemnification of Administrative Agent</I>. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Lenders shall indemnify upon
demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf
of any Obligor and without limiting the obligation of any Obligor to do so),
based on their Pro Rata Share, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from
and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided,
however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related
Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined
in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from such Agent-Related Person&#146;s own gross negligence or willful
misconduct; provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the
directions of Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence
or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Administrative Agent upon demand for its
ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs)
incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in

kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with
each Obligor and its respective Affiliates as though Frost were not
Administrative Agent and without notice to or consent of Lenders or L/C Issuer.
Lenders and L/C Issuer acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Frost or
its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Obligor or its Affiliates
(including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in
favor of such Obligor or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that Administrative
Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With
respect to its interest in the Loans and Letters of Credit, Frost shall have
the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise such rights and powers as though it were not Administrative Agent, and

Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, Required Lenders shall
appoint from among Lenders a successor administrative agent for Lenders and L/C
Issuer, which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by Borrower
at all times other than during the existence of a Default (which consent of
Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor
administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the
resignation of Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent may appoint, after
consulting with Lenders, L/C Issuer and Borrower, a successor administrative
agent from among Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor
administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor
administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent and the term &#147;Administrative Agent&#148; shall mean
such successor administrative agent. After any retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s
resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article&nbsp;X
and Sections&nbsp;6.7 and 11.2 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as
Administrative Agent by the date which is 30&nbsp;days following a retiring
Administrative Agent&#146;s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent&#146;s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the
Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Administrative Agent hereunder until
such time, if any, as Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided
for above (except that in the case of any collateral security held by
Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders or L/C Issuer under any of the Loan
Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such
collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is
appointed).

Borrower relating to Borrower, any other Obligor or any Subsidiary of Borrower
or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is
available to Administrative Agent, any Lender or L/C Issuer on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower, any other Obligor or any
Subsidiary of Borrower, provided that, in the case of information received from
a Borrower, any other Obligor or any Subsidiary of Borrower after the date
hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as
confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.

counterparts, including via facsimile, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all such separate counterparts shall together constitute but one
and the same instrument.

reason prohibited or found or held invalid or unenforceable by any Governmental
Authority shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity
or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof in
such jurisdiction or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.11 <I>Interest and Charges</I>. It is not the intention of any parties to
this Agreement to make an agreement in violation of the Laws of any applicable
jurisdiction relating to usury. Regardless of any provision in any Loan
Document, neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender nor L/C Issuer shall ever
be entitled to receive, collect or apply, as interest on the Obligations, any
amount in excess of the Maximum Amount. If Administrative Agent, any Lender,
L/C Issuer or any Participant ever receives, collects or applies, as interest,
any such excess, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be deemed
a partial repayment of principal by Borrower. In determining whether or not
the interest paid or payable, under any specific contingency, exceeds the
Maximum Amount, Borrower and Administrative Agent, Lenders and L/C Issuer
shall, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, (a)&nbsp;characterize
any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest,
(b)&nbsp;exclude voluntary prepayments and the effect thereof, and (c)&nbsp;amortize,
prorate, allocate and spread in equal parts, the total amount of interest
throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligations so that the interest
rate is uniform throughout the entire term of the Obligations; provided,
however, that if the Obligations are paid and performed in full prior to the
end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the
actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Maximum Amount, Administrative
Agent, Lenders and L/C Issuer shall refund to Borrower the amount of such
excess or credit the amount of such excess against the total principal amount
of the Obligations owing, and, in such event, neither Administrative Agent nor
any Lender nor L/C Issuer shall be subject to any penalties provided by any
Laws for contracting for, charging or receiving interest in excess of the
Maximum Amount. This Section shall control every other provision of all
agreements pertaining to the transactions contemplated by or contained in the
Loan Documents.

consents required by, Section&nbsp;11.6), all of its interests, rights and

that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a
Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
