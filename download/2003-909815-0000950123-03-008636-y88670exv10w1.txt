to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to
such Lender from time to time hereunder.

         (ii)  The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record
(a) the amount of each Loan made  hereunder,  the Type  thereof and the Interest
Period with respect thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender  hereunder
and (c) the amount of any sum received by the Agent  hereunder from the Borrower
and each Lender's share thereof.

         (iii) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure
of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall
not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations
in accordance with their terms.

         (iv)  Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a Note. In
such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a
Note payable to the order of such Lender in a form supplied by the Agent.
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all
times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented
by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein or any
assignee pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent that any such Lender or
assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that
such Loans once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (i) and (ii)
above.

         2.14.    Telephonic Notices. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders
and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of
Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any
person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on
behalf of the Borrower. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a
written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any
Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the
written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by
the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern
absent manifest error.

         2.15.    Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest
accrued on each ABR Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which
the ABR Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and at
maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount
of any ABR Advance converted into a Eurodollar Advance on a day other than a
Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on
each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable
Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether
by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each
Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also
be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest
Period. Interest on Eurodollar Advances and Facility Fees shall be calculated
for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year, and interest on ABR
Advances shall be calculated for the actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365
or 366 day year, as applicable. Interest shall be payable for the day

                                      - 14 -

<PAGE>

an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if
payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any
payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day
which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time
shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.

         2.16.    Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and
Commitment Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify
each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice,
Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received
by it hereunder. The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate
applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such
interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the
Alternate Base Rate.

         2.17.    Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be
deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of such Lending Installation. Each
Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrower in accordance with
Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through
which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be
made.

         2.18.    Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Borrower or a
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been
made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If
such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such
payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the
Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and,
thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case
of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

                             YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

         3.1.     Yield Protection. (a) If, on or after the date of this
Agreement, the adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental
rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the
force of law), or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental or quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Lender or applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency:

     (i)          subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to
                  any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other
                  than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect
                  of its Eurodollar Loans, or

     (ii)         imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
                  assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar
                  requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
                  account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any
                  applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and
                  assessments taken into account in determining the interest
                  rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

     (iii)        imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
                  the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
                  of making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or
                  reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable
                  Lending Installation in connection with its Eurodollar Loans,
                  or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
                  to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of
                  Eurodollar Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount
                  deemed material by such Lender,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or
Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending
Installation in connection with such Eurodollar Loans or Commitment, then,
within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduction in amount received; provided, however, that if any such Lender
fails to deliver such demand within 180 days after the date on which an officer
of such Lender has actual knowledge of its right to compensation under this
Section 3.1, then such Lender shall only be entitled to additional compensation
for any such increases required from and after the date that is 180 days prior
to the date such Lender delivers such demand.

     (b)          Non-U.S. Reserve Costs With Respect to Loans to Non-U.S.
Borrowers. If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive of any jurisdiction outside of the
United States of America or any subdivision thereof (whether or not having the
force of law), imposes or deems applicable any reserve requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any
Lender or any applicable Lending Installation, and the result of the foregoing
is to increase the cost to such Lender or applicable Lending Installation of
making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans to any Borrower that is not
incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof
(each a "Non-U.S. Borrower") or its Commitment to any Non-U.S. Borrower or to
reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending Installation in
connection with such Eurodollar Loans to any Non-U.S. Borrower or Commitment to
any Non-U.S. Borrower, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, such
Non-U.S. Borrower shall pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount
received, provided that such Non-U.S. Borrower shall not be required to
compensate any Lender for such non-U.S. reserve costs to the extent that an
amount equal to such reserve costs is received by such Lender as a result of the
calculation of the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances pursuant to
clause (i)(b) of the definition of "Eurodollar Rate."

         3.2.     Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender
determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling
such Lender is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand
by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to
compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such
increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this
Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking
into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy); provided, however,
that if any such Lender fails to deliver such demand within 180 days after the
date on which an officer of such Lender has actual knowledge of its right to
compensation under this Section 3.2, then such Lender shall only be entitled to
additional compensation for any such increases in capital required from and
after the date that is 180 days prior to the date such Lender delivers such
demand. "Change" means (i) any change after the date of this Agreement in the
Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other
law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline,
interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the
date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected
to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation
controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based
capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement,
including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basel Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory
Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and
Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

         3.3.     Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines
that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation
would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, then the Agent shall suspend the availability of the
affected Type of Advance and require any affected Eurodollar Advances to be
repaid or converted to ABR Advances, subject to the payment of any funding
indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4. If the Required Lenders
determine that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund
Eurodollar Advances are not available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to a
Type of Advance does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining
such Advance, then the Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type
of Advance for any Advance made subsequent to the date of such suspension,
subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by
Section 3.4.

         3.4.     Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar
Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest
Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a
Eurodollar Advance is not made, converted or continued on the date specified by
the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will
indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom,
including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing
deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Eurodollar Advance.

         3.5.     Taxes. (i) All payments by the Borrower to or for the account
of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and
clear of and without deduction for

                                      - 17 -

<PAGE>

any and all Taxes. If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes
from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (a)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 3.5) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (b) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (c) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable
law and (d) the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent the original copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.

         (ii)     In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes,
charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under
any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to,
this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes").

         (iii)    The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and each
Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this
Section 3.5) paid by the Agent or such Lender and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.
Payments due under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date
the Agent or such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

         (iv)     Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender") agrees
that it will, not more than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
(i) deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of
United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, W-8BEN, W-8ECI, or W-8IMY
(including all required attachments thereto), as applicable, and (ii) such forms
shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes (including any backup withholding tax). Each Non-U.S. Lender further
undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent (x) renewals or
additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date
that such form expires or becomes obsolete as may be reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Agent, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or
amendments thereto reflecting such change. All forms or amendments described in
the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any
change in treaty, law or regulation or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority) has occurred prior to the
date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all
such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing
and delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender
advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments
without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

         (v)      For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv), above
(unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any

                                      - 18 -

<PAGE>

Governmental Authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form
originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be
entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed
by the United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise
exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to
Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv),
above, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall
reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.

         (vi)     Any Non-U.S. Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or
any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall
deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times
prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation
prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate.

         (vii)    If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental
authority of the United States or any other country or any political subdivision
thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly withhold tax from
amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form
was not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify
the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from
withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify
the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent as
tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and
including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Agent
under this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related thereto
(including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, which
attorneys may be employees of the Agent). The obligations of the Lenders under
this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the Obligations and
termination of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 3.5(vii) is intended to,
nor shall it, preclude the Borrower from pursuing any rights or remedies as it
may have against any Lender.

         3.6.     Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent
reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending
Installation with respect to its Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower
to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in
the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such
written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon
which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Determination of
amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall
be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the
purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used
as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan,
whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the
amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on
demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The obligations
of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of
the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         3.7.     Right to Substitute Lender. Any Lender claiming any additional
amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2 or unable to make a Type of
Advance available in accordance with Section 3.3, shall, so long as no Default
or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the written request of
the Borrower delivered to such Lender and the Agent, assign, pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of Section 12.3, all of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and under the Loan Documents to another Lender
or to a commercial bank, other financial institution, commercial finance company
or other business lender selected by the Borrower and reasonably acceptable to
the Agent that has agreed not to claim any additional amounts under Section 3.1
or 3.2 with respect to some or all of the taxes or regulatory changes that gave
rise to such assigning Lender's claim for such compensation, or that has agreed
to make the Type of Advance available that was not made available from such
assigning Lender, in consideration for the payment by such assignee to such
assigning Lender of the principal of, and interest accrued and unpaid to the
date of such assignment on, the Loans held by such assigning Lender, the payment
by the Borrower to such assigning Lender of any and all other amounts owing to
such assigning Lender under any provision of this Agreement accrued and unpaid
to the date of such assignment and the Borrower's release of such assigning
Lender from any further obligation or liability under this Agreement and the
Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 3.7, in no event shall the replacement of any Lender result in a
decrease or reallocation of the Aggregate Commitment without the prior written
consent of each of the remaining Lenders.

                  or warranty shall have been true and correct on and as of such
                  earlier date.

         Each Borrowing Notice with respect to each such Advance shall
constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the conditions
contained in Sections 4.2(i) and (ii) have been satisfied. Any Lender may
require a duly completed compliance certificate in substantially the form of
Exhibit B as a condition to making an Advance.

                                    ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

                                      - 21 -

<PAGE>

         5.1.     Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or
limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the
case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such
entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.

         5.2.     Authorization and Validity. The Borrower has the power and
authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to
perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Borrower
of the Loan Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have
been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings, and the Loan Documents
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable
against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

         5.3.     Compliance with Laws and Contracts. The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all applicable
statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective businesses or
the ownership of their respective properties, except where the failure to so
comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor
the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with
the provisions thereof will, or at the relevant time did, (i) violate any law,
rule, regulation (including Regulations T, U and X), order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's Charter Documents, (ii) violate the
provisions of or require the approval or consent of any indenture, instrument or
agreement to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is
subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or
constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary
pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement, or (iii)
require the consent or approval of any Person, except for any violation of, or
failure to obtain an approval or consent required under, any such indenture,
instrument or agreement that could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         5.4.     Governmental Consents. No order, consent, adjudication,
approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or
registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any
governmental or public body or authority, any subdivision thereof or any
securities exchange is or at the relevant time was necessary or required to
authorize, or is or at the relevant time was required in connection with the
execution, delivery, consummation or performance of, or the legality, validity,
binding effect or enforceability of, any of the Loan Documents, the application
of the proceeds of the Loans, or the consummation of any other transaction
contemplated by the Loan Documents. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is
in default under or in violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree or award binding upon or applicable to the Borrower
or such Subsidiary, in each case the consequences of which default or violation
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.5.     Financial Statements. The Borrower has heretofore furnished to
each of the Lenders (i) the December 31, 2002 audited consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiaries through
March 31, 2003 (collectively, the "Financial Statements"). Each of the Financial
Statements was prepared in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles, and
such Financial Statements fairly present the consolidated financial condition
and operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the Parent and its
subsidiaries at such dates and the consolidated results of their operations for
the respective periods then ended (except, in the case of such unaudited
statements, for normal year-end audit adjustments).

         5.6.     Material Adverse Change. No material adverse change in the
business, Property, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations
of the Borrower or of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, has
occurred since December 31, 2002.

         5.7.     Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed or caused
to be filed on a timely basis and in correct form all tax returns which are
required to be filed and have paid all taxes due and payable pursuant to said
returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith
and as to which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with
Agreement Accounting Principles and as to which no Lien exists. As of the date
hereof, there are no pending audits or investigations regarding the Borrower's
or its Subsidiary's tax returns. No tax liens have been filed and no claims are
being asserted with respect to any such taxes. The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any
taxes or other governmental charges are in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles or SAP, as applicable.

         5.8.     Litigation and Contingent Obligations. There is no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of
any Loans under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has any
material contingent obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial
statements referred to in Section 5.5 other than contingent obligations arising
under any policy of insurance or contract of reinsurance issued or entered into
in the ordinary course of business.

         5.9.     Capitalization. Schedule 5.9 contains an accurate list of all
Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth
their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their
respective capital stock or other ownership interests owned by the Borrower or
other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the extent such
concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership interests) duly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. No authorized but unissued or
treasury shares of the Borrower or any Subsidiary are subject to any option,
warrant, right to call or commitment of any kind or character, except (a) as set
forth on Schedule 5.9 and (b) in respect of the Borrower, as set forth in its
Charter Documents. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.9, neither the Borrower nor
any Subsidiary has any outstanding shares or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for any

                                      - 23 -

<PAGE>

shares, or any right issued to any Person to subscribe for or to purchase, or
any options for the purchase of, or any agreements providing for the issuance
(contingent or otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any
character relating to any of its shares or any shares or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for any of its shares other than as expressly set forth in
the Charter Documents of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. Neither the Borrower
nor any Subsidiary is subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to
repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire any shares or any convertible
securities, rights or options of the type described in the preceding sentence
except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 5.9.

         5.10.    Defaults. No Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is
continuing.

         5.11.    Federal Reserve Regulations. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is engaged, directly or indirectly, principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of extending, or arranging for the
extension of, credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.
Neither the making of any Advance hereunder nor the use of the proceeds thereof
will violate or result in a violation of the provisions of Regulation T,
Regulation U or Regulation X. Margin Stock constitutes less than 25% of the
value of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which are subject to
any limitation on sale, pledge, or other restriction hereunder.

         5.12.    Investment Company. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is, or after giving effect to any Advance will be, an "investment company" or a
company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

         5.13.    Certain Fees. No broker's or finder's fee or commission was,
is or will be payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary with respect to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Borrower hereby agrees to
indemnify the Agent and the Lenders against and agrees that it will hold each of
them harmless from any claim, demand or liability for any broker's or finder's
fees or commissions alleged to have been incurred by the Borrower in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys
for the Agent or any Lender, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent or
any Lender) arising in connection with any such claim, demand or liability.

         5.14.    Ownership of Properties. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.14,
on the date of this Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have good
title, free of all Liens other than those permitted by Section 6.16, to all of
the Property and assets reflected in the Borrower's most recent consolidated
financial statements provided to the Lenders as owned by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or possess rights to use all
licenses, patents, patent applications, copyrights, service marks, trademarks
and trade names necessary to continue to conduct their business as heretofore
conducted, and no such license, patent or trademark has been declared invalid,
been limited by order of any court or by agreement or is the subject of any
infringement, interference or similar proceeding or challenge, except for
proceedings and challenges which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>

         5.15.    Indebtedness. Attached hereto as Schedule 5.15 is a complete
and correct list of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
outstanding on the date of this Agreement (other than Indebtedness in a
principal amount not exceeding $3,000,000 for a single item of Indebtedness and
$15,000,000 in the aggregate for all such Indebtedness listed), showing the
aggregate principal amount which was outstanding on such date.

         5.16.    Material Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is a party to any agreement or instrument (other than insurance policies and
reinsurance agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business) or
subject to any charter or other corporate restriction which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect . Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of
the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in (i) any agreement to which
it is a party, which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing
Indebtedness.

         5.17.    Insurance. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries maintain with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies the insurance on their
Property in such amounts and covering such risks as are consistent with sound
business practice.

         5.18.    Insurance Licenses. Schedule 5.18 hereto lists all of the
jurisdictions in which the Borrower or any Insurance Subsidiary holds a License
and is authorized to transact insurance business as of the date of this
Agreement. No License held by the Borrower or any Insurance Subsidiary, the loss
of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, is the
subject of a proceeding for suspension or revocation. To the Borrower's
knowledge, there is not a sustainable basis for such suspension or revocation,
and no such suspension or revocation has been threatened by any Governmental
Authority. Schedule 5.18 also indicates the line or lines of insurance in which
each such Insurance Subsidiary is engaged and the jurisdictions in which such
Insurance Subsidiary is licensed to engage in any line of insurance, in each
case as of the date of this Agreement.

         5.19.    Filing. To ensure the enforceability or admissibility in
evidence of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in Bermuda, it is not
necessary that this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other document be
filed or recorded with any court (other than court filings relating to specific
litigation) or other authority in Bermuda or that any stamp or similar tax be
paid to or in respect of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. The
qualification by the Agent or any Lender for admission to do business under the
laws of Bermuda does not constitute a condition to, and the failure to so
qualify does not affect, the exercise (other than in or from Bermuda by a Person
not licensed under the Investment Business Act 1998 of Bermuda) by the Agent or
any Lender of any right, privilege, or remedy afforded to the Agent or any
Lender in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of any such right, privilege or remedy. The performance (other than
in or from Bermuda by a Person not licensed under the Investment Business Act
1998 of Bermuda) by the Agent or any Lender of any action required or permitted
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document will not violate any law or
regulation of Bermuda or any political subdivision thereof or result in any tax
liability or other unfavorable consequence to any such party pursuant to the
laws of Bermuda or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or any
rule or regulation of any federation or organization or similar entity of which
Bermuda is a member.

         5.20.    Disclosure. None of the (i) information, exhibits or reports
furnished or to be furnished by the Borrower or any Subsidiary to the Agent or
to any Lender in connection with the negotiation of the Loan Documents, or (ii)
representations or warranties of the Borrower or any Subsidiary contained in
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other document, certificate or
written statement furnished to the Agent or the Lenders by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary for use in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement contained, contains or will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted, omits or will omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances in which the same were made. There is
no fact known to the Borrower (other than matters of a general economic nature)
that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
and that has not been disclosed herein or in such other documents, certificates
and statements furnished to the Lenders for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    COVENANTS

                  the Borrower with a reinsurer having a financial strength
                  rating that is not at least comparable to the credit standing
                  of the Borrower.

                  or any Lender may from time to time reasonably request.

         6.2.     Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, use the proceeds of the Advances to meet the general corporate

stock" (as defined in Regulation U).

         6.3.     Notice of Default. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, give prompt notice in writing to the Lenders of (i) the

request for an extraordinary audit for cause by any Governmental Authority
which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, (v) any judicial or administrative order limiting or controlling
the business of the Borrower or any Subsidiary (and not the industry in which
the Borrower or such Subsidiary is engaged generally) which has been issued or
adopted which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or
(vi) the commencement of any litigation in which Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is named as a party and which could reasonably be expected to

necessary to remain duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing in
its jurisdiction of incorporation and its jurisdiction of domicile and maintain
all requisite authority to conduct its business in each other jurisdiction in

Effect, and (iv) do all things necessary to renew, extend and continue in effect
all Licenses which may at any time and from time to time be necessary for the
Borrower or any Insurance Subsidiary to operate its business in compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations. Neither Borrower nor any Insurance
Subsidiary shall change its jurisdiction of domicile or incorporation without
the prior written consent of the Required Lenders.

         6.5.     Taxes. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
timely file complete and correct tax returns required by applicable law and pay
when due all taxes, assessments and governmental charges and levies upon it or
its income, profits or Property, except those which are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which adequate reserves
have been set aside in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles or SAP,
as applicable.

         6.6.     Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

         8.1.     Acceleration. If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7
occurs with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make
Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part of
the Agent or any Lender and without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives. If any other
Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent of the
Required Lenders) may terminate or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to
make Loans hereunder, or declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both,
whereupon such obligations to make Loans shall immediately be terminated or
suspended, as the case may be, and/or the Obligations shall become immediately
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all
of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

         If, within 30 days after acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in
Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the Borrower) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or
entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the
Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration
and/or termination.

         8.2.     Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII,
the Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any
Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall,
without the consent of all of the Lenders:

         (i)      Extend the final maturity of any Loan or forgive all or any
                  portion of the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or
                  extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon.

         (ii)     Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
                  Lenders.

                                      - 35 -

<PAGE>

         (iii)    Extend the Facility Termination Date, increase the amount of
                  the Commitment of any Lender hereunder, or permit the Borrower
                  to assign its rights under this Agreement.

         (iv)     Amend this Section 8.2.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall be
effective without the written consent of the Agent. The Agent may waive payment
of the fee required under Section 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent of any
other party to this Agreement.

         8.3.     Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or
the Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right
or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and
the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability
of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in
the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be
available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in
full.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

warranties of the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive the making

         9.2.     Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit
to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

         9.3.     Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

         9.4.     Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire
agreement and understanding among the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Agent
and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof other than the fee letter
described in Section 10.13.

         9.5.     Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The
respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no
Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which
the Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform
any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of
its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer
any right or

                                      - 36 -

<PAGE>

benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that the parties hereto
expressly agree that the Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of
Sections 9.6, 9.10 and 10.11 to the extent specifically set forth therein and
shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf and in its own
name to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement.

         9.6.     Expenses; Indemnification. (i) The Borrower shall reimburse
the Agent and the Arranger for any reasonable costs, internal charges and
out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys
for the Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent) paid or incurred
by the Agent or the Arranger in connection with the preparation, negotiation,
execution, delivery, syndication, distribution (including, without limitation,
via Intralinks or a similar internet product which is available commercially),
review, amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents. The
Borrower also agrees to reimburse the Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders for
any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys'
fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders,
which attorneys may be employees of the Agent, the Arranger or the Lenders) paid
or incurred by the Agent, the Arranger or any Lender in connection with the
collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents.

         (ii) The Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify the Agent, the
Arranger and each Lender, its directors, officers and employees against all
losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation
therefor whether or not the Agent, the Arranger or any Lender is a party
thereto) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or the
direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any
Loan hereunder except to the extent that they are determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking
indemnification. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

         9.7.     Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing
documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with
sufficient counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the
Lenders.

accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.

         9.9.     Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         9.10.    Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower
on the one hand and the Lenders and the Agent on the other hand shall be solely
that of borrower and lender.

Neither the Agent, the Arranger nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary
responsibilities to the Borrower. Neither the Agent, the Arranger nor any Lender
undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower
of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's business or
operations. The Borrower agrees that neither the Agent, the Arranger nor any
Lender shall have liability to the Borrower (whether sounding in tort, contract
or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising
out of, or in any way related to, the transactions contemplated and the
relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event
occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which
recovery is sought. Neither the Agent, the Arranger nor any Lender shall have
any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives, releases and
agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect or consequential damages suffered
by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the
Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

         9.11.    Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential
information which it may receive from the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement in
confidence, except for disclosure (i) to its Affiliates and to other Lenders and
their respective Affiliates, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants, and other
professional advisors to such Lender or to a Transferee, (iii) to regulatory
officials, (iv) to any Person as requested pursuant to or as required by law,
regulation, or legal process, (v) to any Person in connection with any legal
proceeding to which such Lender is a party, (vi) to such Lender's contractual
counterparties in swap agreements or to legal counsel, accountants and other
professional advisors to such counterparties, (vii) permitted by Section 12.4
and (viii) to rating agencies if requested or required by such agencies in
connection with a rating relating to the Advances hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, confidential information shall not include, and
each Lender (and each employee, representative or other agent of any Lender) may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. "tax
treatment" and U.S. "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby
and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are or have been provided to such Lender relating to such tax treatment or tax
structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in
either case contains information concerning such tax treatment or tax structure
of the transactions contemplated hereby as well as other information, this
sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that
relate to such tax treatment or tax structure.

         9.12.    Nonreliance. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not
relying on or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) for the repayment of the Loans
provided for herein.

         9.13.    Disclosure. Each Lender hereby (i) acknowledges and agrees
that Bank One and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold other investments
in, make other loans to or have other relationships with the Borrower, and (ii)
waives any liability of Bank One or such Affiliate to the Borrower or any
Lender, respectively, arising out of or resulting from such investments, loans
or relationships other than liabilities arising out of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Bank One or its Affiliates.

                                    THE AGENT

         10.1.    Appointment; Nature of Relationship. Bank One, NA is hereby
appointed by each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein
referred to as the "Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and
each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Agent agrees to act as such
contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article
X. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent," it is expressly
understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative
of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders'
contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary
duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within
the meaning of the term "secured party" as defined in the Illinois Uniform
Commercial Code and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor, the rights and
duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim
against the Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for
breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives.

         10.2.    Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers
under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms
of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by
the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

         10.3.    General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or
any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder
or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except
to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

         10.4.    No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent
nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement,
warranty or representation made by any other Person in connection with any Loan
Document or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of
the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly
to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV,
except receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Agent; (d) the
existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (e) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness (other than its own due execution),
sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or
writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation,
perfection or priority of any Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the
financial condition of the Borrower or

                                      - 39 -

<PAGE>

any guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrower's or any such
guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose to
the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to
the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the
Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).

         10.5.    Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by
the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary
action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and
all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

         10.6.    Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of
its duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders
and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

         10.7.    Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

         10.8.    Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree
to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by
the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in
connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute
between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the

                                      - 40 -

<PAGE>

Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any
such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the
foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent. The obligations of the Lenders
under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination
of this Agreement.

         10.9.    Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
the Lenders.

         10.10.   Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The Agent, in its
individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.

         10.11.   Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         10.12.   Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. The Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause
by written notice received by the Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal
to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on
behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor Agent
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after
the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the
resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any
time without the consent of the Borrower or any Lender, appoint any of its
Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder. If the
Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Agent has been appointed,
the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent

                                      - 41 -

<PAGE>

hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations
to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the
Lenders. No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such
successor Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be
a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent. Upon
the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal
of an Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the
Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this
Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean
the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

         10.13.   Agent's and Arranger's Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Agent and the Arranger, for their own respective accounts, the fees agreed to
among the Borrower, the Agent and the Arranger, pursuant to that certain letter
agreement dated May 15, 2003, or as otherwise agreed from time to time.

         10.14.   Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrower and the Lenders agree
that the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be
entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.

         10.15.   Co-Agents, Documentation Agent, Syndication Agent, Managing
Agent, etc. Neither any of the Lenders identified in this Agreement as a
"co-agent" nor the Documentation Agent, the Syndication Agent or the Managing
Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty
under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without
limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same
acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the
Agent in Section 10.11.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

         11.1.    Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights
of the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may
be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such
Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.

                                      - 42 -

<PAGE>

         11.2.    Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received
pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that
received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such
purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender,
whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or
otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such
amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans. In case any
such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further
adjustments shall be made.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

         12.1.    Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except
that (i) the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or
obligations under the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of each
Lender, (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with
Section 12.3, and (iii) any transfer by Participation must be made in compliance
with Section 12.2. Any attempted assignment or transfer by any party not made in
compliance with this Section 12.1 shall be null and void, unless such attempted
assignment or transfer is treated as a participation in accordance with Section
12.3.2. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this
Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and this Section 12.1 does not
prohibit (x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the
case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion
of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its
obligations to its trustee; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment
creating a security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its
obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with
the provisions of Section 12.3. The Agent may treat the Person which made any
Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless
and until such Person complies with Section 12.3; provided, however, that the
Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions
from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments
relating to such Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of the rights to
any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all
the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or
consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a
Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on
any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

         12.2.    Participations.

                                      - 43 -

<PAGE>

                           12.2.1   Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender
                  may at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities
                  ("Participants") participating interests in any Loan owing to
                  such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of
                  such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the
                  Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of
                  participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
                  obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged,
                  such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
                  parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such
                  Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the holder of
                  any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes
                  under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower
                  under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had
                  not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and
                  the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
                  Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations
                  under the Loan Documents.

                           12.2.2.  Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the
                  sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant,
                  any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the
                  Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or
                  waiver with respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such
                  Participant has an interest which would require consent of all
                  of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 or of any
                  other Loan Document.

                           12.2.3.  Benefit of Certain Provisions. The Borrower
                  agrees that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right
                  of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its
                  participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan
                  Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its
                  participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender
                  under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall
                  retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with
                  respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each
                  Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant,
                  and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff
                  provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender,
                  any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of
                  setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section
                  11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender. The Borrower
                  further agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
                  benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 to the same extent
                  as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
                  assignment pursuant to Section 12.3, provided that (i) a
                  Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
                  payment under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5 than the Lender who
                  sold the participating interest to such Participant would have
                  received had it retained such interest for its own account,
                  unless the sale of such interest to such Participant is made
                  with the prior written consent of the Borrower, and (ii) such
                  Participant agrees to comply with the provisions of Section
                  3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender.

         12.3.    Assignments.

                           12.3.1.  Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may at any
                  time assign to one or more banks or other entities
                  ("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and

                                      - 44 -

                  obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be
                  substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in such other form
                  as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. Each such
                  assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender
                  or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either
                  be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and
                  Loans of the assigning Lender or (unless each of the Borrower
                  and the Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount
                  not less than $5,000,000. The amount of the assignment shall
                  be based on the Commitment or outstanding Loans (if the
                  Commitment has been terminated) subject to the assignment,
                  determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the
                  "Trade Date," if the "Trade Date" is specified in the
                  assignment.

                           12.3.2.  Consents. The written consent of the
                  Borrower shall be required prior to an assignment by any
                  Lender permitted by this Agreement becoming effective unless
                  the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an
                  Approved Fund, provided that the consent of the Borrower shall
                  not be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing.
                  The consent of the Agent shall be required prior to an
                  assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a
                  Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund. Any
                  consent required under this Section 12.3.2 shall not be
                  unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                           12.3.3.  Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to
                  the Agent of an assignment, together with any consents
                  required by Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2, and (ii) payment of a
                  $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment, such
                  assignment shall become effective on the effective date
                  specified in such assignment. The assignment shall contain a
                  representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the
                  consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and
                  Loans under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes
                  "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and
                  interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents
                  will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the
                  effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for
                  all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other
                  Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and
                  shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under
                  the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an
                  original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be
                  released with respect to the Commitment and Loans assigned to
                  such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the
                  Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent. In the case of an
                  assignment covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
                  obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
                  be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the
                  benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this
                  Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment
                  of the Obligations and termination of the applicable
                  agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
                  obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
                  this Section 12.3 shall be treated for purposes of this
                  Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
                  rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.2. Upon
                  the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to
                  this Section 12.3.3, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the
                  Borrower

                  shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that
                  its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements
                  so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are
                  issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as
                  appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser,
                  in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective
                  Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

                           12.3.4.  Register. The Agent, acting solely for this
                  purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of
                  its offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment and
                  Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation
                  of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments
                  of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender
                  pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
                  "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive,
                  and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each
                  Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
                  terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
                  Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
                  Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and
                  any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
                  reasonable prior notice.

         12.4.    Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each
Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring
an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and
any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation any information contained in any audit reports; provided that
each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of
this Agreement.

         12.5.    Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee, the transferor Lender shall cause such
Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with
the provisions of Section 3.5.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                     NOTICES

         13.1.    Notices. Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.14 with
respect to borrowing notices, all notices, requests and other communications to
any party hereunder shall be in writing (including electronic transmission,
facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (x)

forth on the signature pages hereof, (y) in the case of any Lender, at its
address or facsimile number set forth in its administrative questionnaire or (z)
in the case of any party, at such other address or facsimile number as such
party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Agent and the
Borrower in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.1. Each such
notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by
facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in
this Section and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72
hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with

first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, or (iii) if given by any
other means, when delivered (or, in the case of electronic transmission,
received) at the address specified in this Section; provided that notices to the
Agent under Article II shall not be effective until received.

         13.2.    Change of Address. The Borrower, the Agent and any Lender may
each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to
the other parties hereto.

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                                  COUNTERPARTS

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of
which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This
Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Borrower, the
Agent and the Lenders and each party has notified the Agent by facsimile
transmission or telephone that it has taken such action.

                                   ARTICLE XV

          CHOICE OF LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

         15.1.    CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING
A CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 735 ILCS SECTION 105/5-1
ET SEQ, BUT OTHERWISE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS) OF THE
STATE OF ILLINOIS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL
BANKS.

         15.2.    CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR
ILLINOIS STATE COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY
BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION
IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.
NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY
JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE BORROWER AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY
AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY
MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN
DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

                                      - 47 -

<PAGE>

         15.3.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER
HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY
WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

         15.4.    Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment
in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in
the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "specified currency") into
another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in
accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the specified
currency with such other currency at the Agent's main Chicago office on the
Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given.
The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the
Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the
specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day
following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) of any sum
adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Agent (as the
case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures
purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the
specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such
Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower
agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate
obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or
the Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the
specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender
or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts
shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a
disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 11.2, such Lender or the
Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.

         For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the
following meanings, subject to the final paragraph of this Schedule:

         "Level I Status" exists at any date if, on such date, the Borrower's
S&P Rating is AA- or better.

         "Level II Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) the Borrower
has not qualified for Level I Status and (ii) the Borrower's S&P Rating is A+ or
better.

         "Level III Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) the
Borrower has not qualified for Level I Status or Level II Status and (ii) the
Borrower's S&P Rating is A or better.

         "Level IV Status" exists at any date if, on such date, the Borrower has
not qualified for Level I Status, Level II Status or Level III Status.

         "S&P Rating" means, at any time, the rating issued by S&P and then in
effect with respect to the financial strength and counterparty credit of the
Borrower.

         "Status" means either Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status
or Level IV Status.

         The Applicable Margin and Applicable Fee Rate shall be determined in
accordance with the foregoing table based on the Borrower's Status as determined
from its then-current S&P Ratings. The credit rating in effect on any date for
the purposes of this Schedule is that in effect at the close of business on such
date. If at any time the Borrower has no S&P Rating, Level IV Status shall
exist. The Applicable Margin and the Applicable Fee Rate shall be adjusted upon
any change in the Borrower's S&P Rating.
