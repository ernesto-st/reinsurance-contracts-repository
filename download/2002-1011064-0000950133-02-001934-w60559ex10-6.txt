                        MASTER CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT


         THIS MASTER CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT is made as of the 29th day of
November, 2001 by and among (a) (i) SUNRISE RIVERSIDE ASSISTED LIVING, L.P., a
California limited partnership ("Riverside"), (ii) SUNRISE PARMA ASSISTED
LIVING, L.L.C., a Virginia limited liability company ("Parma"), (iii) SUNRISE
WILTON ASSISTED LIVING, L.L.C., a Connecticut limited liability company
("Wilton"), (iv) SUNRISE WALL ASSISTED LIVING, L.L.C., a New Jersey limited
liability company ("Wall"), and (v) SUNRISE WESTON ASSISTED LIVING, LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP, a Massachusetts limited partnership ("Weston") (individually and
collectively, Riverside, Parma, Wilton, Wall and Weston, "Borrower"), and (b)
GLASER FINANCIAL GROUP, INC., a Minnesota corporation ("Lender").

                                    RECITALS

         A. Borrower owns one or more Multifamily Residential Properties (unless
otherwise defined or the context clearly indicates otherwise, capitalized terms
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Appendix I of this Agreement)
as more particularly described in Exhibit A to this Agreement.

         B. Borrower has requested that Lender establish a $60,000,000 Credit
Facility in favor of Borrower, comprised initially of a $60,000,000 Variable
Facility, all or part of which can be converted to a Fixed Facility in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

         C. To secure the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents issued in connection with the Credit Facility, Borrower
shall create a Collateral Pool in favor of Lender. The Collateral Pool shall be
comprised of (i) Security Instruments on the Multifamily Residential Properties
listed on Exhibit A and (ii) any other Security Documents executed by Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Documents.

         D. Each Security Document shall be cross-defaulted (i.e., a default
under any Security Document, or under this Agreement, shall constitute a default
under each Security Document, and this Agreement) and cross-collateralized
(i.e., each Security Instrument shall secure all of Borrower's obligations under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents) and it is the intent of the parties
to this Agreement that Lender may accelerate any Note without needing to
accelerate any other Note and that in the exercise of its rights and remedies
under the Loan Documents, Lender may, except as provided in this Agreement,
exercise and perfect any and all of its rights in and under the Loan Documents
with regard to any Mortgaged Property without needing to exercise and perfect
its rights and remedies with respect to any other Mortgaged Property and that
any such exercise shall be without regard to the Allocable Facility Amount
assigned to such Mortgaged Property and that Lender may recover an amount equal
to the full amount outstanding in respect of any of the Notes in connection with
such exercise and any such amount shall be applied as determined by Lender in
its sole and absolute discretion.

         E. Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement,
Lender has agreed to establish the Credit Facility.

         NOW, THEREFORE, Borrower and Lender, in consideration of the mutual
promises and agreements contained in this Agreement, hereby agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE 1

                                 THE COMMITMENT

         SECTION 1.01. The Commitment.

         Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement:

                  (a) Variable Facility Commitment. Lender agrees to make
Variable Advances to Borrower from time to time during the Variable Facility
Availability Period. The aggregate principal balance of the Variable Advances
Outstanding at any time shall not exceed the Variable Facility Commitment.
Borrower may re-borrow any part of the Variable Advances which it has previously
borrowed and repaid.

                  (b) Fixed Facility Commitment. Lender agrees to make Fixed
Advances to Borrower from time to time during the Fixed Facility Availability
Period. The aggregate original principal of the Fixed Advances shall not exceed
the Fixed Facility Commitment. The borrowing of a Fixed Advance shall
permanently reduce the Fixed Facility Commitment by the original principal
amount of such Fixed Advance. Borrower may not re-borrow any part of the Fixed
Advance which it has previously borrowed and repaid.

         SECTION 1.02. Requests for Advances.

         Borrower shall request an Advance by giving Lender an Advance Request
in accordance with Section 2.04. The Advance Request shall indicate whether the
Request is for a Fixed Advance, a Variable Advance or both.

         SECTION 1.03. Maturity Date of Advances.

                  (a) Variable Advances. The MBS Issue Date shall be the first
day of a month and the maturity date of the MBS funding each Variable Advance
shall be specified by Borrower in its Advance Request, which date shall be:

                           (i) no earlier than the date which completes one full
month after the MBS Issue Date; and

                           (ii) no later than the date which completes nine full
months after the MBS Issue Date.



                                       2
<PAGE>

         For these purposes, a year shall be deemed to consist of 12 30-day
months. For example, the date which completes three full months after September
1 shall be December 1; and the date which completes three full months after
January 1 shall be April 1.

         No principal payments in respect of any Variable Advance shall be due
prior to the maturity date of such Variable Advance.

                  (b) Fixed Advances; Amortization Period. The maturity date of
each Fixed Advance shall be specified by Borrower, provided that such maturity
date shall be the 5th, 7th or 10th anniversary of the making of such Fixed
Advance, provided that in no event shall the maturity date of any Fixed Advance
be later than the 10th anniversary of the Initial Closing Date. The principal of
each Fixed Advance shall be amortized on a 25-year schedule.

                  (c) Prepayment. Fixed Advances are not prepayable at any time,
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower (i) may prepay not less
than all of any Fixed Advance during the last ninety (90) days of the term of
such Fixed Advance, and (ii) may prepay not less than all of any Fixed Advance
pursuant to the yield maintenance provisions of the Fixed Facility Note.

         SECTION 1.04. Interest on Advances.

                  (a) Partial Month Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section, if an Advance is not made on the first day of a
calendar month, and the MBS Issue Date is the first day of the month following
the month in which the Advance is made, Borrower shall pay interest on the
original stated principal amount of the Advance for the partial month period
commencing on the Closing Date for the Advance and ending on the last day of the
calendar month in which the Closing Date occurs, (i) for a Variable Advance at a
rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) the Coupon Rate as determined in
accordance with Section 1.05(a) and (2) a rate determined by Lender, based on
Lender's cost of funds and approved in advance, in writing, by Borrower,
pursuant to the procedures mutually agreed upon by Borrower and Lender, and (ii)
for a Fixed Advance at a rate, per annum equal to the greater of (1) the
interest rate for the described in subsection (c)(i) of this Section and (2) a
rate determined by Lender, based on Lender's cost of funds, and approved in
advance, in writing, by Borrower, pursuant to procedures mutually agreed upon by
Borrower and Lender.

                  (b) Variable Advances.

                           (i) Discount. Each Variable Advance shall be a
discount loan. The original stated principal amount of a Variable Advance shall
be the sum of the Price and the Discount. The Price and Discount of each
Variable Advance shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set out
in Section 2.01. The proceeds of the Variable Advance made available by Lender
to Borrower will equal the original stated principal amount of the Variable
Advance. Borrower shall pay to Lender, in advance of Lender making a Variable
Advance requested by Borrower, the entire Discount for the Variable Advance. On
the maturity of each Variable Advance, the Borrower shall pay the Lender an
amount equal to the original stated principal amount of such Variable Advance.

<PAGE>

                           (ii) Variable Facility Fee. In addition to paying the
Discount and the partial month interest, if any, Borrower shall pay monthly
installments of the Variable Facility Fee to Lender for each Variable Advance
from the applicable MBS Issue Date to its maturity date. The Variable Facility
Fee shall be payable in advance, in accordance with the terms of the Variable
Facility Note. The first installment shall be payable on or prior to the Closing
Date for the Variable Advance and shall apply to the first full calendar month
of such MBS. Subsequent installments shall be payable on the first day of each
calendar month, commencing on the first day of the second full calendar month of
such MBS, to its maturity date. Each installment of the Variable Facility Fee
shall be in an amount equal to the product of (1) the Variable Facility Fee, (2)
the original stated principal amount of the Variable Advance, and (3) 1/12.

                  (c) Fixed Advances.

                           (i) Annual Interest Rate. Each Fixed Advance shall
bear interest at a rate, per annum, equal to the sum of (1) the MBS Pass-Through
Rate for such Fixed Advance and (2) the Fixed Facility Fee.

                           (ii) Fixed Facility Fee. In addition to paying the
partial month interest, if any, Borrower shall pay monthly installments of the
MBS Pass-Through Rate and the Fixed Facility Fee to Lender for each Fixed
Advance from the applicable MBS Issue Date to its maturity date. The MBS
Pass-Through Rate and the Fixed Facility Fee shall be payable in arrears, in
accordance with the terms of the Fixed Facility Note. The first installment
shall be payable on the first day of each calendar month, commencing on the
first day of the second full calendar month of such MBS, to its maturity date.
Each installment of the Fixed Facility Fee shall be in an amount equal to the
product of (1) the Fixed Facility Fee, (2) the amount of the Fixed Advance, and
(3) 1/12.

         SECTION 1.05. Coupon Rates for Advances.

                  (a) Variable Advances. The Coupon Rate shall equal the sum of
(1) an interest rate as determined by Lender (rounded to three places) payable
for the MBS pursuant to the MBS Commitment ("MBS Imputed Interest Rate") and (2)
the Variable Facility Fee.

                  (b) Fixed Advances. The Coupon Rate shall be the rate of
interest applicable to such Fixed Advance pursuant to Section 1.04(c)(i).

         SECTION 1.06. Notes.

                  (a) Variable Advances. The obligation of Borrower to repay
shall be evidenced by the Variable Facility Note. The Variable Facility Note
shall be payable to the order of Lender and shall be made in the amount of the
Variable Facility Commitment.

                  (b) Fixed Advances. The obligation of Borrower to repay shall
be evidenced by the Fixed Facility Notes. The Fixed Facility Notes shall be
payable to the order of Lender and shall be made in the original principal
amount of each Fixed Advance.

         SECTION 1.07. Extension of Variable Facility Termination Date.

         Borrower shall have the right to extend the Variable Facility
Termination Date for one (1) five (5) year period ("Extension") upon
satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

                  (a) Borrower provides written notice requesting the Extension
("Extension Notice") to Lender not less than 30 nor more than 360 days prior to
the then effective Variable Facility Termination Date.

                  (b) No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default exists
on either the date the Extension Notice is given or on the then effective
Variable Facility Termination Date.

                  (c) All of the representations and warranties of Borrower
contained in Article 7 of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true
and correct in all material respects on the date the Extension Notice is given
and on the then effective Variable Facility Termination Date.

                  (d) Borrower is in compliance with all of the covenants
contained in Articles 8 and 9 on the date the Extension Notice is given and on
the then effective Variable Facility Termination Date.

         Upon receipt of the Extension Notice and upon compliance with
conditions set forth above, the Variable Facility Termination Date shall be
extended for five (5) years on the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Variable Facility Fee and the
Standby Fee applicable to the Variable Facility during the Extension shall be as
agreed to by the parties prior to the Extension.

         SECTION 1.08. Conversion from Variable Facility Commitment to Fixed
Facility Commitment.

         Except as provided in Section 1.09, Borrower shall have the right, from
time to time during the Fixed Facility Availability Period, to convert all or
any portion of the Variable Facility Commitment to the Fixed Facility
Commitment. The Variable Facility Commitment shall be reduced by, and the Fixed
Facility Commitment shall be increased by, the amount of each conversion.

                  (a) Request. To convert all or a portion of the Variable
Facility Commitment to the Fixed Facility Commitment, Borrower shall deliver a
Conversion Request to Lender. Each Conversion Request shall designate (1) the
amount of the conversion and (2) any Variable Advances Outstanding which will be
prepaid on or before the Closing Date for the conversion as required by Section
1.09(c).

                  (b) Closing. Subject to Section 1.09 and provided that all
conditions contained in Section 1.10 are satisfied, Lender shall permit the
requested conversion to close at offices designated by Lender on a Closing Date
selected by Lender, and occurring within 30 Business Days after Lender's receipt
of the Conversion Request (or on such other date as



                                       5
<PAGE>

Borrower and Lender may agree). At the closing, Lender and Borrower shall
execute and deliver, at the sole cost and expense of Borrower, in form and
substance satisfactory to Lender, the Conversion Documents.

         SECTION 1.09. Limitations on Right to Convert.

         Borrower's right to convert all or any portion of the Variable Facility
Commitment to the Fixed Facility Commitment is subject to the following
limitations:

                  (a) Closing Date. The Closing Date shall occur during the
Fixed Facility Availability Period.

                  (b) Minimum Request. Each Conversion Request shall be in the
minimum amount of $5,000,000.

                  (c) Obligation to Prepay Variable Advances. Borrower shall
prepay any difference by which, after the conversion, the aggregate unpaid
principal balance of all Variable Advances Outstanding will exceed the Variable
Facility Commitment.

         SECTION 1.10. Conditions to Conversion.

         The conversion of all or any portion of the Variable Facility
Commitment to the Fixed Facility Commitment is subject to the satisfaction, on
or before the Closing Date, of (a) the conditions precedent contained in Section
6.08 and (b) all applicable General Conditions contained in Section 6.01.

                                    ARTICLE 2

                                  THE ADVANCES

         SECTION 2.01. Rate Setting for an Advance.

         Rates for an Advance shall be set in accordance with the following
procedures:

                  (a) Preliminary, Nonbinding Quote. At Borrower's request
Lender shall quote an estimate of the MBS Pass-Through Rate (for a proposed
Fixed Advance) or MBS Imputed Interest Rate (for a proposed Variable Advance).
Lender's quote shall be based on (1) a solicitation of bids from institutional
investors selected by Lender and (2) the proposed terms and amount of the
Advance selected by Borrower. The quote shall not be binding upon Lender.

                  (b) Rate Setting. If Borrower satisfies all of the conditions
to Lender's obligation to make the Advance, then Borrower may submit to Lender,
by facsimile transmission before 1:00 p.m. Washington, D.C. time on any Business
Day ("Rate Setting Date"), a completed and executed Rate Form. The Rate Form
shall specify the amount, term, MBS Issue Date, Facility Fee, any breakage fee
deposit amount, the proposed maximum Coupon Rate ("Maximum Annual Coupon Rate")
and Closing Date for the Advance.



                                       6
<PAGE>

                  (c) Rate Confirmation. Within one Business Day after receipt
of the Rate Form, Lender shall solicit bids from institutional investors
selected by Lender based on the information in the Rate Form and, provided the
actual Coupon Rate (if the low bid were accepted) would be at or below the
Maximum Annual Coupon Rate, shall obtain a commitment ("MBS Commitment") for the
purchase of an MBS having the bid terms described in the related Rate Form.
Lender shall then complete and countersign the Rate Form thereby confirming the
amount, term, MBS Issue Date, MBS Delivery Date, MBS Imputed Interest Rate or
MBS Pass-Through Rate, Facility Fee, Coupon Rate, Discount, Price, and Closing
Date for the Advance and shall immediately deliver by facsimile transmission the
Rate Form to Borrower.

         SECTION 2.02. Advance Confirmation Instrument for Variable Advances.

         On or before the Closing Date for a Variable Advance, Borrower shall
execute and deliver to Lender a fully executed Advance Confirmation Instrument,
confirming the amount, term, MBS Issue Date, MBS Delivery Date, MBS Imputed
Interest Rate, Variable Facility Fee, Coupon Rate, Discount, Price and Closing
Date for the Advance, and Borrower's obligation to repay the Variable Advance in
accordance with the terms of the Variable Facility Note and this Agreement. Upon
the funding of the Variable Advance, Lender shall insert the date of funding on
the Advance Confirmation Instrument and deliver a copy of the completed Advance
Confirmation Instrument to Borrower to evidence the date of funding and to
confirm that the Advance Confirmation Instrument is not effective until the date
of funding. Lender's failure to do so shall not invalidate the Advance
Confirmation Instrument or otherwise affect in any way any obligation of
Borrower to repay Variable Advances in accordance with the Advance Confirmation
Instrument, the Variable Facility Note or the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 2.03. Breakage and other Costs.

         If Lender obtains, and then fails to fulfill, the MBS Commitment
because the Advance is not made (for a reason other than Lender's default),
Borrower shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs payable to the potential
investor and other reasonable costs, fees and damages incurred by Lender in
connection with its failure to fulfill the MBS Commitment. Lender reserves the
right to require Borrower to post a deposit at the time the MBS Commitment is
obtained. Such deposit shall be refundable to Borrower upon the delivery of the
related MBS.

         SECTION 2.04. Advances.

         Borrower may deliver an Advance Request to Lender.

                  (a) If the Advance Request is to obtain the Initial Advance
and all conditions precedent contained in Section 6.02 and the General
Conditions contained in Section 6.01 are satisfied on or before the Closing Date
for the Initial Advance, Lender shall make the Initial Advance on the Initial
Closing Date or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree.

                  (b) If the Advance Request is to obtain a Future Advance, such
Advance Request shall be in the minimum amount of $3,000,000, provided that the
limitation set forth in this sentence shall not apply to Future Advances made
simultaneously with a Rollover Variable



                                       7
<PAGE>

Advance. Borrower may have one or more Advances of not less than $3,000,000 even
though such Advances are made on the same day and mature on the same date. If
all conditions precedent contained in Section 6.03 and the General Conditions
contained in Section 6.01 are satisfied, Lender shall make the requested Future
Advance, at a closing to be held at offices designated by Lender on a Closing
Date selected by Lender, which date shall be not more than three (3) Business
Days after Borrower's receipt from Lender of the confirmed Rate Form (or on such
other date as Borrower and Lender may agree).

                  (c) Borrower shall be entitled, from time to time, to
additional Advances based on increases in the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio or
in the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratios as determined by Lender annually.
The amount of such additional Advances shall be equal to the amount which, when
combined with Advances already Outstanding, equals the Borrowing Up Limitation.
No such additional Advances shall be permitted if the Variable Facility
Commitment has been terminated, or if there are Outstanding Advances in the full
amount of the Variable Facility Commitment and the Fixed Facility Commitment.

         SECTION 2.05. Determination of Allocable Facility Amount and
Valuations.

                  (a) Initial Determinations. On the Initial Closing Date,
Lender shall determine (i) the Allocable Facility Amount and Valuation for each
Mortgaged Property and (ii) the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the
Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio. Determinations made pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be made (i) for five and seven year Fixed Advances, based on an
underwriting interest rate of 7.75%, and (ii) for 10 year Fixed Advances, based
on an underwriting interest rate of 6.5%. The determinations made as of the
Initial Closing Date shall remain unchanged until the first anniversary of the
Initial Closing Date.

                  (b) Monitoring Determinations. (i) Once each Calendar Quarter
or, if the Commitment consists only of a Fixed Facility Commitment, once each
Calendar Year, within 20 Business Days after Borrower has delivered to Lender
the reports required in Section 8.03, Lender shall determine the Aggregate Debt
Service Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and calculations
required in connection with the other covenants set forth in the Loan Documents,
and whether the Borrower is in compliance, (ii) after the first anniversary of
the Initial Closing Date, on an annual basis, and if Lender reasonably decides
that changed market or property conditions warrant, Lender shall determine
Allocable Facility Amounts and Valuations, (iii) Lender shall also redetermine
Allocable Facility Amounts to take account of any addition, release or
substitution of Collateral or other event which invalidates the outstanding
determinations. In determining the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio, if the
Borrower has purchased an interest rate cap that (1) is from a cap provider
acceptable to Lender, in its sole discretion, (2) contains terms and conditions
acceptable to Lender, in its sole discretion, and (3) is assigned to Lender as
security for the Obligations, Lender shall determine the portion of the
Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio attributable to the Variable Facility
based on the lower of (A) the actual interest rate for the Variable Facility for
such period and (B) the rate provided by the interest rate cap. In determining
Valuations, Lender shall use Cap Rates based on its internal survey and analysis
of cap rates for comparable sales in the vicinity of the Mortgaged Property,
with such adjustments as Lender deems appropriate and without any obligation to
use



                                       8
<PAGE>

any information provided by Borrower. If Lender is unable to determine a Cap
Rate for a Mortgaged Property, Lender shall have the right, not more than once
annually, to obtain a market study in order to establish a Cap Rate. Lender
shall promptly disclose its determinations to Borrower. Until redetermined, the
outstanding Allocable Facility Amounts and Valuations shall remain in effect.
Fixed Advances based on increased Valuations or additions to the Collateral Pool
and expansion of the Facility shall be based on underwriting floors determined
by Lender from time to time. During the first Loan Year a Mortgaged Property is
in the Collateral Pool, all calculations of Aggregate Debt Service Coverage and
Aggregate Loan to Value Ratios including such Mortgaged Property shall be based
on actual operations of such Mortgaged Property during the period the Mortgaged
Property was in the Collateral Pool and underwriting proforma results for the
remainder of such Loan Year.

                               COLLATERAL CHANGES

         SECTION 3.01. Right to Add Collateral.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article, Borrower shall
have the right, from time to time during the Term of this Agreement, to add
Multifamily Residential Properties to the Collateral Pool.

         SECTION 3.02. Procedure for Adding Collateral.

         The procedure for adding Collateral contained in this Section 3.02
shall apply to all additions of Collateral including, but not limited to,
additions of Collateral in connection with substitutions of Collateral and
expansion of the Credit Facility.

                  (a) Request. Borrower may deliver to Lender an Addition
Request to add one or more Multifamily Residential Properties to the Collateral
Pool. Each Addition Request shall be accompanied by the following: (i) the
information required by the DUS Guide Underwriting Requirements and any
additional information Lender may reasonably request; and (ii) the payment of
all Additional Collateral Due Diligence Fees.

                  (b) Underwriting. Lender shall evaluate the proposed
Additional Mortgaged Property in accordance with the DUS Guide Underwriting
Requirements, and shall make underwriting determinations as to the Aggregate
Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio applicable to
the Collateral Pool on the basis of the lesser of (1) the acquisition price of
the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property if purchased by Borrower within 12
months of the related Addition Request, and (2) a Valuation made with respect to
the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property. Within 30 Business Days (provided
that Lender shall use reasonable efforts to respond sooner) after receipt of (1)
the Addition Request and (2) all reports, certificates and documents required by
the DUS Guide Underwriting Requirements, including a zoning analysis undertaken
in accordance with Section 206 of Part III of the DUS Guide, Lender shall notify
Borrower whether it shall consent to the Addition Request. If Lender



                                       9
<PAGE>

consents it shall set forth the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the
Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio which it estimates shall result from the addition
of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property. Within 30 Business Days after
receipt of Lender's consent to the Addition Request, Borrower shall notify
Lender whether it elects to add the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property to
the Collateral Pool. If Borrower fails to respond within the period of 30
Business Days, it shall be conclusively deemed to have elected not to add the
proposed Additional Mortgaged Property to the Collateral Pool.

                  (c) Closing. If Lender consents to the Addition Request,
Borrower timely elects to add the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property to the
Collateral Pool and all conditions precedent contained in Section 6.04 and all
General Conditions contained in Section 6.01 are satisfied, Lender shall permit
the addition of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property to the Collateral
Pool, at a closing to be held at offices designated by Lender on a Closing Date
selected by Lender, occurring within 30 Business Days after Lender's receipt of
Borrower's election (or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree).

         SECTION 3.03. Right to Obtain Releases of Collateral.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article, Borrower shall
have the right to obtain a release of Collateral from the Collateral Pool.

         SECTION 3.04. Procedure for Obtaining Releases of Collateral.

                  (a) Request. To obtain a release of Collateral from the
Collateral Pool, Borrower may deliver a Release Request to Lender. The Release
Request shall not result in a termination of all or any part of the Credit
Facility. Borrower may terminate all or any part of the Credit Facility only by
delivering a Facility Termination Request or Credit Facility Termination Request
pursuant to Article 5.

                  (b) Closing. If all conditions precedent contained in Section
6.05 and all General Conditions contained in Section 6.01 are satisfied, Lender
shall cause the Release Property to be released, at a closing to be held at
offices designated by Lender on a Closing Date selected by Lender, and occurring
not less than 15 days after Lender's receipt of the Release Request (or on such
other date as Borrower and Lender may agree), by executing and delivering, and
causing all applicable parties to execute and deliver, all at the sole cost and
expense of Borrower, the Release Documents. Borrower shall prepare the Release
Documents and submit them to Lender for its review.

                  (c) Release Price. The Release Price for each Mortgaged
Property shall be the greater of (i) the Allocable Facility Amount for the
Release Property and (ii) the amount of any Advances Outstanding which are
required to be repaid by Borrower to Lender so that, immediately after the
release, the Coverage and LTV Tests will be satisfied. In addition, Borrower
shall pay to Lender all other amounts due under the Notes and any Advance
Confirmation Instruments evidencing the Advances being repaid.



                                       10
<PAGE>

                  (d) Application of Release Price. The Release Price shall be
applied first against the Variable Advances Outstanding until there are no
further Variable Advances Outstanding, then against the prepayment of Fixed
Advances Outstanding, so long as the prepayment is permitted under the
applicable Fixed Facility Note. If, on the date Borrower pays the Release Price,
Variable Advances are Outstanding but not then due and payable, Lender shall
hold the Release Price in an interest-bearing account as additional Collateral,
until the next date on which Variable Advances are due and payable, at which
time Lender shall apply the appropriate portion of the Release Price to such
Variable Advances.

         SECTION 3.05. Right to Substitute Collateral.

         Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Section 3.05,
Borrower shall have the right to add one or more Multifamily Residential
Properties to the Collateral Pool in substitution of one or more Mortgaged
Properties then in the Collateral Pool ("Substitute Mortgaged Property").

         SECTION 3.06. Procedure for Substituting Collateral.

                  (a) Request. Borrower may deliver to Lender a Substitution
Request to add one or more Multifamily Residential Properties in substitution of
one or more Mortgaged Properties then in the Collateral Pool. Each Substitution
Request shall be accompanied by

                           (i) the information required by the DUS Guide
Underwriting Requirements and any additional information Lender may reasonably
request; and (ii) a statement whether the addition of the Substitute Mortgaged
Property will occur simultaneously with the release of the Release Property and,
if not, the proposed date on which the Substitute Mortgaged Property will be
added to the Collateral Pool which, in no event, shall be a date which is more
than 90 days after the proposed date of the release of the Release Property.

                  (b) Underwriting. Borrower may add any Substitute Mortgaged
Property provided that, after the substitution, the Coverage and LTV Tests are
satisfied. Lender shall make underwriting determinations as to the Aggregate
Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio immediately
prior to and immediately after giving effect to the proposed substitution, and
the Valuation and the Net Operating Income for both the Substitute Mortgaged
Property and the Release Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, underwriting determinations with respect to the proposed
Substitute Mortgaged Property shall be made on the basis of a Valuation and
otherwise in accordance with the DUS Guide Underwriting Requirements. Within 30
days after receipt of (i) the Substitution Request and (ii) all reports,
certificates and documents required under the DUS Guide, including a zoning
analysis undertaken in accordance with Section 206 of Part III of the DUS Guide,
Lender shall notify Borrower whether Lender shall consent to Substitution
Request. If Lender consents, it shall set forth the Aggregate Debt Service
Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio which it estimates shall
result from the substitution of the Substitute Mortgaged Property into the
Collateral Pool. Within 30 days after receipt of Lender's consent notice,
Borrower shall notify Lender whether it elects to cause such substitution to
occur. If Borrower fails to respond



                                       11
<PAGE>

within the period of 30 days, it shall be conclusively deemed to have elected
not to cause the proposed substitution to occur.

                  (c) Closing. If Lender consents to the Substitution Request,
Borrower timely elects to cause such substitution to occur and all conditions
precedent contained in Section 6.06 and all General Conditions contained in
Section 6.01 are satisfied, Lender shall permit the Substitute Mortgaged
Property to be substituted into the Collateral Pool in replacement of the
Release Property, at a closing to be held at offices designated by Lender on a
Closing Date selected by Lender, and occurring

                           (i) if the addition of the Substitute Mortgaged
Property and the release of the Release Property are to occur simultaneously,
within 30 days after Lender's receipt of Borrower's election (or on such other
date as Borrower and Lender may agree); or

                           (ii) if the addition of the Substitute Mortgaged
Property is to occur subsequent to the release of the Release Property, within
90 days after the release of the Release Property.

If, in the case of clause (ii) of this paragraph, the addition of the Substitute
Mortgaged Property to the Collateral Pool does not occur within 90 days or such
longer period as approved by Lender, in its sole discretion, after the release
of the Release Property, then Borrower shall have waived its right to substitute
such Release Property with the Substitute Mortgaged Property, the Release Price
shall be determined pursuant to Section 3.04(c) and Borrower shall comply with
the requirement contained in Section 3.04(d). Such Release Price, or the
applicable portion thereof, shall be immediately due and payable by Borrower to
Lender to reduce the Advances Outstanding as required by, and in the manner
contained in, Section 3.04(d).

                  (d) Restriction on Borrowings. If the addition of the
Substitute Mortgaged Property and the release of the Release Property does not
occur simultaneously then, until the addition of the Substitute Mortgaged
Property, the aggregate unpaid principal balance of Advances Outstanding shall
not exceed the amount of the then-existing Commitment minus the Allocable
Facility Amount of the Release Property, unless Borrower has delivered
additional Collateral reasonably acceptable to Lender in an amount at least
equal to such Allocable Facility Amount. If the aggregate unpaid principal
balance of Advances Outstanding exceeds such amount (and satisfactory additional
Collateral has not been delivered by Borrower to Lender), Borrower shall pay
such excess as a condition precedent to the addition of a Substitute Mortgaged
Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the value of the
additional Collateral exceed 15% of the principal balance of the Advances
Outstanding. Any payment received by Lender under this Section shall be applied
against Advances Outstanding in the manner prescribed for Release Prices
pursuant to Section 3.04(d). The additional Collateral shall be released to
Borrower upon the addition of the applicable Substitute Mortgaged Property to
the Collateral Pool.

                          EXPANSION OF CREDIT FACILITY

         SECTION 4.01. Right to Increase Commitment.

         Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Article,
Borrower shall have the right, during the Fixed Facility Availability Period, to
increase the Fixed Facility Commitment and, during the Variable Facility Advance
Period, to increase the Variable Facility Commitment. Either Commitment may be
increased by the addition of Collateral to the Collateral Pool and/or increases
in the value of the Mortgaged Properties. Borrower's right to increase the
Commitment is subject to the following limitations:

                  (a) Maximum Amount of Increase in Commitment. The maximum
amount by which the Commitment may be increased is $40,000,000.

                  (b) Minimum Request. Each Request for an increase in the
Commitment shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000.

                  (c) Terms and Conditions. The terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall apply to any increase in the Commitment closed prior to the
First Anniversary. Thereafter, the Variable Facility Fee, Fixed Facility Fee and
Standby Fee applicable to any increase in the Commitment shall be mutually
agreed upon by Lender and Borrower; provided, however, that if Borrower incurs a
Standby Fee, then the Variable Facility Fee and Fixed Facility Fee shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 10.01 of this Agreement, remain unchanged
for so long as the Commitment is outstanding and the Standby Fee is paid.

         SECTION 4.02. Procedure for Obtaining Increases in Commitment.

                  (a) Request. To obtain an increase in the Commitment, Borrower
shall deliver an Expansion Request to Lender. Each Expansion Request shall
include the following:

                           (i) The total amount of the proposed increase;

                           (ii) A designation of the increase as being part of
the Fixed Facility Commitment and/or the Variable Facility Commitment;

                           (iii) A request that Lender inform Borrower of any
change in the Geographical Diversification Requirements; and

                           (iv) If the increase in the Commitment is to close
after the date one year after the date hereof, a request that Lender inform
Borrower of the Fixed Facility Fee and/or the Variable Facility Fee to apply to
Advances drawn from such increase in the Commitment.

                  (b) Closing. If all conditions precedent contained in Section
6.07 and all General Conditions contained in Section 6.01 are satisfied, Lender
shall permit the Expansion



                                       13
<PAGE>

Request to occur, at a closing to be held at offices designated by Lender on a
Closing Date selected by Lender, and occurring not less than fifteen (15)
Business Days after Lender's receipt of the Expansion Request (or on such other
date as Borrower and Lender may agree).

                                    ARTICLE 5

                            TERMINATION OF FACILITIES

         SECTION 5.01. Right to Complete or Partial Termination of Facilities.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article, Borrower shall
have the right to permanently reduce the Variable Facility Commitment and/or the
Fixed Facility Commitment.

         SECTION 5.02. Procedure for Complete or Partial Termination of
Facilities.

of Default, as such terms are defined in this Agreement.

                           (vi) A Transfer of a Mortgaged Property to a wholly
owned Affiliate of Sunrise, so long as such entity meets the requirements of a
"Borrower" under this Agreement, makes the representations and warranties made
by the Borrower under this Agreement, and executes such documents as Lender may
reasonably require to evidence such entity's obligations under the Loan
Documents.

                           (vii) A Joint Venture Transfer.

transferee of one or more individuals or entities acceptable to Lender of an
assumption agreement that is acceptable to Lender and that, among other things,
requires the transferee to perform all obligations of transferor or such person

any provisions of this Instrument or any other Loan Document which previously
may have been waived by Lender;

information required by Lender to evaluate the easement, and if Lender consents
to such easement based upon Lender's determination that the easement will not
materially affect the operation of the Mortgaged Property or Lender's interest
in the Mortgaged Property and Borrower pays to Lender, on demand, all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with reviewing Borrower's
request. Lender shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to or withhold its
agreement to subordinate the lien of a Security Instrument to (A) the grant of a
utility easement serving a Mortgaged Property to a publicly operated utility, or
(B) the grant of an easement related to expansion or widening of roadways,
provided that any such easement is in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Lender and does not materially and adversely affect the access, use or
marketability of a Mortgaged Property.

         SECTION 12.01. Remedies; Waivers.

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may do any one or
more of the following (without presentment, protest or notice of protest, all of

<PAGE>

                  (a) by written notice to Borrower, to be effective upon
dispatch, terminate the Commitment and declare the principal of, and interest
on, the Advances and all other sums owing by Borrower to Lender under any of the

and injunctive relief.

         SECTION 12.02. Waivers; Rescission of Declaration.

         Lender shall have the right, to be exercised in its complete
discretion, to waive any breach hereunder (including the occurrence of an Event
of Default), by a writing setting forth the terms, conditions, and extent of
such waiver signed by Lender and delivered to Borrower. Unless such writing
expressly provides to the contrary, any waiver so granted shall extend only to
the specific event or occurrence which gave rise to the waiver and not to any
other similar event or occurrence which occurs subsequent to the date of such
waiver.

         SECTION 12.03. Lender's Right to Protect Collateral and Perform
Covenants and Other Obligations.

         If Borrower or Sunrise fails to perform the covenants and agreements

conditions of the ground lease. Any amounts disbursed by Lender pursuant to this

secured by the Loan Documents. Unless Borrower and Lender agree to other terms
of payment, such amounts shall be immediately due and payable and shall bear
interest from the date of disbursement at the weighted average, as determined by
Lender, of the interest rates in effect from time to time for each Advance
unless collection from Borrower of interest at such rate would be contrary to
applicable law, in which event such amounts shall bear interest at the highest
rate which may be collected from Borrower under applicable law. Nothing
contained in this Section shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any
action hereunder.

         SECTION 12.04. No Remedy Exclusive.

remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to other remedies given
under the Loan Documents or existing at law or in equity.

         SECTION 12.05. No Waiver.

         No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing under any
Loan Document upon the happening of any Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a
waiver thereof, but any such right and power may be exercised from time to time
and as often as may be deemed expedient.

         SECTION 12.06. No Notice.

         To entitle Lender to exercise any remedy reserved to Lender in this
Article, it shall not be necessary to give any notice, other than such notice as

Documents contemplated in Section 13.02, Lender shall not have the right or
power to effect a release of any Collateral pursuant to Article 6. Borrower
acknowledges that the Security Instruments provide for the release of the
Collateral under Articles 3 and 5. Accordingly, Borrower shall not look to
Lender for performance of any obligations contained in Articles 3 and 5, but
shall look solely to the party secured by the Collateral to be released for such
performance. Lender represents and warrants to Borrower that the party secured
by the Collateral shall be subject to the release provisions contained in
Articles 3 and 5 by virtue of the release provisions in each Security
Instrument.

Fannie Mae's then current standards for lenders for credit facilities of the

obligations of Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and/or
any related servicing obligations, and, at Fannie Mae's option, the concurrent
release of Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, and/or any related servicing obligations, and shall execute all
releases, modifications and other documents which Fannie Mae determines are
necessary or desirable to effect such assumption.

         SECTION 13.05. Fannie Mae and Lender Fees and Expenses.

         Borrower agree that any provision providing for the payment of fees,
costs or expenses incurred or charged by Lender pursuant to this Agreement shall
be deemed to provide for Borrower's payment of all reasonable fees, costs and
expenses incurred or charged by Lender or Fannie Mae in connection with the
matter for which fees, costs or expenses are payable.

         SECTION 13.06. Third-Party Beneficiary.

         Borrower hereby acknowledge and agree that Fannie Mae is a third party
beneficiary of all of the representations, warranties and covenants made by
Borrower to, and all rights under this Agreement conferred upon, Lender, and, by
virtue of its status as third-party beneficiary and/or assignee of Lender's
rights under this Agreement, Fannie Mae shall have the right to enforce all of
the provisions of this Agreement against Borrower.

                  (a) Full Recourse. The Borrower is and shall remain personally
liable to the Lender for the payment and performance of all Obligations
throughout the term of this Agreement.

                  (b) Transfer Not Release. No Transfer by any Person of its
Ownership Interests in the Borrower shall release the Borrower from liability
under this Article, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, unless the Lender
shall have approved the Transfer and shall have expressly released the Borrower
in connection with the Transfer.

                  (c) Miscellaneous. The Lender may exercise its rights against
the Borrower personally without regard to whether the Lender has exercised any
rights against the Mortgaged Property or any other security, or pursued any
rights against any guarantor, or pursued any other rights available to the
Lender under the Loan Documents or applicable law. For purposes of this Article,
the term "Mortgaged Property" shall not include any funds that (1) have been
applied by the Borrower as required or permitted by the Loan Documents prior to
the occurrence of an Event of Default, or (2) are owned by the Borrower and

Documents because of a bankruptcy, receivership, or similar judicial proceeding.

similar tax on Lender. Any attorneys' fees and expenses payable by Borrower
pursuant to this Section shall be recoverable separately from and in addition to
any other amount included in such judgment, and such obligation is intended to
be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and to survive and not
be merged into any such judgment. Any amounts payable by Borrower pursuant to
this Section, with interest thereon if not paid when due, shall become
additional indebtedness of Borrower secured by the Loan Documents. Such amounts
shall bear interest from the date such amounts are due until paid in full at the
weighted average, as determined by Lender, of the interest rates in effect from
time to time for each Advance unless collection from Borrower of interest at
such rate would be contrary to applicable law, in which event such amounts shall
bear interest at the highest rate which may be



                                       43

collected from Borrower under applicable law. The provisions of this Section are
cumulative with, and do not exclude the application and benefit to Lender of,
any provision of any other Loan Document relating to any of the matters covered
by this Section.

         SECTION 17.04. Payment Procedure.

         All payments to be made to Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents shall be made in lawful currency of the United States of
America and in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated by Lender before 2:00 p.m. (Washington, D.C. time) on the date when
due.

         SECTION 17.05. Payments on Business Days.

         In any case in which the date of payment to Lender or the expiration of
any time period hereunder occurs on a day which is not a Business Day, then such
payment or expiration of such time period need not occur on such date but may be
made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on the day of maturity or expiration of such period, except that interest
shall continue to accrue for the period after such date to the next Business
Day.

         SECTION 17.06. Choice of Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial.

TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH THE RIGHT TO
A JURY TRIAL WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. FURTHER, THE BORROWER AND SUNRISE HEREBY
CERTIFY THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF LENDER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, LENDER'S COUNSEL) HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, TO THE BORROWER
AND SUNRISE THAT LENDER WILL NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS WERE KNOWINGLY, WILLINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO BY
BORROWER AND SUNRISE UPON CONSULTATION WITH INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL SELECTED
BY BORROWER'S AND SUNRISE'S FREE WILL.
