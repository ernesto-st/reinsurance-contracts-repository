handling of a claim under a Policy subject to this Contract, in rejecting a settlement
within the Policy Limits, in discharging a duty to defend or prepare the defense in the
trial of an action against its insured, or in discharging its duty to prepare or prosecute
an appeal consequent upon such an action. For the avoidance of doubt, the decision by the
Reinsured to settle a claim for an amount within the coverage of the Policy but not within
the Policy limit when the Reinsured has reasonable basis to believe that it may have
liability to its insured or assignee or other third party on the claim will be deemed a
Loss Excess of Policy Limits.

overdue, as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus four hundred (400)&nbsp;basis points to be
