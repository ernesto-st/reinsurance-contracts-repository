SECTION 2.        AMOUNT OF COMMITMENTS; CERTAIN TERMS OF PAYMENT AND REPAYMENT

         2.1      LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS; REGISTER; DEFAULT RATE;
                  COMPUTATION OF INTEREST; MAXIMUM RATE.

                  A.       LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and
warranties of Borrowers herein set forth, each Lender agrees to purchase in
accordance with subsection 3.1C participations in each Letter of Credit and any
drawings honored thereunder, in an aggregate amount not exceeding its Pro Rata
Share of the Letter of Credit Commitments. The original amount of each Lender's
Letter of Credit Commitment is set forth opposite its name on Schedule 2.1
annexed hereto and the aggregate original amount of the Letter of Credit
Commitments is $138,191,554.19; provided, however, that the Letter of Credit
Commitments of Lenders shall be adjusted to give effect to any assignments of
the Letter of Credit Commitments pursuant to subsection 10.1B and shall be
reduced from time to time by the amount of any reductions thereto made pursuant
to subsection 2.3. Each Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment shall expire on the
Maturity Date.

                  B.       THE REGISTER. Administrative Agent, acting for these
purposes solely as an agent of Borrowers (it being acknowledged that
Administrative Agent, in such capacity, and its officers, directors, employees,
agent and affiliates shall constitute Indemnitees under subsection 10.3), shall
maintain (and make available for inspection by Borrowers and Lenders upon
reasonable prior notice at reasonable times) at its address referred to in
subsection 10.8 a register for the recordation of, and shall record, the names
and addresses of Lenders and the

                                       35
<PAGE>

Letter of Credit Commitment and participations in Letters of Credit of each
Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER"). Borrowers, Administrative Agent and
Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as
the holders and owners of the corresponding Letter of Credit Commitments and
participations listed therein for all purposes hereof; all amounts owed with
respect to any Letter of Credit Commitment or participation shall be owed to the
Lender listed in the Register as the owner thereof; and any request, authority
or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the
corresponding Letter of Credit Commitment or participation. Each Lender shall
record on its internal records the amount of its participations and Letter of
Credit Commitment and each payment in respect hereof, and any such recordation
shall be conclusive and binding on Borrowers, absent manifest error, subject to
the entries in the Register, which shall, absent manifest error, govern in the
event of any inconsistency with any Lender's records. Failure to make any
recordation in the Register or in any Lender's records, or any error in such
recordation, shall not affect any participations or Letter of Credit Commitments
or any Obligations in respect of any participations.

                  C.       DEFAULT RATE. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of any Event of Default, any fees and other amounts then due and
payable hereunder (but not including amounts drawn under any Letter of Credit
that are not reimbursed by Borrowers when required under subsection 3.3) shall
thereafter bear interest (including post petition interest in any proceeding
under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable upon
demand at a rate equal to the Base Rate plus 5.00% per annum. Payment or
acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in this subsection
2.1C is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a
waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or
remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender.

                  D.       COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on amounts bearing
interest with reference to the Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a
360-day year, for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which
it accrues. In computing interest on any amount funded in a drawing under a
Letter of Credit, the date of the funding of such drawing shall be included; and
the date of payment of such funded drawing shall be excluded; provided that if a
funded drawing is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's interest
shall be paid on that funded drawing.

                  E.       MAXIMUM RATE. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this subsection 2.1, in no event shall the rate of interest
payable by Borrowers with respect to any funded drawing under any Letter of
Credit exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged under
applicable law.

         2.2      FEES.

                  A.       FACILITY FEES. Borrowers, jointly and severally,

                  Agreement requires application of such Mandatory Payment in a
                  different manner than as set forth in this sentence, any
                  Mandatory Payments made pursuant to subsections 2.3A(i)(a) -
                  (e) shall be applied to repay funded amounts, if any, under
                  the Letters of Credit and then to cash collateralize the
                  Letters of Credit and the Letter of Credit Commitments under
                  the Collateral Account Agreement in an amount, taken together
                  with all then existing cash collateral for the Letter of
                  Credit Commitments, equal to 105% of the Letter of Credit
                  Commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrowers and
                  Lenders hereby agree that any cash applied to collateralize
                  Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to subsection 2.3A(i)(f)
                  with respect to a cash balance on June 30 or December 31 of
                  any Fiscal Year (the "SUBJECT FISCAL YEAR") shall, in the
                  event that the amount of such cash applied to collateralize
                  Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds 50% of the Annual Free Cash
                  Flow for the Subject Fiscal Year, be released to Borrowers to
                  the extent of such excess (but in no event shall more cash be
                  so released than the aggregate amount applied pursuant to
                  subsection 2.3A(i)(f) with respect to the Subject Fiscal Year)
                  after the 60th day of the following Fiscal Year, promptly
                  following Borrowers' certification of such excess; provided,
                  however, that such release shall not be required if, at the
                  time such release would otherwise be required, an Event of
                  Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and provided,
                  further, that to the extent the Intercreditor Agreement
                  requires application of such amounts in a different manner
                  than as set forth in this sentence, such amounts shall be
                  applied in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

                  (iii)    Mandatory Reduction of Letter of Credit Commitments.
         Immediately upon the occurrence of any Permanent L/C Obligation
         Reduction, the Letter of Credit Commitments shall be permanently
         reduced in an amount equal to the amount of such Permanent L/C
         Obligation Reduction, and such reduction of the Letter of Credit
         Commitments shall reduce each Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment
         ratably.

                  B.       GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENTS.

                  (i)      Manner and Time of Payment. All payments by Borrowers
         of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made in
         Dollars in same day funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim,
         free of any restriction or condition, and delivered to Administrative
         Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date due at
         the Funding and Payment Office for the account of Lenders; funds
         received by Administrative Agent after that time on such due date shall
         be deemed to have been paid by Borrowers on the next succeeding
         Business Day. Each Borrower hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to
         charge its accounts with Administrative Agent in order to cause timely
         payment to be made to Administrative Agent of all principal, interest,
         fees and expenses due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds being
         available in its accounts for that purpose). Anything contained herein
         to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrowers jointly and severally
         promise to repay all honored drawings under the Letters of Credit when
         due in accordance with the terms hereof and agree that, to the extent
         any Letters of Credit have not been returned and cancelled, on the
         Maturity Date (a) the unpaid principal amount of, and accrued interest
         on, any funded amounts under such Letters of Credit, (b) an amount
         equal to the maximum available amount that may at any time on or after
         such date be drawn under all such Letters of Credit then outstanding
         (whether or not any beneficiary under any such Letter of Credit shall
         have presented, or shall be entitled at such time to present, the
         drafts or other documents or certificates required to draw under such
         Letter of Credit), and (c) all other Obligations shall automatically
         become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand,
         protest or other requirements of any kind, all of which are hereby
         expressly waived by Borrowers, and any amounts so due and payable with
         respect to Letters of Credit shall be cash collateralized in an amount
         equal to 105% of the amount thereof.

                  (ii)     Application of Payments to Principal and Interest.
         All payments in respect of any honored drawing under a Letter of Credit
         shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being
         repaid or prepaid, and all such payments shall be applied to the
         payment of interest before application to principal.

                  (iii)    Payments on Business Days. Whenever any payment to be
         made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a
         Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
         Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the
         computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the commitment
         fees hereunder, as the case may be.

                  C.       APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL AND PAYMENTS
AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. Except to the extent the Intercreditor Agreement
requires application in a different manner than as set forth in this subsection
2.3C, upon the occurrence and during the continuation

                                       40
<PAGE>

of an Event of Default, either if requested by Requisite Lenders or upon
termination of the Letter of Credit Commitments (a) all Mandatory Payments or
other payments received on account of the Obligations, whether from any Borrower
or otherwise, shall be applied by Administrative Agent against the Obligations
and (b) all proceeds received by Administrative Agent in respect of any sale of,
collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral
may, in the discretion of Administrative Agent, be held by Administrative Agent
as Collateral for, and/or (then or at any time thereafter) applied in full or in
part by Administrative Agent against, the applicable Secured Obligations (as
defined in the Collateral Documents), in each case in the following order of
priority:

                  (i)      to the payment of all costs and expenses of such
         sale, collection or other realization, all other expenses, liabilities
         and advances made or incurred by Administrative Agent in connection
         therewith, and all amounts for which Agents are entitled to
         compensation (including the fees described in subsection 2.2),
         reimbursement and indemnification under any Credit Document and all
         advances made by Administrative Agent thereunder for the account of the
         applicable Credit Party, and to the payment of all costs and expenses
         paid or incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with the Credit
         Documents, all in accordance with subsections 9.4, 10.2 and 10.3 and
         the other terms of this Agreement and the Credit Documents;

                  (ii)     thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         proceeds, first, to repay owed and outstanding amounts (subject to the
         provisions of subsection 2.3B(ii) hereof) with respect to Letter of
         Credit Exposure, with the remainder applied to cash collateralize
         Letter of Credit Exposure and unutilized Letter of Credit Commitments
         (it being understood that for purposes of this clause (ii), the portion
         of such Letter of Credit Exposure that consists of unutilized Letter of
         Credit Commitments or undrawn amounts under outstanding Letters of
         Credit shall be measured at 105% of the amount thereof), for the
         ratable benefit of the holders thereof; and

                  (iii)    thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         proceeds, to the payment to or upon the order of such Credit Party or
         to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court
         of competent jurisdiction may direct.

         2.4      INCREASED COSTS; TAXES; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

                  A.       COMPENSATION FOR INCREASED COSTS. Subject to the
provisions of subsection 2.4B (which shall be controlling with respect to the
matters covered thereby), in the event that any Lender (including any Issuing
Lender) shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty
or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change therein or in the
interpretation, administration or application thereof (including the
introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order),
or any determination of a court or other Government Authority, in each case that
becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender with any
guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date hereof by any
central bank or other Government Authority (whether or not having the force of
law):

                                       41
<PAGE>

                  (i)      subjects such Lender to any additional Tax (other
         than any withholding tax with respect to which subsection 2.4B applies)
         with respect to this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder
         (including with respect to issuing or maintaining any Letters of Credit
         or purchasing or maintaining any participations therein or maintaining
         any Letter of Credit Commitment hereunder) or any payments to such
         Lender of principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable
         hereunder;

                  (ii)     imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
         requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in
         or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit
         extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such
         Lender; or

                  (iii)    imposes any other condition (other than with respect
         to Taxes) on or affecting such Lender or its obligations hereunder;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make, making or maintaining its Letter of Credit Commitments or
agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to
purchase, purchasing or maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any
amount received or receivable by such Lender with respect thereto; then, in any
such case, Borrowers shall promptly pay, on a joint and several basis, to such
Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in subsection 2.5A, such
additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a
different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its
sole discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender
on an after-tax basis for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts
received or receivable hereunder.

                  B.       TAXES.

                  (i)      Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums payable by
         Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be
         paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on
         account of, any Tax imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by
         or within the United States or any political subdivision in or of the
         United States or any other jurisdiction from or to which a payment is
         made by or on behalf of Borrowers or by any federation or organization
         of which the United States or any such jurisdiction is a member at the
         time of payment.

                  (ii)     Grossing-up of Payments. If any Borrower or any other
         Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on
         account of any such Tax from any sum paid or payable by Borrowers to
         Administrative Agent or any Lender under any of the Credit Documents:

                           (a)      Borrowers shall notify Administrative Agent
                  of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement
                  as soon as Borrowers become aware of it (it being understood
                  and agreed that no such notice shall be required with respect
                  to Canadian Lenders, if any);

                           (b)      Borrowers shall pay any such Tax when such
                  Tax is due, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay
                  is imposed on any Borrower) for their

                                       42
<PAGE>

                  own account or (if that liability is imposed on Administrative
                  Agent or such Lender, as the case may be) on behalf of and in
                  the name of Administrative Agent or such Lender;

                           (c)      the sum payable by Borrowers in respect of
                  which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is
                  required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure
                  that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or
                  payment, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may
                  be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would
                  have received had no such deduction, withholding or payment
                  been required or made; and

                           (d)      within 30 days after paying any sum from
                  which any or all of them are required by law to make any
                  deduction or withholding, and within 30 days after the due
                  date of payment of any Tax which any or all of them are
                  required by clause (b) above to pay, Borrowers shall deliver
                  to Administrative Agent evidence satisfactory to the other
                  affected parties of such deduction, withholding or payment and
                  of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other
                  authority.

                  (iii)    Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax.

                           (a)      Each Lender that is organized under the laws
                  of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state
                  or other political subdivision thereof (for purposes of this
                  subsection 2.4B(iii), a "NON-US LENDER") shall (1) to the
                  extent such Non-US Lender is not a Canadian Lender, deliver to
                  Administrative Agent and to Company, on or prior to the
                  Closing Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the
                  signature pages hereof) or on or prior to the date of the
                  Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in
                  the case of each other Lender), and at such other times as may
                  be necessary in the determination of Company or Administrative
                  Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), two
                  original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
                  W-8ECI (or any successor forms) properly completed and duly
                  executed by such Lender, together with any other certificate
                  or statement of exemption required under the Internal Revenue
                  Code or the regulations issued thereunder to establish that
                  such Lender is not subject to United States withholding tax
                  with respect to any payments to such Lender of interest
                  payable under any of the Credit Documents, and (2) to the
                  extent such Non-US Lender is a Canadian Lender, deliver to
                  Administrative Agent and to Company, on or prior to the
                  Closing Date (in the case of each Canadian Lender listed on
                  the signature pages hereof) or on or prior to the date of the
                  Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Canadian
                  Lender (in the case of each other Canadian Lender), and at
                  such other times as may be necessary in the determination of
                  Company or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable
                  exercise of its discretion), two original copies of any forms,
                  properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, required
                  under the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations issued
                  thereunder to establish that such Canadian Lender is eligible
                  for a reduced withholding tax rate under the "Convention
                  Between the United States of America and Canada with Respect
                  to Taxes on Income and Capital" or any successor thereto.

<PAGE>

                           (b)      Each Non-US Lender hereby agrees, from time
                  to time after the initial delivery by such Lender of such
                  forms, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances
                  renders such forms, certificates or other evidence so
                  delivered obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that
                  such Lender shall promptly (1) deliver to Administrative Agent
                  and to Company two original copies of renewals, amendments or
                  additional or successor forms, properly completed and duly
                  executed by such Lender, together with any other certificate
                  or statement of exemption required in order to confirm or
                  establish that such Lender is not subject to United States
                  withholding tax with respect to payments to such Lender under
                  the Credit Documents (or, if such Lender is a Canadian Lender,
                  to confirm or establish that such Lender is eligible for the
                  relevant reduced withholding tax rate) or (2) notify
                  Administrative Agent and Company of its inability to deliver
                  any such forms, certificates or other evidence.

                           (c)      Borrowers shall not be required to pay any
                  additional amount to any Non-US Lender under clause (c) of
                  subsection 2.4B(ii) if such Lender shall have failed to
                  satisfy the requirements of clause (a) or (b)(1) of this
                  subsection 2.4B(iii); provided that if such Lender shall have
                  satisfied the requirements of subsection 2.4B(iii)(a) on the
                  date such Lender became a Lender, nothing in this subsection
                  2.4B(iii)(c) shall relieve Borrowers of their obligation to
                  pay any amounts pursuant to subsection 2.4B(ii)(c) in the
                  event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law,
                  treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any
                  change in the interpretation, administration or application
                  thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver
                  forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date
                  establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject to
                  withholding as described in subsection 2.4B(iii)(a) (or, if
                  such Lender is a Canadian Lender, establishing the fact that
                  such Lender is eligible for the relevant reduced withholding
                  tax rate).

                           (d)      Notwithstanding anything contained in this
                  subsection to the contrary, Borrowers shall be required to pay
                  additional amounts to each Canadian Lender under clause (c) of
                  subsection 2.4B(ii) with respect to any Credit Exposure held
                  by such Canadian Lender in its capacity as a Canadian Lender
                  notwithstanding that such Lender fails to deliver forms,
                  certificates or other evidence establishing the fact that such
                  Lender is not subject to withholding as described in
                  subsection 2.4B(iii)(a)(1).

                  (iv)     Indemnity for Withheld Amounts. Borrowers hereby
         agree to indemnify Lenders and Agents for the full amount of any
         deduction or withholding on account of any Taxes imposed, levied,
         collected, withheld or assessed by or within the United States or any
         political subdivision in or of the United States or any other
         jurisdiction from or to which a payment is made by or on behalf of
         Borrowers or by any federation or organization of which the United
         States or any such jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment
         (including any such Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
         payable under this subsection 2.4B) that Borrowers are required to pay
         pursuant to subsection 2.4B(ii) but were paid by Agents or Lenders with
         respect to sums payable by Borrowers under this Agreement and the other
         Credit Documents and any liability

                                       44
<PAGE>

         (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
         respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made promptly, and in
         any event within 10 days after, the relevant Lender or Agent makes
         demand therefor in writing.

                  C.       CAPITAL ADEQUACY ADJUSTMENT. If any Lender shall have
determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after the
date hereof of any law, rule or regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding
capital adequacy, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Government Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any
guideline, request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such Government Authority, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to,
such Lender's Letter of Credit Commitments, Letters of Credit, participations
therein or other Obligations to a level below that which such Lender or such
controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption,
effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or compliance (taking into
consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with
regard to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within five Business Days
after receipt by Borrowers from such Lender of the statement referred to in
subsection 2.5A, Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation on an
after-tax basis for such reduction.

         2.5      STATEMENT OF LENDERS; OBLIGATION OF LENDERS AND ISSUING
                  LENDERS TO MITIGATE.

                  A.       STATEMENTS. Each Lender claiming compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to subsection 2.4 or 2.5B shall deliver to Company (with
a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis of the calculation of such compensation or reimbursement, which
statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent
manifest error; provided that a Lender claiming compensation or reimbursement
pursuant to subsection 2.4B(ii) due to circumstances in effect as of the Closing
Date shall not be required to deliver more than one such statement to Borrowers
or Administrative Agent, and such statement shall remain effective with respect
to this Agreement until all Obligations have been paid in full.

                  B.       MITIGATION. Each Lender (including any Issuing
Lender) agrees that, as promptly as practicable after the officer of such Lender
or Issuing Lender responsible for administering the Letters of Credit of such
Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, becomes aware of the occurrence of
an event or the existence of a condition that would entitle such Lender or
Issuing Lender to receive payments under subsection 2.4 (other than subsection
2.4B(ii)), it will use reasonable efforts to make, issue, fund or maintain the
Letter of Credit Commitments of such Lender or the Letters of Credit of such
Lender or Issuing Lender through another lending or letter of credit office of
such Lender or Issuing Lender, if (i) as a result thereof the additional amounts
which would otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender or Issuing Lender
pursuant to subsection 2.4 would be materially reduced and (ii) as determined by
such Lender or Issuing Lender in its sole discretion, such action would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or Issuing Lender; provided that
such Lender or Issuing Lender will not be obligated to utilize such other
lending or letter of credit office

                                       45
<PAGE>

pursuant to this subsection 2.5B unless Borrowers agree to pay, on a joint and
several basis, all incremental expenses incurred by such Lender or Issuing
Lender as a result of utilizing such other lending or letter of credit office as
described above.

         2.6      DEFAULTING LENDER.

                  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in
the event that any Lender (any such Lender being a "DEFAULTING LENDER") defaults
(a "FUNDING DEFAULT") in its obligation to fund its participation in any Letter
of Credit (a "DEFAULTED PARTICIPATION") in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or defaults in its obligation to comply with the agreements contained
in subsection 10.1H, then (i) during any Default Period (as defined below) with
respect to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed a
"Lender" for purposes of voting on any matters (including the granting of any
consents or waivers) with respect to any of the Credit Documents (provided,
however, that nothing in this clause (i) shall be construed as permitting,
without the consent of the relevant Defaulting Lender, a reduction in the
principal amount of such Defaulting Lender's outstanding funded Obligations, an
increase in the amount of such Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment or
participation in any Letters of Credit, a reduction or postponement of the due
date of any amount funded by such Defaulting Lender and payable in respect of
any Letter of Credit, an extension of the expiration date of any Letter of
Credit beyond the Maturity Date, or an extension of the Maturity Date), (ii)
solely in the case of a Funding Default, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, until such time as the Default Excess (as defined below) with respect to
such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero, any payment or
reimbursement of amounts with respect to a drawing under a Letter of Credit
shall be applied first, to amounts funded by Agents, Issuing Lenders or other
Lenders (together with unpaid interest accrued thereon) in lieu of such amounts
required to be funded by Defaulting Lenders and second, to the Letter of Credit
participations of other Lenders (other than any other Defaulting Lenders) as if
such Defaulting Lender (and any other Defaulting Lenders) had no participations
outstanding and the Letter of Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender were
zero, (iii) except to the extent that the immediately preceding clause (ii)
applies, during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender any
payment or reimbursement of amounts funded by such Defaulting Lender with
respect to a drawing under a Letter of Credit shall be applied first, to cash
collateralize, to the full extent thereof, the maximum amount of the Letter of
Credit Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to documentation and
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and Issuing
Lenders, second, to reimburse fees and expenses of the type described in the
last sentence of subsection 10.1H in connection with such cash
collateralization, and third, to reimburse amounts funded by such Defaulting
Lender with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, and (iv) such
Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment and Pro Rata Share with respect
thereto shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the letter of credit fees
under subsection 3.2 in respect of any day during any Default Period with
respect to such Defaulting Lender, and such Defaulting Lender shall not be
entitled to receive any such letter of credit fee with respect to such
Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Commitments in respect of any Default
Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender.

                  For purposes of this Agreement, (I) "DEFAULT PERIOD" means (i)
with respect to any default in any Defaulting Lender's obligations under
subsection 10.1H, the period commencing on the date of the applicable default in
such obligations and ending on the earliest

                                       46
<PAGE>

of the following dates: (A) the date on which all Letter of Credit Commitments
and participations are cancelled or terminated and/or the Obligations are paid
in full and all Letters of Credit have been returned to the Issuing Lenders
cancelled, (B) the date on which such Defaulting Lender shall have complied with
its obligations under subsection 10.1H, and (C) the date on which Administrative
Agent and all Issuing Lenders waive all such defaults of such Defaulting Lender
in writing; and (ii) with respect to any Funding Default of any Defaulting
Lender, the period commencing on the date of the applicable Funding Default and
ending on the earliest of the following dates: (A) the date on which all Letter
of Credit Commitments and participations are cancelled or terminated and/or the
Obligations are paid in full and all Letters of Credit have been returned to the
Issuing Lenders cancelled, (B) the date on which (1) the Default Excess with
respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero (whether by
the funding by such Defaulting Lender of any Defaulted Participations of such
Defaulting Lender or by the non-pro rata application of any payments of amounts
with respect to any payments or reimbursements of amounts with respect to
drawings under Letters of Credit in accordance with the terms hereof or any
combination thereof), and (2) such Defaulting Lender shall have delivered to
Company and Agents a written reaffirmation of its intention to honor its
obligations under this Agreement with respect to its Letter of Credit
Commitments, and (C) the date on which Company, Administrative Agent and all
Issuing Lenders waive all Funding Defaults of such Defaulting Lender in writing,
and (II) "DEFAULT EXCESS" means, with respect to any Defaulting Lender, the
excess, if any, of (x) such Defaulting Lender's applicable Pro Rata Share of all
funded participations in Letters of Credit (calculated as if all Defaulting
Lenders (other than such Defaulting Lender) had funded all of their respective
Defaulted Participations) over (y) the aggregate funded amount of such
Defaulting Lender's participations in Letters of Credit.

                  No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise
affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this subsection 2.6,
performance by any Borrower of its obligations under this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents shall not be excused or otherwise modified, as a result
of any Funding Default or the operation of this subsection 2.6. The rights and
remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this subsection 2.6 are in addition
to other rights and remedies that Borrowers may have against such Defaulting
Lender with respect to any Funding Default and that Agents, any Issuing Lender
or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any
Funding Default.

         2.7      JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY; PAYMENT INDEMNIFICATIONS.

                  A.       JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS. All Obligations of
Borrowers under the Credit Documents shall be the joint and several Obligations
of each Borrower.

                  B.       NO IMPAIRMENT OR RELEASE. The Obligations of and the
Liens granted by any Borrower under the Credit Documents shall not be impaired
or released by any action or inaction on the part of Administrative Agent or any
Lender with respect to any other Credit Party, including any action or inaction
which would otherwise release a surety.

                  C.       CONTRIBUTION RIGHTS. In order to provide for just and
equitable contribution among Borrowers if any payment is made by a Borrower (a
"FUNDING BORROWER") in discharging any of the Obligations, that Funding Borrower
shall be entitled to a contribution from the other Borrowers for all payments,
damages and expenses incurred by that Funding

                                       47
<PAGE>

Borrower in discharging the Obligations, in the manner and to the extent
required to allocate liabilities in an equitable manner among Borrowers on the
basis of the relative benefits received by Borrowers. If and to the extent that
a Funding Borrower makes any payment to any Lender or any other Person in
respect of the Obligations, any claim which said Funding Borrower may have
against the other Borrowers by reason thereof shall be subject and subordinate
to the prior cash payment in full of the Obligations. The parties hereto
acknowledge that the right to contribution hereunder shall constitute an asset
of the party to which such contribution is owing and shall be subject to the
Liens and security interests of the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing to the contrary, such contribution arrangements shall not limit in
any manner the joint and several nature of the Obligations, limit, release or
otherwise impair any rights of Administrative Agent or any Lender under the
Credit Documents, or alter, limit or impair the obligation of each Borrower,
which is absolute and unconditional, to repay the Obligations.

         2.8      RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION, CONTRIBUTION, ETC.

                  Except as prohibited under applicable law, Company hereby
waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that Company now has or
may hereafter have against any other Borrower or any guarantor of the
Obligations in connection with this Agreement or the performance by Company of
its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy
arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and
including (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that
Company now has or may hereafter have against any other Borrower or guarantor of
the Obligations, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim,
right or remedy that any Agent or Lender now has or may hereafter have against
any other Borrower or guarantor of the Obligations, and (c) any benefit of, and
any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by
any Agent or Lender. In addition, until the Obligations shall have been
indefeasibly paid in full and the Letter of Credit Commitments shall have
terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled,
Company shall withhold exercise of any right of contribution Company may have
against any other Borrower or Credit Party. Company further agrees that, to the
extent the waiver or agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of
subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any
reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification Company may
have against any other Borrower or Credit Party or against any collateral or
security shall be junior and subordinate to any rights any Agent or Lender may
have against any other Borrower, to all right, title and interest any Agent or
Lender may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right any Agent
or Lender may have against such Credit Party. If any amount shall be paid to
Company on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or
contribution rights at any time when all Obligations shall not have been paid in
full, such amount shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of
Agents and Lenders and shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for
the benefit of Agents and Lenders to be credited and applied against the
Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof.

SECTION 3.        LETTERS OF CREDIT

         3.1      ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND LENDERS' PURCHASE OF
                  PARTICIPATIONS THEREIN.

                  A.       INITIAL ISSUANCE. In the event that UBS Bank executes
and delivers a counterpart of this Agreement as Issuing Lender on or prior to
the Closing Date, UBS Bank shall, on the Closing Date upon receiving evidence
satisfactory to it that the Existing Detroit L/Cs are concurrently therewith
being returned undrawn and cancelled, issue a Letter of Credit or Letters of
Credit in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit IV to replace the
Existing Detroit L/Cs. In the event that UBS Bank does not execute and deliver a
counterpart of this Agreement as Issuing Lender on or prior to the Closing Date,
Bank of America shall, on the Closing Date upon receiving evidence satisfactory
to it that the Existing Detroit L/Cs are concurrently therewith being returned
undrawn and cancelled, issue a Letter of Credit or Letters of Credit in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit IV to replace the Existing
Detroit L/Cs.

                  B.       MECHANICS OF ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES.

                  (i)      Request for Issuance of Letters of Credit. After the
         issuance of any Letter of Credit on the Closing Date pursuant to
         subsection 3.1A, whenever Borrowers desire to have the Issuing Lender
         issue a Letter of Credit to extend or replace such outstanding Letter
         of Credit, or Agents request (with a copy of such request to Company)
         that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit to extend or to
         replace such outstanding Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall deliver to
         Administrative Agent a Request for Issuance no later than 12:00 Noon
         (New York City time) at least 10 Business Days (or in each case such
         shorter period as may be agreed to by Administrative Agent in any
         particular instance) in advance of the proposed date of issuance, which
         Request for Issuance shall describe the relevant Letter of Credit and
         the verbatim text of the Letter of Credit proposed to be issued or of
         such extension, as the case may be, and shall specify such proposed
         date of issuance or extension; provided, that Borrowers shall not
         request that Issuing Lender issue or extend (and Issuing Lender shall
         not issue or extend) any Letter of Credit:

                           (a)      if the underlying Contractual Obligation to
                  provide any such Letter of Credit or a replacement thereto to
                  the beneficiary thereof has terminated, and/or the beneficiary
                  of such Letter of Credit has otherwise returned the same for
                  cancellation without the expectation that a Letter of Credit
                  will be issued contemporaneously with such cancellation in
                  substitution therefor;

                           (b)      unless the terms of such Letter of Credit as
                  so replaced or extended (other than the stated amount and
                  expiration date thereof) are substantially identical to the
                  terms of the corresponding Letter of Credit being replaced or
                  extended;

                           (c)      unless the stated amount of such Letter of
                  Credit as so replaced or extended is identical to the stated
                  amount of the corresponding Letter of Credit being replaced or
                  extended, as the case may be, in effect at the time of such

                                       49
<PAGE>

                  extension (and the formula in effect on the Closing Date for
                  calculating required reductions in the stated amount of any
                  Letter of Credit shall apply to such Letter of Credit as so
                  replaced or extended), and is denominated in Dollars;

                           (d)      if such Letter of Credit as so replaced or
                  extended has an expiration date later than the earlier of (y)
                  the 5th Business Day prior to the Maturity Date and (z) the
                  date which is three years from the date of issuance of such
                  Letter of Credit; or

                           (e)      if, after giving effect to such issuance or
                  extension, the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Letter
                  of Credit Commitments.

                  (ii)     Recertification. Borrowers shall notify the Issuing
         Lender (and Administrative Agent, if Administrative Agent is not such
         Issuing Lender) prior to the issuance or extension of any Letter of
         Credit in the event that any of the matters to which Borrowers are
         required to certify in the relevant Request for Issuance is no longer
         true and correct as of the proposed date of issuance or extension of
         such Letter of Credit (provided that no Request for Issuance shall
         require Borrowers to make representations or warranties other than
         those referenced in subsection 3.1B(iii)(b)), and upon the issuance or
         extension of such Letter of Credit Borrowers shall be deemed to have
         re-certified, as of the date of such issuance or extension, as to the
         matters to which Borrowers are required to certify in such Request for
         Issuance (except to the extent such requirement to re-certify as to
         such matters shall have been waived in accordance with subsection 10.6
         hereof).

                  (iii)    Issuance of Letter of Credit. Subject to subsections
         3.1B(i) and 3.1B(ii), unless the Maturity Date shall have occurred,
         upon satisfaction or waiver (in accordance with subsection 10.6) of the
         following conditions on the date of issuance or extension, the
         applicable Issuing Lender shall issue the requested Letter of Credit
         (in the form set forth in such notice) to replace (or shall extend, as
         the case may be) the relevant outstanding Letter of Credit, in
         accordance with such Issuing Lender's standard operating procedures:

                           (a)      On or before the date of issuance or
                  extension of such Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent shall
                  have received, in accordance with the provisions of subsection
                  3.1B(i), an originally executed Request for Issuance (or a
                  facsimile copy thereof), signed by a duly authorized Officer
                  of Borrowers, together with all other information specified in
                  subsection 3.1B(i) and such other documents or information as
                  Issuing Lender may reasonably require in connection with the
                  issuance or extension of such Letter of Credit;

                           (b)      The representations and warranties contained
                  in subsections 5.1, 5.2, 5.15, 5.16 and 5.18 shall be true,
                  correct and complete in all material respects on and as of the
                  date of issuance or extension of such Letter of Credit to the
                  same extent as though made on and as of that date, except to
                  the extent such representations and warranties specifically
                  relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations
                  and warranties shall have been true, correct and complete in
                  all material respects on and as of such earlier date; and

                                       50
<PAGE>

                           (c)      No event shall have occurred and be
                  continuing or would result from the issuance or extension of
                  such Letter of Credit that would constitute an Event of
                  Default or a Potential Event of Default.

                  (iv)     Notification to Lenders. No later than 10 Business
         Days prior to the decision to extend or reissue any Letter of Credit,
         the Issuing Lender thereof shall notify Agents in writing of the date
         on which such Issuing Lender expects such decision will be made and of
         the date by which such decision must be made in order to avoid a
         drawing under such Letter of Credit. Promptly after the issuance,
         amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit the applicable Issuing
         Lender shall promptly notify Administrative Agent and each Lender of
         such issuance, amendment or extension in writing. Upon receipt of such
         notice (or, if Administrative Agent is the Issuing Lender, together
         with such notice), Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender in
         writing of the amount of such Lender's respective participation in such
         Letter of Credit, determined in accordance with subsection 3.1C and, if
         so requested by a Lender, Administrative Agent shall provide such
         Lender with a copy of such Letter of Credit, amendment or extension.

                  C.       LENDERS' PURCHASE OF PARTICIPATIONS IN LETTERS OF
CREDIT. Immediately upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit (including any
issuance of a Letter of Credit pursuant to subsection 3.1A), each Lender shall
be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have irrevocably purchased from the Issuing
Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and any drawings honored
thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the maximum
amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn thereunder. Each
Borrower, with respect to the Existing Detroit L/Cs and the Letters of Credit,
hereby (1) represents, warrants, agrees, covenants and reaffirms that it has no
(and it permanently and irrevocably waives and releases Agents and Lenders from
any, to the extent arising on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to the
Existing Detroit L/Cs) defense, set off, claim or counterclaim against Agents or
any Lender in regard to its obligations in respect of any such participation in
a Letter of Credit or any drawings honored thereunder, and (2) affirms its
obligation to pay such participations, and any amounts owed (whether or not then
due and payable, and including all interest and fees accrued under the DIP
Credit Documents to the Closing Date with respect to the Existing Detroit L/Cs)
with respect to each Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

         3.2      LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

                  Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay the following
amounts with respect to each Letter of Credit:

                  (i)      a fronting fee, payable directly to the applicable
         Issuing Lender for its own account, equal to (a) the greater of (X)
         $500 and (Y) 0.25% per annum of the daily amount available to be drawn
         under such Letter of Credit, plus (b) an annual fee of $1,500, and

                  (ii)     a letter of credit fee, payable to Administrative
         Agent for the account of Lenders, equal to 2.50% per annum (expressed
         as a daily rate) multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn
         under such Letter of Credit,

                                       51
<PAGE>

each such fronting fee and letter of credit fee to be payable in arrears on and
to (but excluding) the last day of each month and computed on the basis of a
360-day year, for the actual number of days elapsed, except that the annual fee
referred to in clause (i)(b) shall be payable in advance on the date of issuance
of such Letter of Credit and on each anniversary thereof; and with respect to
the issuance, amendment or transfer of each Letter of Credit and each payment of
a drawing made thereunder (without duplication of the fees payable under clauses
(i) and (ii) above), Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay documentary
and processing charges payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its
own account in accordance with such Issuing Lender's standard schedule for such
charges in effect at the time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment,
as the case may be.

                  For purposes of calculating any fees payable under this
subsection 3.2, the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of
Credit shall be determined as of the close of business on any date of
determination. Promptly upon receipt by Administrative Agent of any amount
described in clause (ii) of this subsection 3.2 with respect to a Letter of
Credit, Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share
of such amount. All fees referenced in this subsection 3.2 shall be earned when
payable and shall be non-refundable. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of any Event of Default, all fees set forth in this subsection 3.2
shall accrue at a rate that is 2.00% per annum in excess of the rate otherwise
set forth in this subsection and shall, if Requisite Lenders so request, be
payable upon demand. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates provided for
in this paragraph shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or
otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or
any Lender.

         3.3      DRAWINGS AND REIMBURSEMENT OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF
                  CREDIT.

                  A.       RESPONSIBILITY OF ISSUING LENDER WITH RESPECT TO
DRAWINGS. In determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit
by the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to
examine the documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care
so as to ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in compliance with
the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

                  B.       REIMBURSEMENT OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF
CREDIT. In the event an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing under a
Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall immediately notify
Borrowers and Borrowers shall reimburse such Issuing Lender on or before the
Business Day immediately following the date on which such drawing is honored
(the "REIMBURSEMENT DATE") in an amount in Dollars and in same day funds equal
to the amount of such payment.

                  C.       PAYMENT BY LENDERS OF UNREIMBURSED AMOUNTS PAID UNDER
LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (i)      Payment by Lenders. In the event that Borrowers shall
         fail for any reason to reimburse any Issuing Lender as provided in
         subsection 3.3B in an amount equal to the amount of any payment by such
         Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing
         Lender shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of the unreimbursed
         amount of such drawing and upon receipt of such notice, Administrative
         Agent shall promptly

                                       52
<PAGE>

         notify each Lender (other than such Issuing Lender) of such
         unreimbursed amount and of such Lender's respective participation
         therein based on such Lender's Pro Rata Share; provided that no
         Lender's funding of its participation in any such drawing shall exceed
         its Pro Rata Share of the amount of such drawing, and the aggregate
         principal amount of all participations funded by a Lender with respect
         to Letters of Credit shall in no event exceed the amount of such
         Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment. Each Lender shall make available
         to such Issuing Lender an amount equal to its respective participation,
         in Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of such Issuing Lender
         specified in such notice, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City
         time) on the first Business Day (under the laws of the jurisdiction in
         which such office of such Issuing Lender is located) after the date
         notified by Administrative Agent. In the event that any Lender fails to
         make available to such Issuing Lender on such Business Day the amount
         of such Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in
         this subsection 3.3C, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover
         such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon
         at the rate customarily used by such Issuing Lender for the correction
         of errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the
         Base Rate. Nothing in this subsection 3.3C shall be deemed to prejudice
         the right of any Lender to recover from any Issuing Lender any amounts
         made available by such Lender to such Issuing Lender pursuant to this
         subsection 3.3C in the event that it is determined by the final
         judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with
         respect to a Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender in respect of
         which payment was made by such Lender constituted gross negligence or
         willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender.

                  (ii)     Distribution to Lenders of Reimbursements Received
         From Borrowers. In the event any Issuing Lender shall have been
         reimbursed by other Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or
         any portion of any payment by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of
         Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall deliver to
         Administrative Agent for distribution to any other Lender that has paid
         all amounts payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such
         payment such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments subsequently
         received by such Issuing Lender from Borrowers in reimbursement of such
         payment under the Letter of Credit when such payments are received. Any
         such distribution shall be made to a Lender at its primary address set
         forth below its name on the appropriate signature page hereof or at
         such other address as such Lender may request.

                  D.       INTEREST ON AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (i)      Payment of Interest by Borrowers. Borrowers agree to
         pay to each Issuing Lender, with respect to payments under any Letters
         of Credit issued by it, interest on the amount paid by such Issuing
         Lender in respect of each such payment from the date a drawing is
         honored to but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by
         Borrowers at a rate equal to (1) for the period from the date such
         drawing is honored to but excluding the Reimbursement Date, the Base
         Rate plus 3.00% per annum and (2) thereafter, a rate which is 2% per
         annum in excess of the rate of interest set forth in the foregoing
         clause (i)(1). Interest payable pursuant to this subsection 3.3D(i)
         shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year, as the
         case may be, for the actual number of days

                                       53
<PAGE>

         elapsed in the period during which it accrues and shall be payable on
         demand or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related
         drawing under a Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full. All payments by
         Borrowers in respect of payments made by an Issuing Lender under a
         Letter of Credit issued by it shall include payment of accrued interest
         on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments
         shall be applied to the payment of interest before application to
         principal. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest
         provided for in this subsection 3.3D is not a permitted alternative to
         timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of
         Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of
         Administrative Agent or any Lender.

                  (ii)     Distribution of Interest Payments by Issuing Lender.
         Promptly upon receipt by any Issuing Lender of any payment of interest
         pursuant to subsection 3.3D(i) with respect to a payment under a Letter
         of Credit issued by it, (a) such Issuing Lender shall distribute to
         Administrative Agent for distribution to each other Lender, out of the
         interest received by such Issuing Lender in respect of the period from
         the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date on which
         such Issuing Lender is reimbursed for the amount of such payment, the
         amount that such other Lender would have been entitled to receive in
         respect of the letter of credit fee that would have been payable in
         respect of such Letter of Credit for such period pursuant to subsection
         3.2 if no drawing had been honored under such Letter of Credit, and (b)
         in the event such Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by other
         Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any portion of such
         payment, such Issuing Lender shall distribute to Administrative Agent
         for distribution to each other Lender that has paid all amounts payable
         by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such payment such other
         Lender's Pro Rata Share of any interest received by such Issuing Lender
         in respect of that portion of such payment so reimbursed by other
         Lenders for the period from the date on which such Issuing Lender was
         so reimbursed by other Lenders to but excluding the date on which such
         portion of such payment is reimbursed by Borrowers. Any such
         distribution shall be made to a Lender at its primary address set forth
         below its name on the appropriate signature page hereof or at such
         other address as such Lender may request.

         3.4      OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE.

                  The obligation of Borrowers to reimburse each Issuing Lender
for payments under the Letters of Credit issued by it and the obligations of
Lenders under subsection 3.3C(i) shall be unconditional and irrevocable and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances including any of the following circumstances:

                  (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter
         of Credit;

                  (ii)     the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
         right which any Borrower or any Lender may have at any time against a
         beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons
         for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Lender or
         other Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a Lender, against
         any Borrower, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
         transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction
         (including any underlying transaction between any

                                       54
<PAGE>

         Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for which any
         Letter of Credit was procured);

                  (iii)    any draft or other document presented under any
         Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;

                  (iv)     payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under any
         Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document
         which does not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of
         Credit;

                  (v)      any adverse change in the business, operations,
         properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries);

                  (vi)     any breach of this Agreement or any other Credit
         Document by any party thereto;

                  (vii)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; or

                  (viii)   the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential
         Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

provided, in each case, that payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under the
applicable Letter of Credit shall not have constituted gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender under the circumstances in question
(as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

         3.5      NATURE OF ISSUING LENDERS' DUTIES.

                  A.       INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to amounts payable as
provided in subsection 2.4, Borrowers hereby jointly and severally agree to
protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless each Issuing Lender from and against
any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and
expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of outside
counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which such Issuing Lender may
incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance
of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender, other than as a result of (a)
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender as determined
by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (b) subject to the
following clause (ii), the wrongful dishonor by such Issuing Lender of a proper
demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit issued by it or (ii) the
failure of such Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under any such Letter of
Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any
present or future de jure or de facto Government Authority.

                  B.       NATURE OF ISSUING LENDERS' DUTIES. As between
Borrowers and any Issuing Lender, Borrowers assume all risks of the acts and
omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender
by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.

                                       55
<PAGE>

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Lender shall
not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection
with the application for and issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it
should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any
instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any
such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof,
in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any
reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply
fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit;
(iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of
any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they
be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or
delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make
a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the
misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds
of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising
from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Lender, including any act or
omission by a Government Authority specified in subsection 3.5A, and none of the
above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of such Issuing
Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

                  In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specific provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 3.5B,
any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with
the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered
thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender
under any resulting liability to any Borrower.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
subsection 3.5, Borrowers shall retain any and all rights they may have against
any Issuing Lender for any liability arising solely out of the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender, as determined by a final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

         3.6      CASH COLLATERAL FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  A.       RELEASES OF CASH COLLATERAL. If (i) (a) the
underlying Contractual Obligation to provide a Letter of Credit or a replacement
thereto to the beneficiary thereof has terminated (other than by drawing under
such Letter of Credit), and/or (b) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit has
otherwise returned the same for cancellation without the expectation that a
Letter of Credit will be issued contemporaneously with such cancellation in
substitution for such cancelled Letter of Credit, and/or the maximum amount
available for drawing under a Letter of Credit is permanently reduced (other
than such a reduction concurrently with a reissuance or replacement of the
relevant reduced portion of such Letter of Credit pursuant to subsection
3.1B(iii)), and (ii) the Letter of Credit Commitments are permanently reduced by
the amount of such Letter of Credit or such reduction in the stated amount of
such Letter of Credit, as the case may be, then, to the extent that the amount
of cash collateral securing the Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to the
Collateral Account Agreement exceeds 105% of the Letter of Credit Commitments
then in effect after such permanent reduction, the excess cash collateral shall
be applied to the payment to or upon the order of Borrowers or to whosoever may
be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction
may direct, except to

                                       56
<PAGE>

the extent the Intercreditor Agreement requires application in a different
manner than as set forth in this subsection 3.6.

                  B.       CASH COLLATERAL ON THE MATURITY DATE. On the Maturity
Date, any outstanding Letter of Credit Exposure shall be cash collateralized in
an amount equal to 105% of the amount thereof by Borrowers or otherwise
supported, in either case in a manner satisfactory to the Lenders.

action, suit, investigation, litigation or proceeding pending or threatened in
any court or before any arbitrator or governmental instrumentality that purports

Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the Approved Plan of
Reorganization, any of the Credit Documents or any of the CPIH Term Loan

                  W.       COMPLETION OF PROCEEDINGS. All corporate and other
proceedings taken or to be taken in connection with the transactions

                  X.       LENDER REQUIREMENTS. Each Person that is a Lender on
the Closing Date (each such Lender being a "CLOSING DATE LENDER"), at its own
expense, either (i) shall have provided Issuing Lenders with evidence
satisfactory to Issuing Lenders that such Closing Date Lender has long term

consented to, approved and be satisfied with, the documents, agreements,
instruments or information which require approval, consent or satisfaction of

Persons after the Closing Date, (b) failure to deliver all of the certificates
or other evidence of good standing described in subsection 4.1A(i) on or prior
to the date which is 90 days after the Closing Date shall constitute an

to pay franchise taxes full payment of which has been tendered by such date), or
(ii) failure to deliver all or any portion of the title insurance-related
documents and instruments described in subsection 4.1N with respect to the Real
Property Asset located in Lassen County, California, provided, that failure to
deliver all of such documents and instruments with respect to such property on

SECTION 5.        COMPANY'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  In order to induce Lenders to enter into this Agreement, to
induce Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit and to induce Lenders to
purchase participations therein, Company represents and warrants to each Lender,
on the date of this Agreement, on the Closing Date and (in the case of the
representations and warranties referenced in subsection 3.1B(iii)(b)) on the
date of issuance of a replacement or extension of any Letter of Credit, that the
following statements are true, correct and complete:

                  5.1      ORGANIZATION, POWERS, QUALIFICATION, GOOD STANDING,
                           BUSINESS AND SUBSIDIARIES.

                  A.       ORGANIZATION AND POWERS. Each Credit Party is a
corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization as specified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto (provided, however,
that failure of any Credit Party to be in good standing in the relevant
jurisdiction shall not be deemed a breach of this representation if (x) such
failure is due solely to failure to pay franchise taxes and (y) full payment of
such franchise taxes has been tendered no later than the date which is 90 days
after the Closing Date). Each Credit Party has all requisite

                                       68
<PAGE>

power and authority to own and operate its properties, to carry on its business
as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Credit
Documents to which it is a party and to carry out the transactions contemplated
thereby. Each Credit Party is in compliance with all material terms of its
Organizational Documents.

                  B.       QUALIFICATION AND GOOD STANDING. Each Credit Party is
qualified to do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction necessary to
carry out its business and operations, except in jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  C.       CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. Company and its Subsidiaries are
engaged only in the businesses permitted to be engaged in pursuant to subsection
7.12.

                  D.       SUBSIDIARIES. All of the Subsidiaries of Company as
of the Closing Date and their jurisdictions of organization are identified in
Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto. The Capital Stock of each of the Subsidiaries of
Company identified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and none of such Capital Stock constitutes
Margin Stock. Each of the Subsidiaries of Company identified in Schedule 5.1
annexed hereto is a corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization set forth therein, has all requisite
power and authority to own and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and is qualified to
do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction necessary to carry out
its business and operations, in each case except where failure to be so
qualified or in good standing or a lack of such power and authority has not had
and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule
5.1 annexed hereto correctly sets forth, as of the Closing Date, the ownership
interest of Company and each of its Subsidiaries in each of the Subsidiaries of
Company identified therein.

         5.2      AUTHORIZATION OF BORROWING, ETC.

                  A.       AUTHORIZATION OF BORROWING. The execution, delivery
and performance of the Credit Documents have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of each Credit Party that is a party thereto.

                  B.       NO CONFLICT. The execution, delivery and performance
by Credit Parties of the Credit Documents to which they are parties and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do not and
will not (i) violate any provision of any law or any governmental rule or
regulation applicable to Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Organizational
Documents of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any order, judgment or decree
of any court or other Government Authority binding on Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any Contractual Obligation of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) result in or require the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, other than any Liens created under any of the Credit Documents
in favor of Collateral Agent on behalf of Secured Parties, or (iv) require any
approval of stockholders or any approval or consent of any Person under any
Contractual Obligation of

                                       69
<PAGE>

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for (x) such approvals or consents
which will be obtained on or before the Closing Date and disclosed in writing to
Lenders.

                  C.       GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. The execution, delivery and
performance by Credit Parties of the Credit Documents to which they are parties
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do
not and will not require any Governmental Authorization, except for the entry of
the Confirmation Order and except for filings expressly contemplated by the
Credit Documents and those Governmental Authorizations which have been obtained.

                  D.       BINDING OBLIGATION. Each of the Credit Documents has
been duly executed and delivered by each Credit Party that is a party thereto
and is the legally valid and binding obligation of such Credit Party,
enforceable against such Credit Party in accordance with its respective terms,
except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally or by
equitable principles relating to enforceability.

                  E.       RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER. There are no restrictions
on any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which prohibit or otherwise restrict
the transfer of cash or other assets from one to another, other than (i)
prohibitions or restrictions existing under or by reason of (a) this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents, (b) applicable law, (c) customary non-assignment
provisions entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practices, and (d) any documents or instruments governing the terms of any
Indebtedness or other obligations secured by Liens permitted by subsection 7.2A,
provided that such prohibitions or restrictions apply only to the assets subject
to such Liens, and (ii) restrictions described in clauses (a) through (d) of
subsection 7.2D.

         5.3      FINANCIAL CONDITION.

                  Company has heretofore delivered to Lenders, at Lenders'
request, (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of Company and its
Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2002 and (ii) the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of Company and its Subsidiaries for the Fiscal
Quarters ended March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003. All such
statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP and fairly present, in all
material respects, the financial position (on a consolidated and, where
applicable, consolidating basis) of the entities described in such financial
statements as at the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows (on a consolidated and, where applicable, consolidating basis) of the
entities described therein for each of the periods then ended, subject, in the
case of any such unaudited financial statements, to changes resulting from audit
and normal year-end adjustments. No Borrower has, as of the Closing Date, any
Contingent Obligation, contingent liability or unusual long-term commitment that
is not reflected in the foregoing financial statements or the notes thereto and,
as of any Funding Date subsequent to the Closing Date, is not reflected in the
most recent financial statements delivered to Lenders pursuant to subsection 6.1
or the notes thereto (other than (a) those liabilities reflected on the
Schedules to this Agreement and (b) Performance Guaranties and Contingent
Obligations that are permitted to be incurred under subsection 7.4) and that, in
any such case, is material in relation to the

                                       70
<PAGE>

business, operations, properties, assets or financial condition of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         5.4      NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE; NO RESTRICTED PAYMENTS.

                  Since December 31, 2002, no event or change has occurred
(other than as disclosed in reports delivered pursuant to subsection 6.1(i) of
the DIP Credit Agreement) that has resulted in or evidences, either in any case
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Since the Petition Date, neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has directly or indirectly declared,
ordered, paid or made, or set apart any sum or property for, any Restricted
Payment or agreed to do so except (i) as permitted by subsection 7.5, and (ii)
as was permitted by subsection 7.5 of the DIP Credit Agreement.

         5.5      TITLE TO PROPERTIES; LIENS; REAL PROPERTY; INTELLECTUAL
                  PROPERTY.

                  A.       TITLE TO PROPERTIES; LIENS. Company and its
Subsidiaries have (i) good, sufficient and legal title to (in the case of fee
interests in real property), (ii) valid leasehold interests in (in the case of
leasehold interests in real or personal property), or (iii) good title to (in
the case of all other personal property), all of their respective material
properties and assets reflected in the financial statements referred to in
subsection 5.3 or in the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to
subsection 6.1, in each case except for assets disposed of since the date of
such financial statements in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise
permitted under subsection 7.7. Except as permitted by this Agreement, all such
properties and assets are free and clear of Liens.

                  B.       REAL PROPERTY. As of the Closing Date, Schedule 5.5B
annexed hereto contains a true, accurate and complete list of (i) all fee
interests in any Real Property Assets and (ii) all leases, subleases or
assignments of leases (together with all amendments, modifications, supplements,
renewals or extensions of any thereof) affecting each Real Property Asset,
regardless of whether a Borrower is the landlord or tenant (whether directly or
as an assignee or successor in interest) under such lease, sublease or
assignment. Except as specified in Schedule 5.5B annexed hereto, each agreement
listed in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is in full force and
effect and no Borrower has knowledge of any material default that has occurred
and is continuing thereunder, and each such agreement constitutes the legally
valid and binding obligation of each applicable Borrower, enforceable against
such Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating
to or limiting creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles.

                  C.       INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. As of the Closing Date,
Schedule 5.5C annexed hereto contains a true, accurate and complete list of all
material Intellectual Property. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries owns or has
the right to use all material Intellectual Property used in the conduct of its
business, and none of such Intellectual Property conflicts with a right of any
other Person to the extent such conflict could reasonably be expect to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       71
<PAGE>

         5.6      LITIGATION; ADVERSE FACTS.

                  Except as set forth in Schedule 5.6 annexed hereto, there are
no Proceedings (whether or not purportedly on behalf of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) at law or in equity, or before or by any court or other Government
Authority (including any Environmental Claims) that are pending or, to the
knowledge of any Borrower, threatened against or affecting Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any property of Company or any of its Subsidiaries and that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is in
violation of any applicable laws (including Environmental Laws) that,
individually or in the aggregate (together with all such Proceedings with
respect to substantially similar or related matters), would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) is subject to or in
default with respect to any final judgments, writs, injunctions, decrees, rules
or regulations of any court or other Government Authority that, individually or
in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.7      PAYMENT OF TAXES.

                  Except to the extent permitted by subsection 6.3, all material
tax returns and reports of Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed by
any of them have been timely filed, and all taxes shown on such tax returns to
be due and payable (other than taxes represented by the Tax Note) and all
assessments, fees and other governmental charges upon Company and its
Subsidiaries and upon their respective properties, assets, income, businesses
and franchises that are due and payable have been paid when due and payable. No
Borrower knows of any proposed tax assessment against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, that Company or its Subsidiaries dispute or disagree with, that is
not being actively contested by Company or such Subsidiary in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings; provided that such reserves or other appropriate
provisions, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been
made or provided therefor.

         5.8      PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS; MATERIAL CONTRACTS.

                  A.       Except as set forth on Schedule 5.8A annexed hereto,
after giving effect to the Approved Plan of Reorganization, neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in default in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any
of its Contractual Obligations, and no condition exists that, with the giving of
notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default except
where the consequences, direct or indirect, of such default or defaults, if any,
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  B.       Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is otherwise subject to (i) any agreements or instruments the
performance of which, in the ordinary course, would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) any charter or other internal
restrictions which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       72
<PAGE>

                  C.       Schedule 5.8C contains a true, correct and complete
list of all the Material Contracts in effect on the Closing Date after giving
effect to the Approved Plan of Reorganization. Except as described on Schedule
5.8C, all such Material Contracts are in full force and effect and no material
defaults currently exist thereunder.

         5.9      GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.

                  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
regulation under (i) the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, (ii) the
Federal Power Act (other than as a "qualifying small power production facility",
as such term is defined in PURPA), (iii) the Interstate Commerce Act, (iv) the
Investment Company Act of 1940, or (v) any other federal or state statute or
regulation which may limit its ability to incur Indebtedness or which may
otherwise render all or any portion of the Obligations unenforceable.

         5.10     SECURITIES ACTIVITIES.

                  A.       Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock.

                  B.       Not more than 25% of the value of the assets (either
of Company only or of Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis)
subject to the provisions of subsection 7.2 or 7.7 or subject to any restriction
contained in any agreement or instrument, between Company and any Lender or any
Affiliate of any Lender, relating to Indebtedness and within the scope of
subsection 8.2, will be Margin Stock.

         5.11     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

                  A.       Company, each of its Subsidiaries and, with respect
to Pension Plans and Multiemployer Plans, each of their respective ERISA
Affiliates are in material compliance with all applicable provisions and
requirements of ERISA, the regulations and published interpretations thereunder
and other applicable law with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, and have
performed all of their material obligations under each Employee Benefit Plan.
Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all
applicable laws and orders of foreign Government Authorities with respect to
each of its pension plans and employee benefit plans for foreign employees, and
have performed all of their material obligations under each such pension plan
and employee benefit plan. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received, or has
timely taken all action necessary to receive, a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service to such effect and no event has occurred
(other than the enactment of legislation for which the remedial amendment period
has not expired) that would reasonably be expected to affect adversely such
Plan's qualification.

                  B.       No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected
to occur.

                  C.       Except to the extent required under Section 4980B of
the Internal Revenue Code or except as set forth in Schedule 5.11 annexed hereto
or in the financial statements delivered to Lenders pursuant to subsection 4.1
or 6.1 hereof, as applicable, no Employee Benefit

                                       73
<PAGE>

Plan provides health or welfare benefits (through the purchase of insurance or
otherwise) for any retired or former employee of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries, to the extent such CPIH Subsidiaries
are ERISA Affiliates of Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

                  D.       As of January 1 of each year (based on, with respect
to the Covanta Energy Pension Plan, the actuarial valuation as of such January 1
and, with respect to the SEIU Pension Plan, the actuarial valuation as of the
immediately preceding June 1), the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA, but determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes with respect to a Pension Plan
(as set forth in Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code, including, where
applicable, the interest rate assumptions set forth in Section 412(l) of the
Internal Revenue Code)), in the aggregate for all Pension Plans (excluding for
purposes of such computation any Pension Plans with respect to which assets
exceed benefit liabilities), does not exceed (i) $20,000,000, in the event the
applicable law (including statutorily prescribed actuarial assumptions) used in
determining such unfunded benefit liabilities (the "ASSUMPTIONS") is generally
as favorable as the Assumptions used in the 2003 plan year valuations with
respect to such Pension Plans, or (ii) $26,000,000, in the event the Assumptions
are generally less favorable than the Assumptions used in the 2003 plan year
valuations with respect to such Pension Plans.

                  E.       To each Borrower's knowledge, as of the most recent
valuation date for each Multiemployer Plan for which the actuarial report (or an
estimate provided pursuant to Section 4221(e) of ERISA) is reasonably available
to Company, the potential withdrawal liability of Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective ERISA Affiliates for a complete withdrawal from such
Multiemployer Plan (within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA), when
aggregated with the potential liability for a complete withdrawal from all other
Multiemployer Plans for which such actuarial report (or an estimate provided
pursuant to Section 4221(e) of ERISA) is reasonably available to Company, based
on the information contained in such reports, would not reasonably be expected
to exceed $7,500,000.

                  F.       Neither Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred or is
reasonably expected to incur any material liability pursuant to Title IV of
ERISA with respect to any employee benefit plan of an entity that was formerly
an ERISA Affiliate of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any
employee benefit plan that was previously maintained by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries, to the extent such CPIH Subsidiaries
are ERISA Affiliates of Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

         5.12     CERTAIN FEES.

                  No broker's or finder's fee or commission will be payable with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
each Borrower hereby indemnifies Lenders against, and agrees that it will hold
Lenders harmless from, any claim, demand or liability for any such broker's or
finder's fees alleged to have been incurred in connection herewith or therewith
and any expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of

Agent of any Pledged Collateral of the Credit Parties not delivered to
Collateral Agent at the time of execution and delivery of the applicable
Collateral Document (all of which Pledged Collateral has been so delivered) are
effective to create in favor of Collateral Agent, for the benefit of Secured
Parties, a Lien on all of the Collateral of the Credit Parties (which Lien has
priority over any other Lien on such Collateral, subject to Permitted
Encumbrances and Liens permitted under subsection 7.2A), and all filings and
other actions necessary or desirable to perfect and maintain the perfection and
such priority of such Liens have been duly made or taken and remain in full
force and effect, other than the filing of any UCC financing statements
delivered to Collateral Agent for filing (but not yet filed) and the periodic
filing of UCC continuation statements in respect of UCC financing statements
filed by or on behalf of Collateral Agent.

                  B.       GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS. No authorization,
approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Government
Authority is required for either (i) the pledge or grant by any Credit Party of

rights or remedies in respect of any Collateral (whether specifically granted or

                  No representation or warranty of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries) contained in any Credit Document or
in any other certificate or written statement (excluding the projections, pro
forma financial statements and forward looking statements contained therein and
the estimates contained in such projections, pro forma financial statements and
forward looking statements) furnished to Lenders by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries), including any such Person's
officers, employees, agents, advisors, representatives or counsel, for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, contained as of
the date such representation or warranty was made any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein or therein not misleading in any material respect in
light of the circumstances in which the same were made and in light of such
representations and warranties and all such prior representations and
warranties, taken as a whole. Any projections and pro forma financial
information contained in such materials are based upon good faith estimates and
assumptions believed by each Borrower to be reasonable at the time made, it
being recognized by Lenders that such projections as to future events are
subject to significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive
uncertainties and contingencies, and, accordingly, no assurances are given and
no representations or warranties are made by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that any of the estimates and assumptions are correct, that the projections will
be achieved or that the forward looking statements expressed in such information

Subsidiaries owns any interest in any Subsidiary which is not a Borrower (other

                  B.       DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARY ASSETS. Each Subsidiary which is
a Borrower has granted a Lien in favor of Collateral Agent on substantially all
of its property (other than the Capital Stock of CPIH) pursuant to the
Collateral Documents, except in any case where the grant of such Lien would
constitute a material violation of a valid and enforceable Contractual
Obligation in favor of or for the benefit of a Person other than Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates for which the required
consents have not been obtained.

                                       77

Stock of those Subsidiaries (other than Borrowers) (i) which is subject to a
Lien permitted under subsection 7.2A securing Indebtedness permitted under
subsection 7.1, or (ii) the pledge of which would constitute a material
violation of (a) a valid and enforceable Contractual Obligation in favor of or
for the benefit of a Person other than Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates for which the required consents have not been
obtained or (b) applicable law affecting such Borrower or such Subsidiary.

                  All obligations in existence immediately after the Closing
Date (other than obligations that do not, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000,000)

support or to make investments or expenditures with respect to existing or
future Projects of any Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower that are

Borrowers have made such inquiry and investigation as is necessary to enable
Borrowers to make the representation contained in the preceding sentence.

                  A.       PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. There have been no material

Reorganization. Any representation and warranty made by Borrowers or any
Subsidiary in the Approved Plan of Reorganization is accurate, true and correct
in all material respects as of the Closing Date (or, to the extent such
representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, that such
representations and warranties were accurate, true and correct in all material
respects as of such earlier date).

         5.22     REPORTING TO IRS.

                  Company does not intend to treat the Letters of Credit and
related transactions as being a "reportable transaction" (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). In the event Company determines to take
any action inconsistent with such intention, it will promptly notify
Administrative Agent thereof. Company acknowledges that one or more Lenders may
treat their Letters of Credit as part of a transaction that is subject to
Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4 or section 301.6112-1, and Administrative
Agent and such Lender or Lenders,

                                       78

         matters, or, if such a failure to comply has come to their attention,
         specifying the nature and period of existence thereof (it being

                           Subsidiaries of giving rise to a Material Adverse
                           Effect; or

         any ERISA Event or (b) any event that would constitute an ERISA Event
         but for the requirements (in order for such event to constitute an
         ERISA Event) that a Lien or liability imposed as a result thereof be
         material, that the error giving rise thereto be in bad faith, and/or
         that such event would reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect, a written notice specifying the nature thereof, what
         action Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective

right or franchise if the management or Governing Body of Company or such
Subsidiary shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable
in the conduct of the business of Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may
be, and the loss thereof could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(including claims for labor, services, materials and supplies) for material sums
that have become due and payable and that by law have or may become a Lien upon
any of its properties or assets, prior to the time when any penalty or fine
shall be incurred with respect thereto; provided that no such tax, assessment,
charge or claim need be paid if it is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted, so long as
(i) such reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required in
conformity with GAAP shall have been made therefor and (ii) in the case of a
tax, assessment, charge or claim which has or may become a Lien against any of

         6.4      MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES; INSURANCE; APPLICATION OF NET
                  INSURANCE/ CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS.

                  A.       MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. Company will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain or cause to be maintained in good
repair, working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, all
material properties used or useful in the business of Company and its
Subsidiaries (including all Intellectual Property) and from time to time will
make or cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements
thereof, except that Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to
perform the foregoing obligations (i) with respect to Subsidiaries or assets to
which Persons other than Company and its Subsidiaries have recourse under
Limited Recourse Debt owed to such Persons or (ii) to the extent that failure to
perform such obligations would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  B.       INSURANCE. Company will maintain or cause to be
maintained, with financially sound and reputable insurers, such public liability
insurance, third party property damage insurance, business interruption
insurance and casualty insurance with respect to liabilities, losses or damage
in respect of the assets, properties and businesses of Company and its
Subsidiaries and, for not less than one year following the Closing Date, of CPIH
Subsidiaries (provided that Company shall not be required to maintain such
insurance with respect to CPIH Subsidiaries to the extent such insurance is not
commercially available to Company) as may customarily be carried or maintained
under similar circumstances by corporations of established reputation engaged in
similar businesses, in each case in such amounts (giving effect to
self-insurance), with such deductibles, covering such risks and otherwise on
such terms and conditions as shall be customary for corporations similarly
situated in the industry. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Company will maintain or cause to be maintained (i) flood insurance with respect
to each Flood Hazard Property that is located in a community that participates
in the National Flood Insurance Program, in each case in compliance with any
applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
and (ii) replacement value casualty insurance on the Collateral under such
policies of insurance, with such insurance companies, in such amounts, with such
deductibles, and covering such risks as are at all times satisfactory to
Administrative Agent in its commercially reasonable judgment. Unless prohibited
by contractual or other legal requirement, such policy of insurance shall (a)
name Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties as an additional
insured thereunder as its interests may appear and (b) in the case of each
business interruption and casualty insurance policy, contain a loss payable
clause or endorsement, satisfactory in form and substance to Administrative
Agent, that names Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties as the
loss payee thereunder for any covered loss in excess of $1,000,000 and provides
for at least 30 days prior written notice to Collateral Agent of any
modification or cancellation of such policy. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent a certificate from
Borrowers' insurance broker(s) or other evidence satisfactory to it that all
insurance required to be maintained pursuant to this subsection 6.4 is in full
force and effect and that Collateral Agent on behalf of Secured Parties has been
named as additional insured and/or loss payee thereunder to the extent required
under this subsection 6.4.

         Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any business interruption
         insurance proceeds constituting Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds,
         (a) so long as no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall
         have occurred and be continuing, Company or such Subsidiary may retain
         and apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds for working capital
         purposes or any other purposes not prohibited under this Agreement, and
         (b) if an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing, Company shall apply an amount equal to such
         Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds as provided in subsection 2.3A.

                  (ii)     Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds Received by
         Company. Upon receipt by Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Net
         Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds other than from business interruption
         insurance, (a) so long as no Event of Default or Potential Event of
         Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Company shall, or shall
         cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, promptly and diligently apply
         such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to pay or reimburse the costs
         of repairing, restoring or replacing the assets in respect of which
         such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds were received or, to the
         extent not so applied, as provided in subsection 2.3A, and (b) if an
         Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred and
         be continuing (unless Company is otherwise required to use funds by law
         or contract), Company shall apply an amount equal to such Net
         Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds as provided in subsection 2.3A.

                  (iii)    Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds Received by
         Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent. Upon receipt by
         Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, of any
         Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, (a) if and to the extent Company
         would have been required to apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation
         Proceeds (if it had received them directly) Administrative Agent or
         Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall, and Company hereby
         authorizes Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may
         be, to, apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds as provided in
         subsection 2.3A, and (b) to the extent the foregoing clause (a) does
         not apply Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be,
         shall deliver such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to Company, and
         (1) Company and its Subsidiaries may retain and apply any portion
         thereof that is business interruption insurance proceeds for working
         capital purposes or any other purposes not prohibited under this
         Agreement and (2) Company shall, or shall cause one or more of its
         Subsidiaries to, promptly apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation
         Proceeds that are not business interruption insurance proceeds to the
         costs of repairing, restoring, or replacing the assets in respect of
         which such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds were received; provided,
         however that if at any time Administrative Agent reasonably determines
         (A) that Company or such Subsidiary is not proceeding diligently with
         such repair, restoration or replacement or that such repair,
         restoration or replacement cannot be completed within 180 days after
         the receipt by Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case
         may be, of such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, Administrative
         Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall, and Company
         hereby authorizes Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent,

                                       86

         as provided in subsection 2.3A.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Net Insurance/Condemnation
Proceeds shall be required to be applied as provided in subsection 2.3A to the
extent such application would constitute a material violation of (1) a valid
Contractual Obligation (in effect on the Closing Date or arising under the
documentation for Limited Recourse Debt permitted to be incurred under this
Agreement) in favor of or for the benefit of a Person other than Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates for which the required
consents have not been obtained or (2) applicable law affecting Company and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event of any conflict or inconsistency between subsection 6.4C and the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall
prevail.

         Governmental Authorizations required under any Environmental Laws for
         their

                                       88
<PAGE>

         respective operations except to the extent the failure to maintain such
         Governmental Authorizations could not reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on any Lender or Agent and
         (b) any proposed action to be taken by Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries to commence manufacturing or other industrial operations
         or to modify current operations in a manner that could reasonably be
         expected to subject Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
         additional obligations or requirements under any Environmental Laws
         that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
         aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on any Lender
         or Agent; and

                  (v)      Certain Communications. With respect to documents
         which would have been required to be provided to Administrative Agent
         pursuant to paragraph (i) or (iii) but for the parenthetical in those
         paragraphs, Company shall promptly upon receiving such documents
         provide a list identifying generally the documents not disclosed and
         summarizing the information contained in such documents to the extent
         consistent with not waiving any privilege with respect thereto. If the
         privilege prevents Company from summarizing the information contained
         in such documents Company (a) shall nevertheless advise Administrative
         Agent that a matter, the nature of which cannot be disclosed without
         waiving the applicable privilege, exists with respect to a specified
         Facility or Environmental Claim that, individually or in the aggregate,
         could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
         (b) shall provide such other information to Administrative Agent,
         consistent with not waving the privilege, that Administrative Agent may
         reasonably request.

                  B.       COMPANY'S ACTIONS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND
VIOLATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. Company shall promptly take, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries promptly to take, any and all actions necessary to (i)
cure any violation of applicable Environmental Laws by Company or its
Subsidiaries (including, solely with respect to periods prior to the Closing
Date, CPIH Subsidiaries) that could reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) make an appropriate
response to any Environmental Claim against Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, solely with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date, CPIH
Subsidiaries) and discharge any obligations it may have to any Person thereunder
where failure to do so could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (except if Company and its Subsidiaries
do not have standing to contest or respond to such Environmental Claim);
provided, however, that Company may, without breaching the requirements of this
subsection 6.7B, contest an alleged violation of Environmental Laws or an
Environmental Claim in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted
and diligently conducted so long as during such contest the failure to cure such
violation or to respond to such Environmental Claim or discharge the obligations
thereunder could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.

                  A.       EXECUTION OF BORROWER JOINDER AGREEMENT AND PERSONAL
PROPERTY COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS. In the event that any Subsidiary of Company
existing on the Closing

                                       89
<PAGE>

Date ceases to be an Excluded Subsidiary, Company will promptly notify
Administrative Agent of that fact and cause such Subsidiary promptly (and in any
event no later than 30 days after it ceases to be an Excluded Subsidiary) to
execute and deliver to Administrative Agent a Borrower Joinder Agreement and
counterparts of the Security Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and to
take all such further actions and execute all such further documents and
instruments (including actions, documents and instruments comparable to those
described in subsection 4.1M) as may be necessary or, in the opinion of
Administrative Agent, desirable to create in favor of Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of Secured Parties, a valid and perfected First Priority security
interest in all of the personal and mixed property assets of such Subsidiary
described in the applicable forms of Collateral Documents, subject to any Liens
in existence on the date such Subsidiary ceases to be an Excluded Subsidiary to
the extent permitted under subsection 7.2A, provided that at the request of
Company in connection with sales of assets permitted under subsection 7.7,
Administrative Agent shall, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
direct Collateral Agent (without need for any further consent from any Lender or
Lenders) to release any Liens on a Subsidiary's assets and/or release a
Subsidiary from this Agreement solely to the extent required by the terms of any
such sales permitted under this Agreement; provided, however, that no Capital
Stock of any Subsidiary that meets the criteria set forth in subsections
5.18C(i) or 5.18C(ii) shall be required to be pledged as Collateral pursuant to
this subsection.

                  B.       SUBSIDIARY ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS, LEGAL OPINIONS,
ETC. Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent, together with the relevant
Credit Documents, (i) certified copies of Organizational Documents of each
Subsidiary which is becoming a Borrower pursuant to subsection 6.8A (each, an
"ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARY BORROWER"), together with a good standing certificate
from the Secretary of State of the jurisdiction of such Subsidiary's
organization and each other state in which such Person is qualified to do
business and, to the extent generally available, a certificate or other evidence
of good standing as to payment of any applicable franchise or similar taxes from
the appropriate taxing authority of each of such jurisdictions, each to be dated
a recent date prior to their delivery to Administrative Agent, (ii) a
certificate executed by the secretary or similar officer of such Subsidiary as
to (a) the fact that the attached resolutions of the Governing Body of such
Subsidiary approving and authorizing the execution, delivery and performance of
such Credit Documents are in full force and effect and have not been modified or
amended and (b) the incumbency and signatures of the officers of such Subsidiary
executing such Credit Documents, and (iii) a favorable opinion of counsel to
such Subsidiary, in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent and
its counsel, as to (a) the due organization and good standing of such
Subsidiary, (b) the due authorization, execution and delivery by such Subsidiary
of such Credit Documents, (c) the enforceability of such Credit Documents
against such Subsidiary and (d) such other matters (including matters relating
to the creation and perfection of Liens in any Collateral pursuant to such
Credit Documents) as Administrative Agent may reasonably request, all of the
foregoing to be satisfactory in form and substance to Administrative Agent and
its counsel.

                  C.       RELEASE OF RESTRICTIONS. Borrowers shall use their
good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents
from all Persons in whose favor or for whose benefit Contractual Obligations are
in effect which would be violated by (i) a pledge of the Capital Stock of any
Subsidiary of a Borrower, (ii) entry into a Borrower Joinder Agreement by a
Subsidiary which is not already a Borrower, or (iii) granting a Lien on

                                       90
<PAGE>

substantially all of the assets of a Subsidiary. The foregoing efforts shall be
exercised so as to obtain such consents as soon as practicable but no later than
90 days after the Closing Date.

         6.9      MATTERS RELATING TO ADDITIONAL REAL PROPERTY COLLATERAL.

                  From and after the Closing Date, in the event that any
Borrower acquires any fee interest in real property or any Material Leasehold
Property, such Borrower shall, as soon as practicable after such Person acquires
such real property or Material Leasehold Property, execute, acknowledge, file,
record, do and deliver all and any further acts, deeds, conveyances, mortgages,
hypothecations, pledges, charges, assignments, financing statements and
continuations thereof, notices of assignment, transfers, certificates,
assurances and other instruments, opinions, appraisals, title insurance and
environmental reports as Administrative Agent may reasonably request to perfect
and maintain the Liens created by the Collateral Documents, including, without
limitation, deliver to Collateral Agent in proper form for recording in all
appropriate places in all applicable jurisdictions, encumbering the interest of
such Borrower in such mortgaged property; and such opinions, appraisal,
documents, title insurance, environmental reports that would have been delivered
on the Closing Date if such mortgaged were a Closing Date Mortgaged Property,
and to assure, convey, assign, transfer and confirm unto Collateral Agent, for
the benefit of the Secured Parties, the property and rights thereby conveyed and
assigned or intended to now or hereafter be conveyed or assigned or that any
Borrower may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or to assign to
Administrative Agent.

         6.10     DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS.

                  Borrowers shall, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries
(other than Bankrupt Subsidiaries) to, maintain the Cash Management System as
described in Schedule 4.1P, as said Schedule 4.1P may be supplemented from time
to time pursuant to clause (i)(c) below, and Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not open or close Deposit Accounts or make other changes to the Cash Management
System without the written consent of Administrative Agent, except that (i)
Company and its Subsidiaries may open and maintain funds in Deposit Accounts
with Collateral Agent or other depository institutions after the Closing Date so
long as (a) concurrently with the opening of any such account with a depository
institution other than Collateral Agent, Borrowers shall deliver to
Administrative Agent a Control Agreement with respect to such account (unless
after giving effect to such opening Borrowers would not be in breach of the
requirement set forth in clause (i)(b)), (b) the aggregate amount on deposit at
any time in all Deposit Accounts maintained with depository institutions other
than Collateral Agent for which Control Agreements have not been delivered to
Administrative Agent shall not exceed $1,000,000, and (c) concurrently with the
opening of any such account, Borrowers shall deliver to Administrative Agent a
written notice setting forth the account number and the name of the relevant
depository institution (it being understood that such written notice shall be
deemed to supplement Schedule 4.1P annexed hereto for all purposes of this
Agreement) and, if applicable, the Project to which such account relates and the
primary purpose of such account, and (ii) after the Closing Date Company and its
Subsidiaries may open and maintain funds in Restricted Accounts that are
required to be opened by Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
Contractual Obligation binding on such Person so long as promptly upon opening
any such account, a written notice setting forth in reasonable detail (a) the
Project or obligation to which

                                       91
<PAGE>

such account relates, (b) a description of the Contractual Obligation requiring
such account to be opened, and (c) the provisions of this Agreement permitting
such account to be opened and maintained (it being understood that such written
notice shall be deemed to supplement Schedule 2.3A(i)(f) annexed hereto for all
purposes of this Agreement).

         6.11     FURTHER ASSURANCES.

                  A.       ASSURANCES. Without expense or cost to Agents or
Lenders, each Borrower shall from time to time hereafter execute, acknowledge,
file, record, do and deliver all and any further acts, deeds, conveyances,
mortgages, deeds of trust, deeds to secure debt, security agreements,
hypothecations, pledges, charges, assignments, financing statements and
continuations thereof, notices of assignment, transfers, certificates,
assurances and other instruments as Administrative Agent may from time to time
reasonably request and that do not involve a material expansion of Borrowers'
obligations or liabilities hereunder in order to carry out more effectively the
purposes of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and the Confirmation
Order, including to subject any Collateral, intended to now or hereafter be
covered, to the Liens created by the Collateral Documents and the Confirmation
Order, to perfect and maintain such Liens, and to assure, convey, assign,
transfer and confirm unto Collateral Agent the property and rights thereby
conveyed and assigned or intended to now or hereafter be conveyed or assigned or
that any Borrower may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or to assign to
Collateral Agent or for carrying out the intention of or facilitating the
performance of the terms of this Agreement, any other Credit Documents or the
Confirmation Order, registering or recording this Agreement or any other Credit
Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrowers shall
deliver to Collateral Agent, promptly upon receipt thereof, all instruments
received by Borrowers after the Closing Date and take all actions and execute
all documents necessary or reasonably requested by Collateral Agent to perfect
Collateral Agent's Liens in any such instrument or any other Investment acquired
by any Borrower.

                  B.       FILING AND RECORDING OBLIGATIONS. Each Borrower shall
jointly and severally pay all filing, registration and recording fees and all
expenses incident to the execution and acknowledgement of any Mortgage or other
Credit Document, including any instrument of further assurance described in
subsection 6.11A, and shall pay all mortgage recording taxes, transfer taxes,
general intangibles taxes and governmental stamp and other taxes, duties,
imposts, assessments and charges arising out of or in connection with the
execution, delivery, filing, recording or registration of any Mortgage or other
Credit Document, including any instrument of further assurance described in
subsection 6.11A, or by reason of its interest in, or measured by amounts
payable under, the Notes, the Mortgages or any other Credit Document, including
any instrument of further assurance described in subsection 6.11A, (excluding
income, franchise and doing business Taxes), and shall pay all stamp Taxes and
other Taxes required to be paid on any Credit Document; provided, however, that
such Borrower may contest in good faith and through appropriate proceedings, any
such Taxes, duties, imposts, assessments and charges; provided further, however,
that such Borrower shall pay all such Taxes, duties, imposts and charges when
due to the appropriate taxing authority during the pendency of any such
proceedings if required to do so to stay enforcement thereof. If any Borrower
fails to make any of the payments described in the preceding sentence within 10
days after notice thereof from Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as
is necessary to protect the loss of or diminution in value of any Collateral by
reason of tax foreclosure or otherwise, as determined by Administrative Agent)

                                       92
<PAGE>

accompanied by documentation verifying the nature and amount of such payments,
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) pay the amount due and
Borrowers shall jointly and severally reimburse all amounts in accordance with
the terms hereof.

                  C.       COSTS OF DEFENDING AND UPHOLDING THE LIEN.
Administrative Agent may, upon at least five days' prior notice to Borrowers,
(i) appear in and defend any action or proceeding, in the name and on behalf of
any Agent, Lenders or any Borrower, in which any Agent or any Lender is named or
which Administrative Agent in its sole discretion determines is reasonably
likely to materially adversely affect any Mortgaged Property, any other
Collateral, any Mortgage, the Lien thereof or any other Credit Document and (ii)
institute any action or proceeding which Administrative Agent reasonably
determines should be instituted to protect the interest or rights of Agents and
Lenders in any Mortgaged Property or other Collateral or under this Agreement or
any other Credit Document. Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree that all
reasonable costs and expenses expended or otherwise incurred pursuant to this
subsection (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) by
Administrative Agent shall be paid pursuant to subsection 10.2 hereof.

         6.12     HIGH YIELD NOTES.

                  Company shall obtain no later than three months after the
Closing Date, ratings of the High Yield Notes from S&P and/or Moody's; provided,
however, that if such ratings shall not have been obtained by such date solely
due to inaction or a refusal to act by any such rating agency that is, in either
case, beyond the control of Borrowers (as determined in the reasonable judgment
of Administrative Agent), Borrowers shall not be in breach of this subsection
6.12 so long as Borrowers shall take all steps Agents reasonably request from
time to time to obtain such ratings.

         6.13     MOST FAVORED NATIONS PAYMENTS.

                  Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
extend any fees or pricing increases, to the extent such fees or pricing
increases are the direct obligation of Company or its Subsidiaries, resulting
from the amendment, waiver or modification, after the Closing Date, of the New
L/C Facility Documents, on an equivalent basis (based in the case of fees on the
respective amounts of Letter of Credit Exposure outstanding (on one hand) and
the credit exposure under the New L/C Facility Documents (on the other hand)) to
the Lenders regardless of whether a particular Lender has participated in or
consented to a corresponding amendment, waiver or modification (if any) of the
Credit Documents, and any such payment of equivalent fees shall be paid in cash
concurrently with the fees giving rise to such equivalent fees.

SECTION 7.        BORROWERS' NEGATIVE COVENANTS

                  Borrowers covenant and agree that, so long as any of the
Letter of Credit Commitments hereunder shall remain in effect and until payment
in full of all Obligations and the cancellation or expiration of all Letters of
Credit, unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise give prior written consent,
Borrowers shall perform, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to perform,
all covenants in this Section 7.

         proceeds of such Indebtedness are applied to working capital, capital
         expenditure, maintenance, operation, payroll and other liquidity
         requirements in the ordinary course of business of the Subsidiaries
         incurring such Indebtedness; provided, that (a) no such Indebtedness
         may be incurred at any time that Borrowers shall not be in compliance
         with subsection 7.6E, (b) no such Indebtedness may be incurred to make
         capital expenditures if after giving effect to such expenditures
         Borrowers would not be in pro forma compliance with subsection 7.6F,

         Subsidiary of Company the proceeds of which are applied to Development
         Expenses; provided that Development Expenses for all Projects of
         Company's Subsidiaries at any time after the Closing Date, net of any
         such Development Expenses that have theretofore been reimbursed after
         the Closing Date by the client of the relevant Project, shall not
         exceed on any date of determination an amount equal to (a) $3,000,000
         plus (b) the product of $3,000,000 multiplied by the number of Fiscal
         Years that have commenced following January 31, 2004 but prior to such
         date of determination; and provided further, that all such intercompany
         Indebtedness shall be evidenced by the Intercompany Master Note;

         Person permitted to remain outstanding under subsection 7.1(vi);
         provided, that in each case (a) the terms (excluding the interest rate
         and fees payable with respect thereto, so long as such interest and
         fees on such Indebtedness are not borne directly or indirectly by
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether through an offset to or
         deduction against service or operating agreement fees to Company or its
         Subsidiaries or otherwise) of such Indebtedness as refinanced,
         replaced, renewed or extended, taken as a whole (considering the
         economic benefits and disadvantages to Company and its Subsidiaries
         from such refinancing, replacement, renewal, or extension, as well as
         the economic benefits and disadvantages to Company and its Subsidiaries
         of the Project to which such Indebtedness relates), shall not be more

         and the Lenders than the Indebtedness so refinanced, replaced, renewed
         or extended, (b) the principal amount of the Indebtedness as
         refinanced, replaced, renewed or extended shall not exceed 110% of the
         principal amount of the Indebtedness so refinanced, replaced, renewed
         or extended (provided that such limitation shall not apply with respect

         Authority) of a Project undertakes to service through the principal
         lease, service or operating agreement of the applicable Project), (c)
         no obligee or beneficiary of such Indebtedness after such refinancing,
         replacement, renewal or extension shall have greater recourse to
         Persons for the payment or collection of such Indebtedness than the
         obligee or beneficiary of the Indebtedness so refinanced, replaced,
         renewed or extended had immediately prior to such transaction, and (d)
         Company shall provide to Agents reasonable prior advance written notice

         respect to Limited Recourse Debt on the Closing Date relating to
         waste-to-energy Projects may, after the Closing Date, become and remain
         liable with respect to Limited Recourse Debt relating to such
         waste-to-energy Projects, so long as (a) all or substantially all the
         proceeds of such Limited Recourse Debt are applied to Expansions of
         such waste-to-energy Projects permitted under subsection 7.3(vii) or to
         ensure compliance with applicable laws and

                                       95
<PAGE>

         regulatory requirements and (b) the incurrence by such Subsidiary of
         such Limited Recourse Debt is required by the existing client (if such
         client is a Government Authority) of the relevant Project and Company
         shall have delivered to Agents an Officer's Certificate to the
         foregoing effect; provided, that after the occurrence and during the
         continuation of an Event of Default, neither Company nor any of its
         Subsidiaries shall enter into a contractual commitment to incur any
         such Limited Recourse Debt;

                  (xii)    Company may become and remain liable with respect to
         Indebtedness consisting solely of its obligations under Insurance
         Premium Financing Arrangements, which obligations shall not exceed at
         any time $30,000,000 in the aggregate;

                  (xiii)   Borrowers may become and remain liable with respect
         to Indebtedness incurred to refinance, replace, defease, renew or
         extend, in whole or in part, the High Yield Notes issued on the Closing
         Date; provided, that (a) the fees, interest rates and pricing terms of
         such Indebtedness as refinanced, replaced, defeased, renewed or

7.2A shall constitute an Event of Default.

                  C.       NO FURTHER NEGATIVE PLEDGES. Neither Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any agreement (other than this Agreement,
the Credit Documents, the New L/C Facility Documents and the High Yield

7.2A(vii), 7.2A(viii), 7.2A(ix), 7.2A(xi), 7.2A(xii) or 7.2A(xiv), or by a Lien

agreement with respect to an Asset Sale which is permitted hereunder, (iii)
specific property that is leased pursuant to a lease permitted hereunder, (iv)

contains no more restrictive provisions relating to prohibiting the creation or
assumption of any Lien upon the properties or assets of the relevant Subsidiary
than the lease, service, operating, partnership or financing agreement so
extended, renewed or replaced, and (v) provisions contained in any New L/C
Facility Agreement described in and permitted under clause (ii) of the
definition of New L/C Facility Agreement.

         Guaranty relating to such Bankrupt Subsidiary that was in effect
         immediately prior to the Closing Date but was terminated on the Closing
         Date, so long as no Persons enter into any such replacement Performance
         Guaranty as obligors other than the obligors under the Performance
         Guaranty being so replaced; provided that no such replacement, renewed
         or extended Performance Guaranty referred to in clause (b) or (c) (x)

         consistent with past practice of Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) in
         no event shall any such Performance Guaranty or Contingent Obligation
         be secured by collateral, (c) no Borrower or Subsidiary other than a
         Person already liable under a substantially similar Contingent
         Obligation with respect to such Project shall become liable under any
         such Contingent Obligation, (d) no Borrower or Subsidiary other than a
         Person already liable under a substantially similar Performance

Subordinated Indebtedness (other than the Tax Note) in accordance with the terms
of, and only to the extent required by, and subject to the subordination

other agreements may be amended from time to time to the extent permitted
hereunder, provided, however, that during the continuance of an Event of
Default, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Company nor any Subsidiary shall fund, contribute or otherwise advance amounts

permitted under such subsection, pay principal, accrued interest and other
amounts owing on such refinanced Indebtedness at such time, provided that such
payments may be made with respect to Limited Recourse Debt during the

proceeds are required to be applied to make such payments under a binding
Contractual Obligation to a third party; (iv) Company and its Subsidiaries may
pay any fees required to be paid to the Agents and Lenders hereunder; (v) so

other than Borrowers or any Subsidiaries of Borrowers, except a dividend payable
solely in shares of that class of stock to the holders of that class, (b) any
redemption, retirement, sinking fund or similar payment, purchase or other
acquisition for value, direct or indirect, of any shares of Capital Stock of

in effect as of the Closing Date or pursuant to an extension, renewal or
replacement of such a Contractual Obligation so long as such extension, renewal
or replacement is otherwise permitted to be entered into hereunder and contains

                  E.       MINIMUM NON-BORROWER CASH FLOW. Company shall not
permit Non-Borrower Cash Flow for any four-Fiscal Quarter period ending at the
end of any Fiscal Quarter, to be less than zero.

                  F.       MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED FACILITIES CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.
Borrowers shall not, and shall not permit their respective Subsidiaries to, make
or incur Consolidated Facilities Capital Expenditures during any Fiscal Year in
excess of the Maximum Consolidated Facilities Capital Expenditures Amount for
such Fiscal Year. For purposes of this subsection 7.6F, the "MAXIMUM
CONSOLIDATED FACILITIES CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AMOUNT" for Fiscal Year 2004 shall
equal $25,000,000 and for each Fiscal Year thereafter shall equal $20,000,000;
provided, however, that the Maximum Consolidated Facilities Capital Expenditures
Amount for any Fiscal Year after 2004 shall be increased by an amount equal to
25% of the excess, if any, of the Maximum Consolidated Facilities Capital
Expenditures Amount for the previous Fiscal Year (prior to giving effect to this
proviso) over the actual amount of Consolidated Facilities Capital Expenditures
made or incurred during such previous Fiscal Year; and provided further,
however, that Company may elect by written notice to Agents to increase the
Maximum Consolidated Facilities Capital Expenditures Amount for any Fiscal Year
by an amount not more than $5,000,000 by decreasing the Maximum Consolidated
Facilities Capital Expenditures Amount for the subsequent Fiscal Year by an
amount equal to the amount of such increase.

                  G.       CERTAIN CALCULATIONS. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) for purposes of calculating Adjusted
EBITDA for any four-Fiscal Quarter period ending prior to the first Fiscal
Quarter of 2005, Adjusted EBITDA for the third and fourth Fiscal Quarters of
2003 and the first Fiscal Quarter of 2004 shall be deemed to be equal to the
correlative amounts set forth opposite such Fiscal Quarters on Schedule 7.6G
annexed hereto; (ii) for purposes of determining compliance with subsection 7.6A
for any four-Fiscal Quarter period ending prior to the last Fiscal Quarter of
2004, Consolidated Cash Interest Expense shall equal the product of (a) actual
Consolidated Cash Interest Expense during the period from the Closing Date to
the end of such four-Fiscal Quarter period multiplied by (b) the ratio of (1)
365 divided by (2) the number of days in such period; and (iii) for purposes of
determining compliance with each of the covenants in this subsection 7.6, each
of Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Worth,
Non-Borrower Cash Flow and Consolidated Facilities Capital Expenditures shall
not include any portion thereof attributable to the results of operations or
financial position, as the case may be, of CPIH Subsidiaries for the relevant
period or as of the relevant date of determination.

                  (i)      any Borrower may be merged with or into a Borrower,
         or be liquidated, wound up or dissolved, or all or any part of its

         result in the obligee or beneficiary of any Indebtedness or Contingent
         Obligation (other than the Obligations) having greater recourse to
         assets or Persons for the payment or collection of such Indebtedness or
         Contingent Obligation than such obligee or beneficiary had immediately
         prior to such transaction;

                  (ii)     (a) any Subsidiary of Company that is not a Borrower
         may be merged with or into any other Subsidiary of Company that is not
         a Borrower, or be liquidated, wound up or dissolved, or all or any part
         of its business, property or assets may be conveyed, sold, leased,
         transferred or otherwise disposed of, in one transaction or a series of
         transactions, to another Subsidiary that is not a Borrower, provided,
         that no such transaction shall result in the obligee or beneficiary of
         any Indebtedness or Contingent Obligation (other than the Obligations)
         having greater recourse to assets or Persons for the payment or
         collection of such Indebtedness or Contingent Obligation than such
         obligee or beneficiary had immediately prior to such transaction; and
         (b) any Immaterial Foreign Subsidiary may be merged with or into any
         Borrower, or be liquidated, wound up or dissolved, or all or any part
         of its business, property or assets may be conveyed, sold, leased,
         transferred or otherwise disposed of, in one transaction or a series of
         transactions, to a Borrower, provided, that (1) no such transaction
         shall result in the obligee or beneficiary of any Indebtedness or
         Contingent Obligation (other than the Obligations) of such Immaterial
         Foreign Subsidiary having greater recourse to assets or Persons for the
         payment or collection of such Indebtedness or Contingent Obligation
         than such obligee or beneficiary had immediately prior to such
         transaction and (2) the relevant Borrower shall be a surviving entity
         in any such transaction;

                  (iii)    Company and its Subsidiaries may sell or otherwise
         dispose of assets in transactions that do not constitute Asset Sales;
         provided that the consideration received for such assets shall be in an
         amount at least equal to the fair market value thereof; and

                  (iv)     Company and its Subsidiaries may make Asset Sales,
         provided that (a) the consideration received for such assets shall be
         in an amount at least equal to the fair market value thereof; (b) not
         less than 90% of the consideration received (other than any
         consideration consisting of the assumption of liabilities related to
         such assets) in any such Asset Sale shall be cash (it being agreed that
         cash the receipt of which may by the relevant terms of such Asset Sale
         be deferred more than six months after the date of consummation of such
         Asset Sale shall not be considered cash for purposes of this clause
         (b)); (c) not more than 10% of the cash consideration received by
         Company and its Subsidiaries in any such Asset Sale shall be received
         after the date of consummation of such Asset Sale; (d) any Indebtedness
         in relation to the assets sold in any such Asset Sale shall be repaid
         and the related letters of credit shall be cancelled and returned to

         issuers thereof; (e) the Net Asset Sale Proceeds of such Asset Sales
         shall be applied as Mandatory Payments to the extent required under
         subsection 2.3A; and (f) in the event that the Net Asset Sale Proceeds
         from any Asset Sale, when added to the aggregate Net Asset Sale
         Proceeds from all other Asset Sales after the Closing Date, would
         exceed $10,000,000, Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be permitted
         to consummate such Asset Sale without the prior written consent of
         Requisite Lenders.

         7.8      TRANSACTIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND AFFILIATES.

                  Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or permit to exist any
transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or
the rendering of any service) with any holder of 5% or more of any class of
equity Securities of Company or with any Affiliate of Company or of any such
holder, on terms that are less favorable to Company or that Subsidiary, as the
case may be, than those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are
not such a holder or Affiliate; provided that the foregoing restriction shall
not apply to (i) any Indebtedness permitted under subsection 7.1 among Company
and its Subsidiaries or among Subsidiaries of Company, (ii) reasonable and
customary salaries and fees paid to current officers and members of the
Governing Bodies of Company and its Subsidiaries, provided that such salary and
fee arrangements are entered into at arms' length and on terms that are no less
favorable to Company or that Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that
would have been obtained at the relevant time from Persons who are not such a
holder or Affiliate, (iii) reasonable and customary indemnifications and
insurance arrangements for the benefit of Persons that are officers or members
of the Governing Bodies of Company and its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing
Date, whether such Persons are current or former officers or members at the time
such indemnifications or arrangements are entered into, provided that such
indemnifications and arrangements are entered into at arms' length and on terms
that are no less favorable to Company or that Subsidiary, as the case may be,
than those that would have been obtained at the relevant time from Persons who
are not such a holder or Affiliate, (iv) any employment agreements or benefits
arrangements entered into on or after the Closing Date by Company and its
Subsidiaries with employees at arms' length and on terms that are no less
favorable to Company or that Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that

holder or Affiliate, (v) payments (and other transactions) made in accordance
with the terms of the Management Services and Reimbursement Agreement, the DHC
Tax Sharing Agreement, the Corporate Services Reimbursement Agreement and the
other Related Agreements, (vi) transactions occurring on the Closing Date and

affiliated for services rendered to Company and its Subsidiaries.

         7.9      RESTRICTION ON LEASES.

                  Borrowers shall not, and shall not permit any of their
Subsidiaries to, become liable in any way, whether directly by assignment or as
a guarantor or other surety, for the obligations of the lessee under any lease
for equipment (other than intercompany leases between Borrowers), unless,
immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of liability with respect to
such lease, the aggregate amount of all rents paid or payable by Company and its
Subsidiaries on

                                      111
<PAGE>

a consolidated basis under all such leases entered into after the Closing Date
at the time in effect during the then current Fiscal Year or any future period
of 12 consecutive calendar months shall not exceed $3,000,000; provided,
however, that this subsection 7.9 shall not prohibit Company or its Subsidiaries
from incurring obligations pursuant to the renewal, extension or replacement of
leases in effect at the Closing Date so long as such leases as renewed, extended
or replaced are not more disadvantageous in any material respect to Company and
its Subsidiaries and the Lenders than the leases so renewed, extended or
replaced.

         7.10     DETROIT PROJECT COVENANTS

                  Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, enter into any Contractual Obligation after the Closing Date
that would (i) grant a right to any Person or Persons to consent to or approve a
sale or other disposition of all or any portion of the Detroit Project or the
Capital Stock of the Detroit Project Subsidiary, (ii) be breached by a sale or
other disposition of all or any portion of the Detroit Project or the Capital
Stock of the Detroit Project Subsidiary if the consent or approval of any Person
or Persons (other than Requisite Lenders) is not obtained, (iii) create any
additional restriction not in existence as of the Closing Date limiting the
ability of Company and its Subsidiaries to sell or dispose of all or any portion

reasonably related to such businesses.

         7.12     AMENDMENTS TO RELATED AGREEMENTS, DEBT DOCUMENTATION AND
                  ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS.

                  Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, amend, restate, modify or waive (or make any payment consistent
with an amendment, restatement, modification or waiver of) any material
provision of (i) the Management Services and Reimbursement Agreement or the
other Related Agreements (other than the New L/C Facility Documents), in each
case if the effect of such amendment, restatement, modification or waiver,
together with all other amendments, restatements, modifications or waivers made,
(a) except as otherwise permitted under subsection 7.1(xiii), is to impose
additional material obligations on, or confer material additional rights to the
holders thereof (or to other obligees with respect thereto) against, Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (b) is otherwise adverse to the interests of the
Lenders in a manner deemed material in the judgment of Agents or Requisite
Lenders so notifying Agents or Company; (ii) the Organizational Documents of
Company and its Subsidiaries, if the effect of such amendment, restatement,
modification or waiver, together with all other amendments, restatements,
modifications or waivers made, is adverse to the interests of the Lenders in a
manner deemed material in the judgment of Agents or Requisite Lenders; (iii) the
Subordinated Indebtedness, if the effect thereof would be to (a) change to
earlier dates the dates on which any

                                      112
<PAGE>

payments of principal or interest are due thereon, (b) increase the interest
rate, or the portion thereof payable on a current basis in cash, applicable
thereto, (c) change any event of default with respect thereto in any manner
adverse to the interests of the Lenders, (d) change the redemption, prepayment
or defeasance provisions thereof, (e) change the subordination provisions
thereof (or of any guaranty thereof or intercreditor arrangement with respect
thereto), (f) change any collateral therefor (other than to release such
collateral), or (g) change any other term or provision thereof, if the effect of
such change, together with all other changes made, is to increase materially the
obligations of the obligor thereunder or to confer any additional rights on the
holders of such Indebtedness that would be materially adverse (in the judgment
of Agents or Requisite Lenders so notifying Agents or Company) to Company,
Agents or the Lenders, without the prior written consent of Requisite Lenders;
(iv) the principal documents relating to Limited Recourse Debt with respect to a
Project if such amendment, restatement, modification or waiver, together with
all other amendments, restatements, modifications and waivers made, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or (v) the New L/C
Facility Documents, unless (a) the terms of the New L/C Facility Documents as so
amended, restated, modified or waived are not more disadvantageous to Company
and its Subsidiaries and the Lenders (in a manner deemed material by Agents)
than the New L/C Facility Documents in effect on the Closing Date (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment, restatement, modification or waiver
having the effect of (1) increasing the maximum amount of any commitment to
extend loans (as opposed to letters of credit) under the New L/C Facility
Documents, or (2) reducing, delaying or waiving any otherwise required reduction
in the amount of any commitment to extend loans or letters of credit under the
New L/C Facility Documents, shall be deemed to be more disadvantageous for
purposes of this clause (a) without further notice or other action by Agents),
(b) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness and letters of credit outstanding, and
additional commitments to extend credit, if any, under the New L/C Facility
Documents as so amended, restated, modified or waived, do not exceed the
aggregate amount of the commitments to extend credit in effect under the New L/C
Facility Documents on the Closing Date, plus $5,000,000, (c) the obligations
under (and the Liens securing) such New L/C Facility Documents as so amended,
restated, modified or waived are subject to the Intercreditor Agreement on terms
substantively identical to the terms applicable to the obligations in effect
under the New L/C Facility Documents on the Closing Date, and (d) Company
provides to Agents reasonable prior advance written notice of such proposed
amendment, restatement, modification or waiver and copies of all material
contracts or other agreements being entered into in connection therewith).

         7.13     END OF FISCAL YEARS; FISCAL QUARTERS.

                  Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to change the end of the Fiscal Year of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from December 31st.

         7.14     AMENDMENT TO PENSION PLANS.

                  Borrowers shall not amend or modify any Pension Plan after the
Closing Date in any manner that results in or would reasonably be expected to
result in an increase in the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities (as such
unfunded benefit liabilities are determined in accordance with subsection 5.11D
hereof), unless such amendment or modification is required under applicable law.

         or other agreement relating to such item(s) of Indebtedness or
         Contingent Obligation(s), if the effect of such breach or default is to

         Body of DHC or Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
         Bankrupt Subsidiaries), or any committee thereof, shall adopt any
         resolution or otherwise authorize any action to approve any of the

                  REPUDIATION OF OBLIGATIONS.

                  At any time after the execution and delivery thereof, (i) the
Intercreditor Agreement for any reason, other than the satisfaction in full of
all Obligations, shall cease to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with its terms) or shall be declared to be null and void, (ii) any
Collateral Document (with respect to the obligations thereunder of Company or
any Material Subsidiary (other than any Bankrupt Subsidiary)) shall cease to be
in full force and effect (other than by reason of a release of Collateral
thereunder in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, the satisfaction in
full of the Secured Obligations or any other termination of such Collateral
Document in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof) or shall be declared
null and void, or Collateral Agent shall not have or shall cease to have a valid

                  Any Material Contract of the type described in clause (i) of
the definition of Material Contract, or any power purchase agreement to which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to a Project, shall be
terminated by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by the counterparty or
counterparties thereto, if such termination is enforceable by Company, such
Subsidiary, or such counterparty or counterparties, unless (a) such Material
Contract is replaced within ten (10) days after such termination with a contract
that is reasonably acceptable to the Requisite Lenders and on substantially the
same economic terms as the relevant Material Contract being terminated, or (b)
the Subsidiary of Company party to such Material Contract or power purchase
agreement, as the case may be, is a Bankrupt Subsidiary and such termination
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (c) the
termination of such Material Contract occurs pursuant to the exercise by the

                                      117
<PAGE>

equity contribution would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the availability or accessibility to Company and its Subsidiaries of
the net operating losses disclosed to Agents and Lenders prior to the Closing
Date as being held by DHC, or (ii) the proceeds of such issuance or equity
contribution are applied to any purpose prohibited under this Agreement:

THEN (i) upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in subsection 8.6
or 8.7, each of (a) an amount equal to 105% of the maximum amount that may at
any time be drawn under all Letters of Credit then outstanding (whether or not
any beneficiary under any such Letter of Credit shall have presented, or shall
be entitled at such time to present, the drafts or other documents or
certificates required to draw under such Letter of Credit), and (b) all other
Obligations shall automatically become immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or other requirements of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by each Borrower, and obligation of Administrative Agent
and any other Issuing Lender to issue, renew or extend any Letter of Credit and
the right of Administrative Agent and any other Issuing Lender to issue, renew
or extend any Letter of Credit hereunder shall thereupon terminate, and (ii)
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any other Event of Default,
Administrative Agent shall, upon the written request or with the written consent
of Requisite Lenders, by written notice to Borrowers, declare all or any portion
of the amounts described in clauses (a) and (b) above to be, and the same shall
forthwith become, immediately due and payable, and the obligation of
Administrative Agent and any other Issuing Lender to issue, renew or extend any
Letter of Credit and the right of Administrative Agent and any other Issuing
Lender to issue, renew or extend any Letter of Credit hereunder shall thereupon
terminate.

                  Any amounts described in clause (a) above, when received by
Collateral Agent, shall be held by Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Security Agreement and shall be applied as therein provided (subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

                  Further upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent
and Collateral Agent may, and upon the written request of Requisite Lenders
shall, (i) exercise all rights and remedies of Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent set forth in any of the Collateral Documents, in addition to
all rights and remedies allowed by, the United States and of any state thereof,
including but not limited to the UCC, and (ii) revoke Borrowers' rights to use
cash collateral in which Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent has an
interest. The enumeration of the foregoing rights and remedies is not intended
to be exhaustive and the exercise of any right or remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other rights or remedies, all of which shall be cumulative and
not alternative.

SECTION 9.        ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         9.1      APPOINTMENT.

                  A.       APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Bank of America
is hereby appointed Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Credit
Documents and Deutsche Bank is hereby appointed Documentation Agent hereunder.
Each Lender hereby authorizes each Agent to act as its agent in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. Each Agent agrees to
act upon the express conditions contained in this Agreement

                                      118
<PAGE>

and the other Credit Documents, as applicable. The provisions of this Section 9
are solely for the benefit of Agents and Lenders and no Credit Party shall have
rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions thereof. In
performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, Administrative Agent
(other than as provided in subsection 2.1B) shall act solely as an agent of
Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any
obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for any Borrower
or any other Credit Party.

                  B.       CONTROL. Each Lender and Administrative Agent hereby
appoint each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting Collateral
Agent's security interest in assets that, in accordance with the UCC, can be
perfected by possession or control.

         9.2      POWERS AND DUTIES; GENERAL IMMUNITY.

                  A.       POWERS; DUTIES SPECIFIED. Each Lender irrevocably
authorizes each Agent to take such action on such Lender's behalf and to
exercise such powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Credit
Documents as are specifically delegated or granted to such Agent by the terms
hereof and thereof, together with such powers, rights and remedies as are
reasonably incidental thereto. An Agent shall have only those duties and
responsibilities that are expressly specified in this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents. Each Agent may exercise such powers, rights and remedies and
perform such duties by or through its Affiliates, agents or employees. No Agent
shall have, by reason of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or any Borrower; and nothing in
this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, expressed or implied, is
intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon an Agent any obligations
in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents except as
expressly set forth herein or therein.

                  B.       NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN MATTERS. No Agent shall
be responsible to any Lender for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness,
validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or
statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral statements or
in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports or certificates or
any other documents furnished or made by such Agent to Lenders or by or on
behalf of any Borrower to such Agent or any Lender in connection with the Credit
Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby or for the financial
condition or business affairs of Borrowers or any other Person liable for the
payment of any Obligations, nor shall such Agent be required to ascertain or
inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions,
provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of the Credit Documents or
as to the use of the Letters of Credit or as to the existence or possible
existence of any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default. Anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Administrative
Agent shall not have any liability arising from confirmations of the amount of
the Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts thereof.

                  C.       EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. No Agent or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to Lenders for any
action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the
Credit Documents except to the extent caused by such Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. An Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any

                                      119
<PAGE>

act or the taking of any action (including the failure to take an action) in
connection with this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents or from the
exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or
thereunder unless and until such Agent shall have received instructions in
respect thereof from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required
to give such instructions under subsection 10.6) and, upon receipt of such
instructions from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be),
such Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from
acting, or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with
such instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i)
each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,
upon any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and
shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and
judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for Company and its Subsidiaries),
accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no
Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against an Agent as a result of
such Agent acting or (where so instructed) refraining from acting under this
Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents in accordance with the
instructions of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to
give such instructions under subsection 10.6).

                  D.       AGENTS ENTITLED TO ACT AS LENDER. The agency hereby
created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or
impose any duties or obligations upon, an Agent in its individual capacity as a
Lender hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Letters of Credit, an
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not performing the duties and functions
delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" or any similar
term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include each Agent
in its individual capacity. An Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any
kind of commercial banking, investment banking, trust, financial advisory or
other business with Company or any of its Affiliates as if it were not
performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other
consideration from any Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement
and otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Deutsche Bank or Bank of America
or their respective Affiliates may receive information regarding a Borrower or
its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of such Borrower or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that
the relevant Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to
them.

         9.3      INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION BY LENDERS; NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR
                  APPRAISAL OF CREDITWORTHINESS.

                  Each Lender agrees that it has made its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder and
that it has made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the
creditworthiness of Company and its Subsidiaries. No Agent shall have any duty
or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such
investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming
into its possession before the issuance of any

                                      120
<PAGE>

Letter of Credit or at any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have any
responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any
information provided to Lenders.

         9.4      RIGHT TO INDEMNITY.

                  Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally
agrees to indemnify Agents and the officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys, professional advisors and affiliates of each of them to the extent
that any such Person shall not have been reimbursed by Borrowers, for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and
disbursements and fees and disbursements of any financial advisor engaged by
Agents) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against an Agent or and other such Persons in
exercising the powers, rights and remedies of an Agent or performing duties of
an Agent hereunder or under the other Credit Documents or otherwise in its
capacity as Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
other Credit Documents; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion
of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of an Agent resulting from
such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. If any indemnity furnished
to an Agent or any other such Person for any purpose shall, in the opinion of
such Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, such Agent may call for
additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified
against until such additional indemnity is furnished.

         9.5      SUCCESSOR AGENTS.

                  Any Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days' prior
written notice thereof to Lenders and Borrowers, and an Agent may be removed at
any time with or without cause by an instrument or concurrent instruments in
writing delivered to Borrowers and Administrative Agent and signed by Requisite
Lenders. If Bank of America is an Issuing Lender, any such resignation or
removal of Bank of America as Administrative Agent shall also constitute its
resignation or removal as Issuing Lender. Upon any such notice of resignation or
any such removal, Requisite Lenders shall have the right, upon five Business
Days' notice to Borrowers, to appoint a successor Agent. If, within 30 days
after the date of an Agent's notice of its intention to resign, no successor to
such Agent shall have been so appointed by Requisite Lenders, then such Agent's
resignation shall become effective on such date without the need for any further
action and the Lenders shall be deemed to have been appointed as successor to
such Agent hereunder and shall thereafter perform all the duties of such Agent
hereunder and/or under any other Credit Document until the appointment by
Requisite Lenders of some other successor to such Agent. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as an Agent hereunder by a successor to an Agent, including the
Lenders as successor to an Agent (who shall be deemed to have accepted such
appointment pursuant to this subsection 9.5), such successor to such Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring or removed Agent (and, if the removed Agent is an
Issuing Lender, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuing
Lender), the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement, and, if the retiring or removed Agent is an
Issuing Lender, such retiring or removed Issuing Lender shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations under this Agreement, without any other or further
act or deed on the part of such retiring or removed Issuing Lender or any other
Lender; provided, however, that the successor

                                      121
<PAGE>

Issuing Lender shall be obligated to issue Letters of Credit in substitution for
the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or to
make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring or removed Issuing Lender
to effectively assume the obligations of such retiring or removed Issuing Lender
with respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit, and such retiring or removed
Issuing Lender shall continue to have all rights of an Issuing Lender with
respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit until the cancellation or
expiration of such Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn
thereunder. After any retiring or removed Agent's resignation or removal
hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an
Agent under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

         9.6      INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT.

                  Each Lender hereby further authorizes Administrative Agent, on
behalf of and for the benefit of Lenders, to enter into and to be the agent for
and representative of Lenders under the Intercreditor Agreement, and each Lender
agrees to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that
Administrative Agent shall not (i) enter into or consent to any material
amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision contained in the
Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) release any Collateral (except as otherwise
expressly permitted or required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the
applicable Collateral Document), in each case without the prior consent of
Requisite Lenders (or, if required pursuant to subsection 10.6, all Lenders).
Anything contained in any of the Credit Documents to the contrary
notwithstanding, each Borrower, Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby
agree that (1) no Lender shall have any right individually to realize upon any
of the Collateral under any Collateral Document, it being understood and agreed
that all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents may be
exercised solely by Collateral Agent for the benefit of Lenders in accordance
with the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (2) in the event
of a foreclosure by Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a
public or private sale, Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser
of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale and Administrative Agent, as
agent for and representative of Lenders (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or
their respective individual capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise
agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making
settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the
Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations
as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by
Administrative Agent at such sale.

         9.7      ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

                  In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other judicial proceeding relative to Company or any of the Subsidiaries of
Company, Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether any Obligation shall then
be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on
Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding
or otherwise

                  (i)      to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of any Obligations
         that are owing and unpaid and to file such

                                      122
<PAGE>

         other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to
         have the claims of Lenders and Agents (including any claim for the
         reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
         Lenders and Agents and their agents and counsel and all other amounts
         due Lenders and Agents under subsections 2.2, 3.2 and 10.2) allowed in
         such judicial proceeding, and

                  (ii)     to collect and receive any moneys or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to Administrative Agent and, in the event that
Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to
Lenders, to pay to Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Agents and their agents
and counsel, and any other amounts due Agents under subsections 2.2, 3.2 and
10.2.

                  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lenders or to authorize
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

SECTION 10.       MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS IN
                  LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  A.       GENERAL. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and assigns of Lenders (it
being understood that Lenders' rights of assignment are subject to the further
provisions of this subsection 10.1). Neither any Borrower's rights or
obligations hereunder nor any interest therein may be assigned or delegated by
any Borrower without the prior written consent of all Lenders (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by any Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void). No sale, assignment or transfer or participation of any Letter of Credit
or any participation therein may be made separately from a sale, assignment,
transfer or participation of a corresponding interest in the relevant Letter of
Credit Commitment of the Lender effecting such sale, assignment, transfer or
participation. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Affiliates of each of Agents and Lenders) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. No Lender
shall be permitted to assign any portion of its rights or obligations hereunder
to any other Person if, upon giving effect to such assignment, Borrowers would
be obligated to pay such assignee amounts greater than the amounts, if any,
which Borrowers would have been required to pay such assigning Lender under
subsection 2.4 if such assignment did not occur.

                  B.       ASSIGNMENTS.

                  (i)      Amounts and Terms of Assignments. Any Lender may
         assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of its
         rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided that (a) except
         (1) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
         assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement or (2)
         in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or
         an Approved Fund of a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Letter of
         Credit Exposure of the assigning Lender and the assignee subject to
         each such assignment shall not be less than $5,000,000, determined as
         of the date the Assignment Agreement with respect to such assignment is
         delivered to Administrative Agent or, if a trade date is specified in
         the Assignment Agreement, as of such trade date, unless Administrative
         Agent otherwise consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
         or delayed, (b) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
         deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment Agreement, together with
         a processing and recordation fee of $5,000, and the Eligible Assignee,
         if it shall not be a Lender prior to such assignment, shall deliver to
         Administrative Agent a counterpart to the Intercreditor Agreement and
         such documents and information reasonably requested by Administrative
         Agent, including such forms, certificates or other evidence, if any,
         with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters as
         the assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver
         to Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii), and no such
         assignment shall be effective unless and until such Assignment
         Agreement is accepted by Administrative Agent and recorded in the
         Register as provided in subsection 10.1B(ii), (c) except in the case of
         an assignment to another Lender, Administrative Agent and each Issuing
         Lender shall have consented thereto (which consents shall not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed (it being understood that nothing in
         this clause (c) shall affect the requirement that the relevant assignee
         meet the requirements in the definition of Eligible Assignee and any
         other applicable requirements of this Agreement)), and (d) no
         assignment by a Defaulting Lender shall be permitted unless such
         Defaulting Lender or assignee has funded such Defaulting Lender's
         defaulted funding obligations with respect to participations in Letters
         of Credit; provided, however, that Underwriting Lender shall have the
         right to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations under
         this Agreement, from time to time, without regard to the $5,000,000
         minimum assignment amount (but otherwise in accordance with the terms
         of this Agreement, including this subsection 10.1) set forth in
         subsection 10.1B(i)(a), so long as the aggregate amount of the Letter
         of Credit Exposure of each of the Underwriting Lender and of such
         assignee, determined as of the date the Assignment Agreement with
         respect to such assignment is delivered to Administrative Agent or, if
         a trade date is specified in the Assignment Agreement, as of such trade
         date, shall not be less than $1,000,000. Upon such execution, delivery
         and consent, from and after the effective date specified in such
         Assignment Agreement, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party
         hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have
         been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have
         the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder, (y) the assignee
         shall be a party to the Intercreditor Agreement and, to the extent that
         rights and obligations have been assigned to it pursuant to such
         Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a
         "Creditor Party" thereunder (as such term is defined in the
         Intercreditor Agreement) and (z) the assigning Lender thereunder shall,
         to the

                                      124
<PAGE>

         extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it
         pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other
         than any rights which survive the termination of this Agreement under
         subsection 10.9B) and be released from its obligations under this
         Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement (and, in the case of an
         Assignment Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of an
         assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
         Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
         entitled to the benefits of subsection 10.9; provided that, anything
         contained in any of the Credit Documents to the contrary
         notwithstanding (but subject to subsection 9.5), if such Lender is an
         Issuing Lender such Lender shall continue to have all rights and
         obligations of an Issuing Lender with respect to any Letters of Credit
         issued by it until the cancellation or expiration of such Letters of
         Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder). Other
         than as provided in subsection 10.5, any assignment or transfer by a
         Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
         comply with this subsection 10.1B shall be treated for purposes of this
         Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
         and obligations in accordance with subsection 10.1C. Except as
         otherwise provided in this subsection 10.1, no Lender shall, as between
         Borrowers and such Lender, as between Agents and such Lender, or as
         between Issuing Lender and such Lender, be relieved of any of its
         obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment or transfer
         of, or any granting of participations in, all or any part of its Letter
         of Credit Commitment, Letters of Credit or participations therein or
         the other Obligations owed to such Lender.

                  (ii)     Acceptance by Administrative Agent; Recordation in
         Register. Upon its receipt of an Assignment Agreement executed by an
         assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
         Assignee and the processing and recordation fee referred to in
         subsection 10.1B(i) and any forms, certificates or other evidence with
         respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters that
         such assignee may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent
         pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii), Administrative Agent shall, if
         Administrative Agent and Issuing Lenders have consented to the
         assignment evidenced thereby (to the extent each such consent is
         required pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i)), (a) accept such Assignment
         Agreement by executing a counterpart thereof as provided therein (which
         acceptance shall evidence any required consent of Administrative Agent
         to such assignment), (b) record the information contained therein in
         the Register, and (c) give prompt notice thereof to Company.
         Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment Agreement
         delivered to and accepted by it as provided in this subsection
         10.1B(ii).

                  C.       PARTICIPATIONS. Any Lender may, without the consent
of, or notice to, any Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations to
one or more Persons (other than a natural Person or any Borrower or any of its
Affiliates) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under
this Agreement; provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii)
Borrowers, Agents and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision

                                      125
<PAGE>

of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver directly affecting (i) the extension of the
Maturity Date or (ii) a reduction of the principal amount of or the rate of
interest payable on any Obligation allocated to such participation. Subject to
the further provisions of this subsection 10.1C, each Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of subsection 2.4 to the same
extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to subsection 10.1B. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of subsection 10.4 as though it were a
Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to subsection 10.5 as
though it were a Lender. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under subsection 2.4 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Borrowers'
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-US Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of subsection 2.4.

                  D.       PLEDGES AND ASSIGNMENTS. Any Lender may at any time
pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of the Obligations
owed to such Lender, to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge
or assignment to secure obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank; provided that
(i) no Lender shall be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result
of any such assignment or pledge and (ii) in no event shall any assignee or
pledgee be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require the assigning
Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

                  E.       INFORMATION. Each Lender may furnish any information
concerning Company and its Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries) in the
possession of that Lender from time to time to assignees and participants
(including prospective assignees and participants), subject to subsection 10.20.

                  F.       AGREEMENTS OF LENDERS. Each Lender listed on the
signature pages hereof hereby agrees, and each Lender that becomes a party
hereto pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to agree, (i) that it
is an Eligible Assignee described in clause (i) of the definition thereof; (ii)
that it has experience and expertise in the funding of or purchasing
participations of the type purchased in the Letters of Credit; and (iii) that it
will fund or purchase such participations for its own account in the ordinary
course of its business and without a view to distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities
laws (it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this subsection
10.1, the disposition of such participations or any interests therein shall at
all times remain within its exclusive control).

                  G.       ASSIGNMENTS TO FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS. In addition to
the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of
this subsection 10.1, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of the
Obligations owed to such Lender hereunder to any Federal Reserve Bank as
collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System and any operating circular issued by such Federal Reserve
Bank; provided that (i) no Lender shall, as between Company and such Lender, be
relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment
and pledge and

                                      126
<PAGE>

(ii) in no event shall such Federal Reserve Bank be considered to be a "Lender"
or be entitled to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any
action hereunder.

                  H.       LENDER RATING REQUIREMENTS. Each Lender (to the
extent not already a Downgraded Lender) agrees to notify Administrative Agent
and Issuing Lenders within five Business Days after any downgrade of its long
term senior unsecured debt obligations to a rating of worse than "Baa3" from
Moody's or worse than "BBB-" from S&P (any Lender so downgraded being a
"DOWNGRADED LENDER"). Promptly, and in any event prior to the date which is 10
Business Days after such downgrade, the relevant Downgraded Lender, at its own
expense, shall deliver to Issuing Lenders, at such Downgraded Lender's option,
either (i) evidence satisfactory to Issuing Lenders that the Letter of Credit
Commitment of such Downgraded Lender is irrevocably guaranteed or similarly
supported pursuant to documentation and arrangements (and by Persons) reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent and Issuing Lenders, or (ii) cash
collateral supporting the maximum amount of the Letter of Credit Commitment of
such Downgraded Lender pursuant to documentation and arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent and Issuing Lenders. Each such Downgraded
Lender agrees to pay promptly on demand the reasonable fees and expenses of
Issuing Lenders and Administrative Agent (including reasonable costs, fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the arrangements for such fronting
institution, such guaranty or similar support or such cash collateral.

         10.2     EXPENSES.

Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated,
Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay promptly (i) all the actual and
reasonable costs and expenses of negotiation, preparation and execution of the
Credit Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications
thereto; (ii) all the costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for Credit
Parties (including any opinions requested by Agents or Lenders as to any legal

all agreements and conditions on their part to be performed or complied with
under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents including with respect to
confirming compliance with environmental and insurance requirements; (iii) the
reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of advisors and counsel to Agents
(including O'Melveny & Myers LLP, counsel to Agents, and Ernst & Young Corporate

interpretation or administration of the Credit Documents and any proposed
consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and any other
documents or matters requested by any Borrower; (iv) all the actual costs and
reasonable expenses of creating and perfecting Liens in favor of Collateral
Agent on behalf of Secured Parties pursuant to any Collateral Document,
including filing and recording fees, expenses and taxes, stamp or documentary

disbursements of counsel to Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent and of

respect of the Collateral Documents or the Liens created pursuant thereto; (v)
all the actual costs and reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any
auditors, accountants or appraisers and any environmental or other consultants,
advisors and agents (including Ernst & Young Corporate Finance LLC) employed or
retained by Agents or their counsel; (vi) all the actual costs and reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with the custody or preservation of any of the
Collateral; (vii) all other

                                      127
<PAGE>

the syndication of the Letter of Credit Commitments; and (viii) all the actual
costs and reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of
settlement, incurred by Agents and Lenders in enforcing any Obligations of or in
collecting any payments due from any Credit Party hereunder or under the other
Credit Documents (including in connection with the sale of, collection from, or
other realization upon any of the Collateral) or in connection with any
refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this
Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases or
any other insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.

         10.3     INDEMNITY.

                  In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to subsection
10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated,
Borrowers jointly and severally agree to defend (subject to Indemnitees'
selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold harmless Agents and Lenders
(including Issuing Lenders), and the officers, directors, employees, agents and
affiliates of Agents and Lenders (collectively called the "INDEMNITEES"),
including Issuing Lenders, from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities
(as hereinafter defined); provided that Borrowers shall not have any obligation
to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise solely from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as determined by a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

                  As used herein, "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES" means, collectively,
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages (including natural
resource damages), penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims (including
Environmental Claims), costs (including the costs of any investigation, study,
sampling, testing, abatement, cleanup, removal, remediation or other response
action necessary to remove, remediate, clean up or abate any Hazardous Materials
Activity), expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for Indemnitees in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding
commenced or threatened by any Person, whether or not any such Indemnitee shall
be designated as a party or a potential party thereto, and any fees or expenses
incurred by Indemnitees in enforcing this indemnity), whether direct, indirect
or consequential and whether based on any federal, state or foreign laws,
statutes, rules or regulations (including securities and commercial laws,
statutes, rules or regulations and Environmental Laws), on common law or
equitable cause or on contract or otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against any such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or
arising out of (i) this Agreement or the other Credit Documents and the Chapter
11 Cases (it being understood that such Indemnified Liabilities arising out of
the Chapter 11 Cases shall apply solely to Indemnitees in their capacities as
Agents, Lenders and Issuing Lenders or officers, directors, employees, agents
and affiliates of Agents, Lenders or Issuing Lenders, and not in any other
capacities) or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the
issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder or the use or intended use of any
thereof, the failure of an Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under a Letter of
Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any
present or future de jure or de facto Government Authority, or any enforcement
of any of the Credit Documents (including any sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon any of the Collateral), (ii) the statements contained in the
commitment letter delivered by any Lender with respect thereto, or (iii) any
Environmental Claim or any

                                      128
<PAGE>

Hazardous Materials Activity relating to or arising from, directly or
indirectly, any past or present activity, operation, land ownership, or practice
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including, solely with respect to periods
prior to the Closing Date, CPIH Subsidiaries).

                  To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay
and hold harmless set forth in this subsection 10.3 may be unenforceable in
whole or in part because they are violative of any law or public policy,
Borrowers shall contribute the maximum portion that they are permitted to pay
and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

         10.4     SET-OFF.

                  In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default each Lender
is hereby authorized by each Borrower at any time or from time to time, without
notice to any Borrower or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby
expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all
deposits (general or special, including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates
of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust accounts) and
any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender or any Affiliate
of such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower or any other
Credit Party against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of any
Borrower or any other Credit Party to that Lender (or any Affiliate of such
Lender) or to any other Lender (or any Affiliate of any other Lender) under this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations therein and the other Credit
Documents, including all claims of any nature or description arising out of or
connected with this Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations therein
or any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not (i) any Agent or
any Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (ii) any amounts in respect
of the Letters of Credit or any other amounts due hereunder shall have become
due and payable pursuant to Section 8 and although said obligations and
liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured. Each Borrower
hereby further grants to Administrative Agent and each Lender a security
interest in all deposits and accounts maintained with Administrative Agent or
such Lender as security for the Obligations.

         10.5     RATABLE SHARING.

                  A.       Subject at all times to their obligations under the
Intercreditor Agreement, Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of
them shall, whether by voluntary or involuntary payment, by realization upon
security, through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Credit
Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash
collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a
proportion of the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts
then due and owing to that Lender hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
with respect to the Obligations (collectively, the "AGGREGATE AMOUNTS DUE" to
such Lender) that is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in
respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify Administrative
Agent and each other Lender of the receipt of such payment and (ii) apply a
portion of such payment to purchase assignments

                                      129
<PAGE>

(which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of an assignment
simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment)
of the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of
Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the
Aggregate Amounts Due to them; provided that if all or part of such
proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase
prices paid for such assignments shall be returned to such purchasing Lender
ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each Borrower
expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any purchaser of
an assignment so purchased may exercise any and all rights of a Lender as to
such assignment as fully as if that Lender had complied with the provisions of
subsection 10.1B with respect to such assignment. In order to further evidence
such assignment (and without prejudice to the effectiveness of the assignment
provisions set forth above), each purchasing Lender and each selling Lender
agree to enter into an assignment agreement at the request of a selling Lender
or a purchasing Lender, as the case may be, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to each such Lender and to Administrative Agent.

                  B.       Notwithstanding anything in this subsection 10.5 to
the contrary, in the event any one or more Lenders (for purposes of this
subsection 10.5, "ENFORCING LENDERS") receives any amounts that are subject to
the sharing provisions of subsection 10.5A as a result of such Enforcing Lender
or Enforcing Lenders, but not any Agents or all Lenders, commencing Proceedings
to recover such amounts, no Lender that is not an Enforcing Lender shall be
entitled to the benefits of subsection 10.5A with respect to the amounts
received by such Enforcing Lenders (i) unless and until such Lender has paid its
Pro Rata Share of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses of counsel to such Enforcing Lenders) incurred by such Enforcing
Lenders in connection with such Proceedings or (ii) in any greater amount at any
time than such Lender would be entitled to receive under such subsection if all
Lenders paid their Pro Rata Shares of such costs and expenses.

         10.6     AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.

No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or of the Notes or the Credit Documents, and no consent to any
departure by any Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the
written concurrence of Requisite Lenders; provided that no such amendment,
modification, termination, waiver or consent shall, without the consent of: (a)
each Lender with Obligations directly affected (whose consent shall be required
for any such amendment, modification, termination or waiver in addition to that
of Requisite Lenders) (1) reduce the principal amount of any funded amount with
respect to a participation in a Letter of Credit, (2) increase the maximum
aggregate amount of such Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment or Letters of
Credit, (3) postpone the Maturity Date, (4) postpone the date on which any
interest or any fees are payable, (5) decrease the interest rate borne by any
funded amount with respect to a participation in a Letter of Credit (other than
any waiver of any increase in the interest rate applicable pursuant to
subsection 2.1C, the penultimate sentence of subsection 3.2 or subsection 6.13)
or the amount of any fees payable hereunder, (6) reduce the amount or postpone
the due date of any reimbursement of a drawing (other than from a Mandatory
Payment) in respect of any Letter of Credit, (7) extend the expiration date of
any Letter of Credit beyond the Maturity Date, (8) change in any manner the
obligations of Lenders relating to the purchase of participations in Letters of
Credit, or (9) change in any manner or waive the provisions contained

                                      130
<PAGE>

in subsection 8.1; (b) each Lender, (1) change in any manner the definition of
"Pro Rata Share" or the definition of "Requisite Lenders" (except for any
changes resulting solely from an increase in Letter of Credit Commitments
approved by Requisite Lenders), (2) change in any manner any provision of this
Agreement that, by its terms, expressly requires the approval or concurrence of
all Lenders, (3) release any Lien granted in favor of Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral or
release any substantial portion of Borrowers from their obligations under this
Agreement, in each case other than in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Documents, or (4) change in any manner or waive the provisions contained in
subsection 10.6; (c) Administrative Agent, Documentation Agent and each Issuing
Lender, change in any manner the definition of "Eligible Assignee"; (d)
Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender, change subsection 4.1X or the
obligations of any Lender under subsection 10.1H or subsection 2.6 (and no
consent of Requisite Lenders shall be required for any waiver of the conditions
precedent contained in subsection 4.1X or any waiver of any obligations of a
Lender contained in subsection 10.1H if such waiver is consented to by each
Issuing Lender and Administrative Agent); (e) the relevant Agent, affect the
rights or duties of such Agent (in its capacity as such Agent) under this
Agreement or any other Credit Document; and (f) the relevant Issuing Lender,
affect the rights or duties of such Issuing Lender (in its capacity as an
Issuing Lender) under this Agreement or any other Credit Document.

                  In addition, (i) no amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of Section 3 shall be effective without the written
concurrence of Administrative Agent and Documentation Agent and, with respect to
the purchase of participations in Letters of Credit, without the written
concurrence of each Issuing Lender that has issued an outstanding Letter of
Credit or has not been reimbursed for a payment under a Letter of Credit; (ii)
no amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of Section 9
or of any other provision of this Agreement which, by its terms, expressly
requires the approval or concurrence of Administrative Agent or Documentation
Agent shall be effective without the written concurrence of Administrative Agent
or Documentation Agent, as the case may be; and (iii) no amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement which, by
its terms, expressly requires the approval or concurrence of the applicable
Issuing Lender shall be effective without the written concurrence of such
Issuing Lender. Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with
the concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or
consents on behalf of that Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No
notice to or demand on any Borrower or Borrowers in any case shall entitle any
Borrower or Borrowers to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent
effected in accordance with this subsection 10.6 shall be binding upon each
Lender at the time outstanding, each future Lender and, if signed by Borrowers,
on Borrowers. Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after the effectiveness
of any amendment, termination, supplement, waiver or other modification of this
Agreement it shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each Lender a copy
thereof to the extent such a copy is available to Administrative Agent.

         10.7     INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS.

                  All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so
that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such
covenants, the fact that it would be permitted

                                      131
<PAGE>

by an exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another
covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default or Potential
Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists.

         10.8     NOTICES; EFFECTIVENESS OF SIGNATURES.

                  Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice or
other communication herein required or permitted to be given shall be in writing
and may be personally served, or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail or
courier service or (subject to the following paragraphs in this subsection 10.8)
electronic mail and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered in
person or by courier service, (b) upon receipt of telefacsimile in complete and
legible form, (c) three Business Days after depositing it in the United States
mail with postage prepaid and properly addressed, or (d) in the case of
communications delivered by electronic mail to the extent provided in the
following paragraph, as provided pursuant to such paragraph; provided that
notices to Administrative Agent and any Issuing Lender shall not be effective
until received. For the purposes hereof, the address of each party hereto shall
be as set forth under such party's name on the signature pages hereof or (i) as
to Company and Administrative Agent, such other address as shall be designated
by such Person in a written notice delivered to the other parties hereto and
(ii) as to each other party, such other address as shall be designated by such
party in a written notice delivered to Administrative Agent.

                  Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may
be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and
Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by Administrative
Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender
pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3 hereof if such Lender has notified
Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such
Section by electronic communication. Administrative Agent or any Borrower may,
in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it
hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it,
provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices
or communications.

                  Credit Documents and notices under the Credit Documents may be
transmitted and/or signed by telefacsimile. The effectiveness of any such
documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable law, have the same force
and effect as an original copy with manual signatures and shall be binding on
all Credit Parties, Agents and Lenders. Administrative Agent may also require
that any such documents and signature be confirmed by a manually-signed copy
thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver any such
manually-signed copy shall not affect the effectiveness of any facsimile
document or signature.

         10.9     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS.

                  A.       All representations, warranties and agreements made
herein or in any other Credit Document shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the issuance of the Letters of Credit hereunder.

                  B.       Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied
by law to the contrary, the agreements of Borrowers set forth in subsections
2.4, 3.5A, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.19

                                      132
<PAGE>

and 10.20 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in subsections 9.2C, 9.4,
10.5, 10.19 and 10.20 shall survive the cancellation or expiration of the
Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and the
termination of this Agreement (and the benefits to a Lender of such agreements
of Borrowers shall survive such Lender's ceasing to be a party hereto pursuant
to subsection 10.1B).

         10.10    FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

                  No failure or delay on the part of an Agent or any Lender in
the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to
be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

         10.11    MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.

                  Neither any Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation
to marshal any assets in favor of Company or any other party or against or in
payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that Company makes a
payment or payments to Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to Administrative
Agent for the benefit of Lenders), or Agents or Lenders enforce any security
interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or
the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or
required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any equitable
cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof
originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor
or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as
if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had
not occurred.

         10.12    SEVERABILITY.

                  In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement
shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of
such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

         10.13    OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; INDEPENDENT NATURE OF LENDERS' RIGHTS;
                  DAMAGE WAIVER.

                  The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender
shall be responsible for the obligations or Letter of Credit Commitments of any
other Lender hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other Credit
Document, and no action taken by Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be
deemed to constitute Lenders, or Lenders and Company, as a partnership, an
association, a Joint Venture or any other kind of entity. The amounts payable at
any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and independent debt, and
each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of
this Agreement and it shall not be

                                      133
<PAGE>

necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any
proceeding for such purpose.

                  To the extent permitted by law, each Borrower shall not
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with or as a result
of this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any transaction contemplated by
the Credit Documents, any Letter of Credit or the use of proceeds of drawings
thereunder.

         10.14    RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST.

                  Upon the proposed sale or other disposition of any Collateral
that is permitted by this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise
consented, for which a Credit Party desires to obtain a security interest
release from Collateral Agent, such Credit Party shall deliver to Administrative
Agent and Collateral Agent an Officer's Certificate (i) stating that the
Collateral or the Capital Stock subject to such disposition is being sold or
otherwise disposed of in compliance with the terms hereof and of the Credit
Documents and (ii) specifying the Collateral or Capital Stock being sold or
otherwise disposed of in the proposed transaction. Upon the receipt of such
Officer's Certificate, Collateral Agent shall, at such Credit Party's expense,
so long as Collateral Agent (a) believes in good faith that the facts stated in
such Officer's Certificate are true and correct and (b), if the sale or other
disposition of such item of Collateral or Capital Stock constitutes an Asset
Sale, shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that arrangements
satisfactory to it have been made for delivery of the Net Asset Sale Proceeds if
and as required by subsection 2.3, execute and deliver such releases of its
security interest in such Collateral as may be reasonably requested by such
Credit Party. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this
subsection 10.14 and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement shall prevail.

         10.15    HEADINGS.

                  Section and subsection headings in this Agreement are included
herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this
Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

         10.16    APPLICABLE LAW.

                  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK), WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT
WOULD REQUIRE APPLICATION OF ANOTHER LAW.

COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE, COUNTY AND CITY OF NEW YORK (AS ANY AGENT,
AGENTS, LENDER OR LENDERS BRINGING SUCH ACTION MAY ELECT IN ITS OR THEIR SOLE
DISCRETION). BY EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS AGREEMENT, EACH BORROWER, FOR
ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY

                  (I)      ACCEPTS (AND SUBMITS TO) GENERALLY AND

         PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSECTION 10.8;

                  (IV)     AGREES THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (III) ABOVE
         IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER SUCH BORROWER IN ANY
         SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE
         AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT;

                  (V)      AGREES THAT LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS
         IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
         SUCH BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION; AND

                  (VI)     AGREES THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION 10.18
         RELATING TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE SHALL BE BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE TO

                  EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE
ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON
OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR ANY
DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS CREDIT TRANSACTION
OR THE LENDER/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. The scope of this
waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be
filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction,
including contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other
common law and statutory claims. Each party hereto acknowledges that this waiver
is a material inducement to enter into a business relationship, that each has
already relied on this waiver in entering into this Agreement, and that each
will continue to rely on this waiver in their related future dealings. Each
party hereto further warrants and represents that it has reviewed this waiver
with its legal counsel and that it knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury
trial rights following consultation with legal counsel. THIS WAIVER IS
IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING
(OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SUBSECTION
10.19 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY
TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE CREDIT EXTENDED HEREUNDER. In the event of
litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the
court.

         10.20    CONFIDENTIALITY.

                  Each Lender shall hold all non-public information obtained
pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement that has been identified as
confidential by Company in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures
for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe
and sound banking practices, it being understood and agreed by Borrowers that in
any event a Lender may make (a) disclosures to Affiliates and professional
advisors of such Lender, (b) disclosures reasonably required by (i) any bona
fide assignee, transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated
assignment or transfer by such Lender of any Obligations or any participations
therein, or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap
agreements or such contractual counterparties' professional advisors provided
that such assignee, transferee, participant, contractual counterparty or
professional advisor agrees to keep such information confidential to the same
extent required of Lenders hereunder, (c) disclosures to any court or tribunal
(whether or not pursuant to subpoena) in connection with any action arising out
of or related to this Agreement, or (d) disclosures required or requested by any
Government Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process;
provided that, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order,
each Lender shall notify Company of any request by any Government Authority or
representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with any
examination of such Lender by such Government Authority) for disclosure of any
such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information; and
provided, further that in no event shall any Lender be obligated or

                                      136
<PAGE>

required to return any materials furnished by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including CPIH Subsidiaries).

                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, information
required to be treated as confidential by reason of the foregoing shall not
include, and Administrative Agent, each Lender and the respective Affiliates of
each of the foregoing (and the respective partners, directors, officers,
employees, agents, advisors and other representatives of each of the foregoing
and their respective Affiliates) (collectively, the "LENDER PARTIES") may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, (x) any
information with respect to United States federal and state income tax treatment
and United States federal income tax structure of the transactions contemplated
hereby and any facts that may be relevant to understanding such tax treatment,
which facts shall not include for this purpose the names of the parties or any
other Person named herein, or information that would permit identification of
the parties or such other Persons, or any pricing terms or other non-public
business or financial information that is unrelated to such tax treatment or
facts, and (y) all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) relating to such tax treatment or facts that are provided to any of
the Lender Parties.

         10.21    RELEASE OF PARTIES; WAIVERS.

                  A.       Each Borrower, on behalf of itself and each of its
Subsidiaries, including CPIH Subsidiaries (collectively, the "RELEASORS"),
hereby releases, remises, acquits and forever discharges each Agent, each Lender
(in its capacity as a Lender hereunder and as a lender, collateral agent,
depository or letter of credit issuer and in any other capacity under or in
connection with the Prepetition Credit Documents or the DIP Credit Documents),
each other Prepetition Lender and DIP Lender (in its capacity as a lender,
collateral agent, depository or letter of credit issuer and in any other
capacity under or in connection with the Prepetition Credit Documents or the DIP
Credit Documents), and each of their respective employees, agents,
representatives, consultants, attorneys, fiduciaries, servants, officers,
directors, partners, predecessors, successors and assigns, subsidiary
corporations, parent corporations, related corporate divisions, participants and
assigns (all of the foregoing hereinafter called the "RELEASED PARTIES"), from
any and all actions and causes of action, judgments, executions, suits, debts,
claims, demands, liabilities, obligations, setoffs, recoupments, counterclaims,
defenses, damages and expenses of any and every character, known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, direct and/or indirect, at law or in equity, of
whatsoever kind or nature, whether heretofore or hereafter arising, for or
because of any matter or things done, omitted or suffered to be done by any of
the Released Parties prior to and including the date of execution hereof, and in
any way directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way connected to this
Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents, the Prepetition Credit Documents,
and DIP Credit Documents or the administration or enforcement of any of such
documents (all of the foregoing hereinafter called the "RELEASED MATTERS"). Each
Releasor acknowledges that the agreements in this subsection are intended to be
in full satisfaction of all or any alleged injuries or damages suffered or
incurred by such Releasor arising in connection with the Released Matters and
constitute a complete waiver of any right of setoff or recoupment, counterclaim
or defense of any nature whatsoever which arose prior to the Closing Date to
payment or performance of the Obligations. Each Releasor represents and warrants
that it has no knowledge of any claim by it against the Released Parties or of
any facts, or acts or omissions of the Released Parties which on the date hereof
would be the basis of a claim by the Releasors against the Released Parties
which is not

                                      137
<PAGE>

released hereby. Each Releasor represents and warrants that it has not purported
to transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise convey any of its right, title or
interest in any Released Matter to any other person or entity and that the
foregoing constitutes a full and complete release of all Released Matters.
Releasors have granted this release freely, and voluntarily and without duress.

         10.22    NO FIDUCIARY DUTY.

                  No Agent nor any Lender has or shall have, by reason of this
Agreement or any of the Credit Documents, a fiduciary relationship in respect
of, or a fiduciary duty to, any Borrower, Borrowers, any other Credit Party or
Credit Parties, and the relationship between Administrative Agent, the other
Agents and Lenders, on one hand, and each Borrower, on the other hand, in
connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor.

         10.23    COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS.

                  This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or
supplements hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument;
signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached
to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to
the same document. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of a
counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto.

         10.24    NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES

                  Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees and Released Parties related to Agents, and
Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.
