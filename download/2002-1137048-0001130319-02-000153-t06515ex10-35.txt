To the Purchasers listed in
  the attached Schedule A:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     Odyssey Re Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), agrees
with the purchasers listed in the attached Schedule A (the "Purchasers") as
follows:

SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF NOTES.

     The Company will authorize the issue and sale of $100,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of its 7.49% Senior Notes due November 30, 2006 (the "Notes,"
such term to include any such notes issued in substitution therefor pursuant to
Section 13 of this Agreement). The Notes shall be substantially in the form set
out in Exhibit 1, with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by the
Purchasers and the Company. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are
defined in Schedule B; references to a "Schedule" or an "Exhibit" are, unless
otherwise specified, to a Schedule or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement.

SECTION 2. SALE AND PURCHASE OF NOTES.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will
issue and sell to each Purchaser and each Purchaser will purchase from the
Company, at the Closing provided for in Section 3, Notes in the principal amount
specified opposite such Purchaser's name in Schedule A at the purchase price of
100% of the principal amount thereof. Each Purchaser's obligations hereunder are
several and not joint and no Purchaser shall have any obligation or liability to
any Person for the performance or nonperformance by any other Purchaser
hereunder.

SECTION 3. CLOSING.

     The sale and purchase of the Notes to be purchased by the Purchasers shall
occur at the offices of Chapman and Cutler, 111 West Monroe Street, Chicago,
Illinois 60603, at 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, at a closing (the "Closing") on
December 4, 2001 or on such other Business Day thereafter on or prior to
December 7, 2001 as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Purchasers. At the
Closing, the Company will deliver to each Purchaser the Notes to be purchased by
such Purchaser in the form of a single Note (or such greater number of Notes in
denominations of at least $100,000 as such Purchaser may request) dated the date
of the Closing and registered in such Purchaser's name (or in the name of its
nominee), against delivery by such Purchaser to the Company or its order of
immediately available funds in the amount of the purchase price therefor by wire
transfer of immediately available funds for the account of the Company. If at
the Closing the Company shall fail to tender such Notes to any Purchaser as
provided above in this Section 3, or any of the conditions specified in Section
4 shall not have been fulfilled to any Purchaser's satisfaction, such Purchaser
shall, at its election, be relieved of all further obligations under this
Agreement, without thereby waiving any rights such Purchaser may have by reason
of such failure or such nonfulfillment.

SECTION 4. CONDITIONS TO CLOSING.

     Each Purchaser's obligation to purchase and pay for the Notes to be sold to
such Purchaser at the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to such Purchaser's
satisfaction, prior to or at the Closing, of the following conditions:

          Section 4.1.  Representations and Warranties.  The representations and
     warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall be correct when made and
     at the time of the Closing.

          Section 4.2.  Performance; No Default.  The Company shall have
     performed and complied with all agreements and conditions contained in this
     Agreement required to be performed or complied with by it
<PAGE>

     prior to or at the Closing, and after giving effect to the issue and sale
     of the Notes (and the application of the proceeds thereof as contemplated
     by Schedule 5.14), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
     be continuing. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall have entered
     into any transaction since the date of the Memorandum that would have been
     prohibited by Section 10 had such Section applied since such date.

          Section 4.3. Compliance Certificates.

             (a) Officer's Certificate.  The Company shall have delivered to
        such Purchaser an Officer's Certificate, dated the date of the Closing,
        certifying that the conditions specified in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.9
        have been fulfilled.

             (b) Secretary's Certificate.  The Company shall have delivered to
        such Purchaser a certificate certifying as to the resolutions attached
        thereto and other corporate proceedings relating to the authorization,
        execution and delivery of the Notes and this Agreement.

          Section 4.4. Opinions of Counsel.  Such Purchaser shall have received
     opinions in form and substance satisfactory to such Purchaser, dated the
     date of the Closing (a) from Shearman & Sterling, counsel for the Company,
     covering the matters set forth in Exhibit 4.4(a) and covering such other
     matters incident to the transactions contemplated hereby as such Purchaser
     or special counsel to the Travelers Purchasers may reasonably request (and
     the Company hereby instructs its counsel to deliver such opinion to such
     Purchaser), (b) from Donald L. Smith, Esq., General Counsel to the Company,
     covering the matters set forth in Exhibit 4.4(b) and covering such other
     matters incident to the transactions contemplated hereby as such Purchaser
     or special counsel to the Travelers Purchasers may reasonably request and
     (c) in the case of Zenith Insurance Company and the Travelers Purchasers,
     from Chapman and Cutler, special counsel to the Travelers Purchasers, in
     connection with such transactions, substantially in the form set forth in
     Exhibit 4.4(c) and covering such other matters incident to such
     transactions as such Travelers Purchaser may reasonably request.

          Section 4.5. Purchase Permitted by Applicable Law, Etc.  On the date
     of the Closing, such Purchaser's purchase of Notes shall (a) be permitted
     by the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction to which such Purchaser is
     subject, without recourse to provisions (such as Section 1405(a)(8) of the
     New York Insurance Law) permitting limited investments by insurance
     companies without restriction as to the character of the particular
     investment, (b) not violate any applicable law or regulation (including,
     without limitation, Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the
     Federal Reserve System) and (c) not subject such Purchaser to any tax,
     penalty or liability under or pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
     If requested by such Purchaser, such Purchaser shall have received an
     Officer's Certificate certifying as to such matters of fact as such
     Purchaser may reasonably specify to enable it to determine whether such
     purchase is so permitted.

          Section 4.6. Related Transactions.  The Company shall have consummated
     the sale of the entire principal amount of the Notes scheduled to be sold
     on the date of the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

          Section 4.7. Payment of Special Counsel Fees.  Without limiting the
     provisions of Section 15.1, the Company shall have paid on or before the
     Closing the fees, charges and disbursements of special counsel to the
     Travelers Purchasers and original drafting counsel referred to in Section
     4.4 to the extent reflected in a statement of such counsel rendered to the
     Company no later than 12:00 noon Chicago time one Business Day prior to the
     Closing.

          Section 4.8. Private Placement Number.  A Private Placement number
     issued by Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau (in cooperation with the
     Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance
     Commissioners) shall have been obtained for the Notes.

          Section 4.9. Changes in Corporate Structure.  Except as specified in
     Schedule 4.9, the Company shall not have changed its jurisdiction of
     incorporation or been a party to any merger or consolidation and shall not
     have succeeded to all or any substantial part of the liabilities of any
     other entity, at any time following the date of the most recent financial
     statements referred to in Schedule 5.5.

                                        2
<PAGE>

          Section 4.10. Funding Instructions.  At least three Business Days
     prior to the date of the Closing, such Purchaser shall have received
     written instructions executed by an authorized financial officer of the
     Company directing the manner of the payment of funds and setting forth (a)
     the name of the transferee bank, (b) such transferee bank's ABA number, (c)
     the account name and number into which the purchase price for the Notes is
     to be deposited and (d) the name and telephone number of the account
     representative responsible for verifying receipt of such funds.

          Section 4.11. Proceedings and Documents.  All corporate and other
     proceedings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement and all documents and instruments incident to such transactions
     shall be satisfactory to such Purchaser and special counsel to the
     Travelers Purchasers, and such Purchaser and special counsel to the
     Travelers Purchasers shall have received all such counterpart originals or
     certified or other copies of such documents as such Purchaser or special
     counsel to the Travelers Purchasers may reasonably request.

SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.

     The Company represents and warrants to each Purchaser that:

          Section 5.1. Organization; Power and Authority.  The Company is a
     corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
     laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is duly qualified as a
     foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
     such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to
     which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or
     hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to
     transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and
     deliver this Agreement and the Notes and to perform the provisions hereof
     and thereof.

          Section 5.2. Authorization, Etc.  This Agreement and the Notes have
     been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
     Company, and this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery
     thereof each Note will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of
     the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
     except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
     enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of
     equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
     proceeding in equity or at law).

          Section 5.3. Disclosure.  The Company, through its lead agent, Banc of
     America Securities LLC, has delivered to each Purchaser a copy of a Private
     Placement Memorandum, dated October 2001 and various enclosures related
     thereto (collectively, the "Memorandum"), relating to the transactions
     contemplated hereby. The Memorandum fairly describes, in all material
     respects, the general nature of the business and principal properties of
     the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.3, this
     Agreement, the Memorandum, the documents, certificates or other writings
     delivered to the Purchasers by or on behalf of the Company in connection
     with the transactions contemplated hereby and the financial statements
     listed in Schedule 5.5, taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
     to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances
     under which they were made. Except as disclosed in the Memorandum or as
     expressly described in Schedule 5.3, or in one of the documents,
     certificates or other writings identified therein, or in the financial
     statements listed in Schedule 5.5, since December 31, 2000, there has been
     no change in the financial condition, operations, business, properties or
     prospects of the Company or any Subsidiary except changes that,
     individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have
     a Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact known to the Company that could
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been
     set forth herein or in the Memorandum or in the other documents,
     certificates and other writings delivered to the Purchasers by or on behalf
     of the Company specifically for use in connection with the transactions
     contemplated hereby.

             (a) Schedule 5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and
        correct lists (1) of the Company's Subsidiaries, showing, as to each
        Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its
        organization, and the percentage of shares of each class of its capital
        stock or similar equity interests outstanding owned by the Company and
        each other Subsidiary, (2) of the Company's Affiliates, other than
        Subsidiaries, and (3) of the Company's directors and senior officers.

             (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar
        equity interests of each Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned
        by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully
        paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company or another
        Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien (except as otherwise disclosed in
        Schedule 5.4).

             (c) Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation or
        other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
        under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly
        qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good
        standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by
        law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so
        qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the
        aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
        Each such Subsidiary has the corporate or other power and authority to
        own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under
        lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to
        transact.

             (d) No Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to any legal
        restriction or any agreement (other than this Agreement, the agreements
        listed on Schedule 5.4 and customary limitations imposed by corporate
        law and insurance regulatory statutes) restricting the ability of such
        Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar
        distributions of profits to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
        owns outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of
        such Subsidiary.

          Section 5.5. Financial Statements.  The Company has delivered to each
     Purchaser copies of the financial statements of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.5. All of said financial statements
     (including in each case the related schedules and notes) fairly present, in
     all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company
     and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates specified in such Schedule
     and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
     respective periods so specified and have been prepared in accordance with
     GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except as set
     forth in the notes thereto (subject, in the case of any interim financial
     statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

          Section 5.6. Compliance with Laws, Other Instruments, Etc.  The
     execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and
     the Notes will not (a) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a
     default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any
     property of the Company or any Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage,
     deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate charter
     or by-laws, or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company or
     any Subsidiary is bound or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any of
     their respective properties may be bound or affected, (b) conflict with or
     result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
     order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental
     Authority applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or (c) violate any
     provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any Governmental
     Authority applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary.

          Section 5.7. Governmental Authorizations, Etc.  No consent, approval
     or authorization of, or registration, filing or declaration with, any
     Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution,
     delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement or the Notes.

          Section 5.8. Litigation; Observance of Agreements, Statutes and
     Orders.

             (a) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8, there are no actions,
        suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
        threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any
        property of the Company or any Subsidiary in any court or before any
        arbitrator of any kind or

                                        4
<PAGE>

        before or by any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the
        aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
        Effect.

             (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under any
        term of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which
        it is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court,
        arbitrator or Governmental Authority or is in violation of any
        applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including, without
        limitation, Environmental Laws) of any Governmental Authority, which
        default or violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
        be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 5.9. Taxes.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all
     tax returns that are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and
     have paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all
     other taxes and assessments levied upon them or their properties, assets,
     income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become
     due and payable and before they have become delinquent, except for any
     taxes and assessments (a) the amount of which is not, individually or in
     the aggregate, Material or (b) the amount, applicability or validity of
     which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
     and with respect to which the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be,
     has established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP. The Company
     knows of no basis for any other tax or assessment that could reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and
     reserves on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of
     Federal, state or other taxes for all fiscal periods are adequate. The
     Federal income tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries have
     been determined by the Internal Revenue Service and paid for all fiscal
     years up to and including the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997.

     in Section 5.5 or purported to have been acquired by the Company or any
     Subsidiary after said date (except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the
     ordinary course of business), in each case free and clear of Liens
     prohibited by this Agreement. All leases that, individually or in the
     aggregate, are Material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and
     effect in all material respects.

          Section 5.11. Licenses, Permits, Etc.  Except as disclosed in Schedule
     5.11.

             (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries own, possess or are licensed
        to use all licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents,
        copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade names and domain names, or
        rights thereto, that, individually or in the aggregate, are Material,
        without known material conflict with the rights of others;

             (b) to the best knowledge of the Company, no product of the Company
        infringes in any material respect any license, permit, franchise,
        authorization, patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name,
        domain name or other right owned by any other Person; and

             (c) to the best knowledge of the Company, there is no Material
        violation by any Person of any right of the Company or any of its
        Subsidiaries with respect to any patent, copyright, service mark,
        trademark, trade name, domain name or other right owned or used by the
        Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

          Section 5.12. Compliance with ERISA.

             (a) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and
        administered each employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of
        ERISA) in compliance with all applicable laws except for such instances
        of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably be
        expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
        any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV
        of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to
        employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), and no
        event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could
        reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any such liability
        by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien
        on any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA
        Affiliate, in either case pursuant to
                                        5
<PAGE>

        Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax provisions or to
        Section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other than such liabilities or
        Liens as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
        expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

             (b) The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under
        each of the Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined as of the
        end of such Plan's most recently ended plan year on the basis of the
        actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plan's most
        recent actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current
        value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities
        by more than $1,000,000 in the aggregate for all Plans.

             The term "benefit liabilities" has the meaning specified in Section
        4001 of ERISA and the terms "current value" and "present value" have the
        meanings specified in Section 3 of ERISA.

             (c) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred
        withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal
        liabilities) under Section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of
        Multiemployer Plans that could, individually or in the aggregate,
        reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

             (d) The expected post-retirement benefit obligation (determined as
        of the last day of the Company's most recently ended fiscal year in
        accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106,
        without regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage
        mandated by Section 4980B of the Code) of the Company and its
        Subsidiaries is not Material.

             (e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance
        and sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any transaction that is
        subject to the prohibitions of Section 406(a) of ERISA or in connection
        with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to Section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D)
        of the Code. The representation by the Company in the first sentence of
        this Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance upon and subject to the
        accuracy of each Purchaser's representation in Section 6.2 as to the
        sources of the funds used to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be
        purchased by such Purchaser, and is made only as of the date each
        Purchaser's representation in Section 6.2 is made.

          Section 5.13. Private Offering by the Company.  Neither the Company
     nor anyone acting on its behalf has offered the Notes or any similar
     securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the same from,
     or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with, any Person
     other than the Purchasers and not more than seventy-five (75) other
     Institutional Investors of the type described in clause (c) of the
     definition thereof, each of which has been offered the Notes at a private
     sale for investment. Neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf
     has taken, or will take, any action that would subject the issuance or sale
     of the Notes to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the
     Securities Act.

          Section 5.14. Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations.  The Company will
     apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes as set forth in Schedule 5.14.
     No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be used,
     directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin
     stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the
     Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 221), or for the purpose of buying or
     carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to
     involve the Company in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR
     224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of
     said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin stock does not constitute more than 0% of
     the value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
     and the Company does not have any present intention that margin stock will
     constitute more than 0% of the value of such assets. As used in this
     Section, the terms "margin stock" and "purpose of buying or carrying" shall
     have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.

          Section 5.15. Existing Indebtedness; Future Liens.

             (a) Except as described therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a
        complete and correct list of all outstanding Debt of the Company and its
        Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2001, since which date there has been
        no Material change in the amounts, interest rates, sinking funds,
        installment payments or maturities of the Debt of the Company or its
        Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
                                        6
<PAGE>

        any Subsidiary is in default and no waiver of default is currently in
        effect, in the payment of any principal or interest on any Debt of the
        Company or such Subsidiary and no event or condition exists with respect
        to any Debt of the Company or any Subsidiary that would permit (or that
        with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more
        Persons to cause such Debt to (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15,
        neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause
        or permit in the future (upon the happening of a contingency or
        otherwise) any of its property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired,
        to be subject to a Lien not permitted by Section 10.4.

          Section 5.16. Foreign Assets Control Regulations, Etc.  Neither the
     sale of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use of the proceeds
     thereof will violate the Anti-Terrorism Order, the Trading with the Enemy
     Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets control regulations of the
     United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as
     amended) or any enabling legislation or executive order relating thereto.

          Section 5.17. Status under Certain Statutes.  Neither the Company nor
     any Subsidiary is required to be registered under the Investment Company
     Act of 1940, as amended, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
     amended, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, as amended, or the Federal Power
     Act, as amended.

          Section 5.18. Environmental Matters.  Neither the Company nor any
     Subsidiary has knowledge of any claim or has received any notice of any
     claim, and no proceeding has been instituted raising any claim against the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective real
     properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or
     other assets, alleging any damage to the environment or violation of any
     Environmental Laws, except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be
     expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise
     disclosed to the Purchasers in writing:

             (a) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has knowledge of any
        facts which would give rise to any claim, public or private, of
        violation of Environmental Laws or damage to the environment emanating
        from, occurring on or in any way related to real properties now or
        formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or to other assets or
        their use, except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be
        expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

             (b) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has stored any
        Hazardous Materials on real properties now or formerly owned, leased or
        operated by any of them or has disposed of any Hazardous Materials in a
        manner contrary to any Environmental Laws in each case in any manner
        that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
        Effect; and (c) all buildings on all real properties now owned, leased
        or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in compliance
        with applicable Environmental Laws, except where failure to comply could
        not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 5.19. Notes Rank Pari Passu.  The obligations of the Company
     under this Agreement and the Notes rank at least pari passu in right of
     payment with all other Senior Debt (actual or contingent) of the Company,
     including, without limitation, all Senior Debt of the Company described in
     Schedule 5.15.

SECTION 6. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASERS.

          Section 6.1. Purchase for Investment.  Each Purchaser represents that
     it is an Institutional Accredited Investor. Each Purchaser further

     circumstances where neither such registration nor such an exemption is
     required by law, and that the Company is not required to register the
     Notes.

        employee benefit plans established or maintained by the same employer or
        by an affiliate (within the meaning of Section V(c)(1) of the QPAM
        Exemption) of such employer or by the same employee organization and
        managed by such QPAM, exceed 20% of the total client assets managed by

SECTION 8. PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES.

          Section 8.1. Required Prepayments.

             (a) The Notes shall not be subject to any required prepayment prior
        to the final maturity thereof.

             (b) On the maturity date of the Notes, the Company will pay the
        then outstanding principal amount of Notes together with interest
        accrued thereon.

          Section 8.2. Optional Prepayments with Make-Whole Amount.  The Company
     may, at its option, upon notice as provided below, prepay at any time all,
     or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an amount not less than
     $1,000,000 of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
     in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of the principal amount so
     prepaid, plus the Make-Whole Amount, if any, determined for the prepayment
     date with respect to such principal amount. The Company will give each
     holder of Notes written notice of each optional prepayment under this
     Section 8.2 not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the
     date fixed for such prepayment. Each such notice shall specify such date,
     the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid on such date, the
     principal amount of each Note held by such holder to be prepaid (determined
     in accordance with Section 8.4), and the interest to be paid on the
     prepayment date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid, and
     shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer as to
     the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such prepayment
     (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of the prepayment),
     setting forth the details of such computation. Two Business Days prior to
     such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes a
     certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of
     such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified prepayment date.

          Section 8.3. Prepayment of Notes upon Change in Control.

             (a) Notice of Change in Control.  The Company will, within 15
        Business Days after any Responsible Officer has knowledge of the
        occurrence of any Change in Control or Control Event, give written
        notice of such Change in Control or Control Event to each holder of
        Notes unless notice in respect of such Change in Control (or Change in
        Control contemplated by such Control Event) shall have been given
        pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 8.3. If a Change in Control
        has occurred, such notice shall contain and constitute an offer to
        prepay Notes as described in paragraph (c) of this Section 8.3 and shall
        be accompanied by the certificate described in paragraph (g) of this
        Section 8.3.

             (b) Condition to Company Action.  The Company will not take any
        action that consummates or finalizes a Change in Control unless (1) at
        least 30 days prior to such action it shall have given to each holder of
        Notes written notice containing and constituting an offer to prepay
        Notes as described in paragraph (c) of this Section 8.3, accompanied by
        the certificate described in paragraph (g) of this Section 8.3, and (2)
        contemporaneously with such action, it prepays all Notes required to be
        prepaid in accordance with this Section 8.3.

             (c) Offer to Prepay Notes.  The offer to prepay Notes contemplated
        by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 8.3 shall be an offer to
        prepay, in accordance with and subject to this

                                        11
<PAGE>

        Section 8.3, all, but not less than all, the Notes held by each holder
        (in this case only, "holder" in respect of any Note registered in the
        name of a nominee for a disclosed beneficial owner shall mean such
        beneficial owner) on a date specified in such offer (the "Proposed
        Prepayment Date"). If such Proposed Prepayment Date is in connection
        with an offer contemplated by paragraph (a) of this Section 8.3, such
        date shall be not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days after the
        date of such offer (if the Proposed Prepayment Date shall not be
        specified in such offer, the Proposed Prepayment Date shall be the
        thirtieth day after the date of such offer). If such Proposed Prepayment
        Date is in connection with an offer contemplated by paragraph (b) of
        this Section 8.3, such date shall be the proposed date of the Change in
        Control.

             (d) Acceptance/Rejection.  A holder of Notes may accept or reject
        the offer to prepay Notes made pursuant to this Section 8.3 by causing a
        notice of such acceptance or rejection to be delivered to the Company
        within 15 Business Days after receipt of the notice specified in
        paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) above; provided that if such Proposed
        Prepayment Date shall be deferred pursuant to paragraph (f) of this
        Section 8.3 for more than 10 Business Days, then any acceptance of an
        offer may be rescinded by a holder by written notice delivered to the
        Company not less than three days prior to any deferred prepayment date.
        A failure by a holder of Notes to respond to an offer to prepay made
        pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be deemed to constitute a rejection
        of such offer by such holder.

             (e) Prepayment.  Prepayment of the Notes to be prepaid pursuant to
        this Section 8.3 shall be at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes,
        together with interest on such Notes accrued to the date of prepayment
        but without any premium. The prepayment shall be made on the Proposed
        Prepayment Date except as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section 8.3.

             (f) Deferral Pending Change in Control.  The obligation of the
        Company to prepay Notes pursuant to the offers required by paragraph (b)
        and accepted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section 8.3 is
        subject to the occurrence of the Change in Control in respect of which
        such offers and acceptances shall have been made. In the event that such
        Change in Control does not occur on the Proposed Prepayment Date in
        respect thereof, the prepayment shall be deferred until, and shall be
        made on the date on which, such Change in Controls occurs. The Company
        shall keep each holder of Notes reasonably and timely informed of (1)
        any such deferral of the date of prepayment, (2) the date on which such
        Change in Control and the prepayment are expected to occur and (3) any
        determination by the Company that efforts to effect such Change in
        Control have ceased or been abandoned (in which case the offers and
        acceptances made pursuant to this Section 8.3 in respect of such Change
        in Control shall be deemed rescinded).

             (g) Officer's Certificate.  Each offer to prepay the Notes pursuant
        to this Section 8.3 shall be accompanied by a certificate, executed by a
        Senior Financial Officer of the Company and dated the date of such
        offer, specifying: (1) the Proposed Prepayment Date; (2) that such offer
        is made pursuant to this Section 8.3; (3) the principal amount of each
        Note offered to be prepaid; (4) the interest that would be due on each
        Note offered to be prepaid, accrued to the Proposed Prepayment Date; (5)
        that the conditions of this Section 8.3 have been fulfilled; and (6) in
        reasonable detail, the nature and date or proposed date of the Change in
        Control.

             (h) Change in Control Defined.  "Change in Control" shall be deemed
        to have occurred if any Person or Persons acting in concert (other than
        Fairfax), together with Affiliates thereof, shall in the aggregate,
        directly or indirectly, control or own (beneficially or otherwise) more
        than 50% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company.

             (i) Control Event Defined.  "Control Event" shall mean:

                (1) the execution by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
           Affiliates of any agreement or letter of intent with respect to any
           proposed transaction or event or series of transactions or events
           which, individually or in the aggregate, may reasonably be expected
           to result in a Change in Control,

                                        12
<PAGE>

                (2) the execution of any written agreement which, when fully
           performed by the parties thereto, would result in a Change in
           Control, or

                (3) the making of any written offer by any person (as such term
           is used in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act as
           in effect on the date of the Closing) or related persons constituting
           a group (as such term is used in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d)(2)
           of the Exchange Act as in effect on the date of the Closing) to the
           holders of the common stock of the Company, which offer, if accepted
           by the requisite number of holders, would result in a Change in
           Control.

          Section 8.4. Allocation of Partial Prepayments.  In the case of each
     partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2, the principal
     amount of the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes
     at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the
     respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for
     prepayment.

          Section 8.5. Maturity; Surrender, Etc.  In the case of each prepayment
     of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the principal amount of each Note to
     be prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for
     such prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to
     such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any. From and after such
     date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when so
     due and payable, together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount, if any,
     as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall cease to accrue. Any
     Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and
     cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of
     any prepaid principal amount of any Note.

          Section 8.6. Purchase of Notes.  The Company will not, and will not
     permit any Subsidiary to, purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire,
     directly or indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except upon the
     payment or prepayment of the Notes in accordance with the terms of this
     Agreement and the Notes. The Company will promptly cancel all Notes
     acquired by it or any Subsidiary pursuant to any payment, prepayment or
     purchase of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes
     may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.

          Section 8.7. Make-Whole Amount.  The term "Make-Whole Amount" means,
     with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
     Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the
     Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal,
     provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For
     the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have
     the following meanings:

             "Called Principal" shall mean, with respect to any Note, the
        principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or
        has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to
        Section 12.1, as the context requires.

             "Discounted Value" shall mean, with respect to the Called Principal
        of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled
        Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective
        scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
        Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a
        discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which
        interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with
        respect to such Called Principal.

             "Reinvestment Yield" shall mean, with respect to the Called
        Principal of any Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by (a)
        the yields reported, as of 10:00 a.m. (New York, New York time) on the
        second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such
        Called Principal, on the display designated as "Page PX1" on the
        Bloomberg Financial Services Screen (or such other display as may
        replace Page PX1 on the Bloomberg Financial Services Screen) for
        actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the
        Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement
        Date, or (b) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the
        yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable, the Treasury
        Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which
        such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day
        preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called

                                        13
<PAGE>

        Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any
        comparable successor publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury
        securities having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average
        Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such implied
        yield will be determined, if necessary, by (1) converting U.S. Treasury
        bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted
        financial practice and (2) interpolating linearly between (i) the
        actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and
        greater than the Remaining Average Life and (ii) the actively traded
        U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and less than the
        Remaining Average Life.

             "Remaining Average Life" shall mean, with respect to any Called
        Principal, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth
        year) obtained by dividing (a) such Called Principal into (b) the sum of
        the products obtained by multiplying (1) the principal component of each
        Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (2)
        the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) that
        will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
        Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled
        Payment.

             "Remaining Scheduled Payments" shall mean, with respect to the
        Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and
        interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with
        respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal
        were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such
        Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be
        made under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next
        succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of
        interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such
        Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or 12.1.

             "Settlement Date" shall mean, with respect to the Called Principal
        of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid
        pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately
        due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

SECTION 9. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

     The Company covenants that so long as any of the Notes are outstanding:

          Section 9.1. Compliance with Law.  The Company will, and will cause
     each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, ordinances or
     governmental rules or regulations to which each of them is subject,
     including, without limitation, Environmental Laws, and will obtain and
     maintain in effect all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and
     other governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership of their
     respective properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses, in
     each case to the extent necessary to ensure that non-compliance with such
     laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations or failures to obtain
     or maintain in effect such licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and
     other governmental authorizations could not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 9.2. Insurance.  The Company will, and will cause each of its
     Subsidiaries to, maintain, with insurers reasonably determined by the
     Company in good faith to be financially sound and reputable, insurance with
     respect to their respective properties and businesses against such
     casualties and contingencies, of such types, on such terms and in such
     amounts (including deductibles, co-insurance and self-insurance, if
     adequate reserves are maintained with respect thereto) as is customary in
     the case of entities of established reputations engaged in the same or a
     similar business and similarly situated.

          Section 9.3. Maintenance of Properties.  The Company will, and will
     cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain and keep, or cause to be
     maintained and kept, their respective properties in good repair, working
     order and condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the
     business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at
     all times, provided that this Section shall not prevent the Company or any
     Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and the maintenance of any of
     its properties if such discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its
     business and the Company has concluded that such discontinuance could not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect.

                                        14

          Section 9.4. Payment of Taxes and Claims.  The Company will, and will
     cause each of its Subsidiaries to, file all tax returns required to be
     filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be
     due and payable on such returns and all other taxes, assessments,
     governmental charges, or levies imposed on them or any of their properties,
     assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have
     become due and payable and before they have become delinquent and all
     claims for which sums have become due and payable that have or might become
     a Lien on properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, provided
     that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary need pay any such tax or
     assessment or claims if (a) the amount, applicability or validity thereof
     is contested by the Company or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good
     faith and in appropriate proceedings, and the Company or such Subsidiary
     has established adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on the
     books of the Company or such Subsidiary or (b) the nonpayment of all such
     taxes and assessments in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 9.5. Corporate Existence, Etc.  The Company will at all times
     preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence. Subject
     to Sections 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7, the Company will at all times preserve and
     keep in full force and effect the corporate existence of each of its
     Subsidiaries (unless merged into the Company or a Subsidiary) and all
     rights and franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless, in the
     good faith judgment of the Company, the termination of or failure to
     preserve and keep in full force and effect such corporate existence, right
     or franchise could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
     Adverse Effect.

        are enforceable in accordance with their terms and comply with the terms
        hereof;

             (c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default
        or Event of Default would exist.

          No such conveyance, transfer or lease of substantially all of the
     assets of the Company shall have the effect of releasing the Company or any
     Successor Corporation from its liability under this Agreement or the Notes.

          Section 10.6. Sale of Assets, Etc.  Except as permitted under Section
     10.5 and Section 10.7, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its
     Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

             (a) in the good faith opinion of the Company, the Asset Disposition
        is in exchange for consideration having a Fair Market Value at least
        equal to that of the property exchanged and is in the best interest of
        the Company or such Subsidiary;

             (b) immediately after giving effect to the Asset Disposition, no
        Default or Event of Default would exist; and

        Disposition occurring in the then current fiscal year of the Company
        would not exceed 10% of Consolidated Total Assets as of the end of the
        then most recently ended fiscal year of the Company.

          If the Net Proceeds Amount for any Transfer is applied to (1) a Debt
     Prepayment Application, (2) a Property Reinvestment Application or (3) to
     make payment of claims under policies of reinsurance underwritten by any
     Subsidiary, in each case within 180 days after such Transfer, then such
     Transfer, only for the purpose of determining compliance with subsection
     (c) of this Section 10.6 as of a date on or after the Net Proceeds Amount
     is so applied, shall be deemed not to be an Asset Disposition.

          Section 10.7. Disposal of Ownership of a Subsidiary.  The Company will
     not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, sell or otherwise
     dispose of any shares of Subsidiary Stock, nor will the Company permit any

        Company owned by the Company and its other Subsidiaries, provided such
        Transfer satisfies the requirements of Section 10.6 hereof.

          Section 10.8. Investments in Fairfax.  The Company will not, and will
     not permit any of the Subsidiaries to, make or authorize any Investments in
     Fairfax or any Affiliate of Fairfax (other than the Company or any
     Subsidiary of the Company), unless immediately after giving effect to such
     action, (a) the aggregate value of all then outstanding Investments of the
     Company and its Subsidiaries in Fairfax made or authorized on or after the
     date of the Closing (valued immediately after such action) would not exceed
     $25,000,000, (b) the aggregate value of all then outstanding Investments of
     the Company and its Subsidiaries in any such Affiliate of Fairfax made or
     authorized on or after the date of the Closing (valued immediately after
     such action) would not exceed $25,000,000, provided that for purposes of
     this clause (b), the purchase by Odyssey Reinsurance Corporation of
     1,000,000 shares of Zenith National Insurance Corp. for an amount not
     exceeding $25,000,000 pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated as of

     National Insurance Corp. shall be deemed to have been made and authorized
     prior to the date of the Closing and (c) no Default or Event of Default
     would exist.

          Each Person which becomes a Subsidiary of the Company after the date
     of the Closing will be deemed to have made, on the date such Person becomes
     a Subsidiary of the Company, all Investments of such Person in Fairfax and
     any Affiliates of Fairfax in existence on such date. The Company and each
     Subsidiary will be deemed to have made, on the date any Person becomes an
     Affiliate of Fairfax after the date of the Closing, all Investments of the
     Company or such Subsidiary in such Person in existence on such date.
     Investments in any Person that ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company
     after the date of the Closing (but remains an Affiliate of Fairfax and in
     which the Company or another Subsidiary continues to maintain an
     Investment) will be deemed to have been made on the date on which such
     Person ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company.

          Section 10.9. Nature of Business.  The Company will not, and will not
     permit any of its Subsidiaries to, engage in any business if, as a result,
     the general nature of the business in which the Company and its
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would then be engaged would be
     substantially changed from the general nature of the business in which the
     Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are engaged on the date of
     the Closing as described in the Memorandum.

          Section 10.10. Transactions with Affiliates.  The Company will not,
     and will not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into directly or indirectly
     any Material transaction or Material group of related transactions
     (including, without limitation, the purchase, lease, sale or exchange of
     properties of any kind or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate
     (other than the Company or another Subsidiary),
                                        18
<PAGE>

     except in the ordinary course and pursuant to the reasonable requirements
     of the Company's or such Subsidiary's business and upon fair and reasonable
     terms no less favorable to the Company or such Subsidiary than would be
     obtainable in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a Person not an
     Affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to the other terms of
     this Agreement, (a) the Company or any Subsidiary may enter into any
     transaction with an Affiliate that is expressly provided for by the
     Investment Management Agreements and the Investment Administration
     Agreements and (b) the Company may, at any time, prepay the Fairfax Debt so
     long as immediately prior to such prepayment and after giving effect
     thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall exist.

events shall occur and be continuing:

          (a) the Company defaults in the payment of any principal or Make-Whole

     of such default and (2) the Company receiving written notice of such
     default from any holder of a Note (any such written notice to be identified
     as a "notice of default" and to refer specifically to this paragraph (d) of
     Section 11); or

          (e) any representation or warranty made in writing by or on behalf of
     the Company or by any officer of the Company in this Agreement or in any

     Debt has become, or has been declared (or one or more Persons are entitled
     to declare such Debt to be), due and payable before its stated maturity or
     before its regularly scheduled dates of payment or (3) as a consequence of
     the occurrence or continuation of any event or condition (other than the
     passage of time or the right of the holder of Debt to convert such Debt
     into equity interests), (i) the Company or any Subsidiary has become
     obligated to purchase or repay Debt before its regular maturity or before

             (a) If an Event of Default with respect to the Company described in
        paragraph (g) or (h) of Section 11 (other than an Event of Default
        described in clause (1) of paragraph (g) or described in clause (6) of
        paragraph (g) by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses clause
        (1) of paragraph (g)) has occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall
        automatically become immediately due and payable.

             (b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
        the Required Holders may at any time at their option, by notice or
        notices to the Company, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be
        immediately due and payable.

             (c) If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of
        Section 11 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of
        Notes at the time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at
        any time, at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company,
        declare all the Notes held by it or them to be immediately due and
        payable.

             Upon any Note's becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1,
        whether automatically or by declaration, such Note will forthwith mature
        and the entire unpaid principal amount of such

                                        20
<PAGE>

        Note, plus (1) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (2) the
        Make-Whole Amount, if any, determined in respect of such principal
        amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be
        immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment,
        demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The
        Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of
        a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from
        repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided for),
        and that the provision for payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company
        in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result
        of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the
        deprivation of such right under such circumstances.

          Section 12.2. Other Remedies.  If any Default or Event of Default has
     occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have
     become or have been declared immediately due and payable under Section
     12.1, the holder of any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect
     and enforce the rights of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity
     or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of
     any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against
     a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the
     exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.

          Section 12.3. Rescission.  At any time after any Notes have been
     declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the
     Required Holders, by written notice to the Company, may rescind and annul
     any such declaration and its consequences if (a) the Company has paid all
     overdue interest on the Notes, all principal of and Make-Whole Amount, if
     any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid other than by
     reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal and
     Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by applicable law)
     any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the Default Rate, (b) all
     Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts that have
     become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or have
     been waived pursuant to Section 17 and (c) no judgment or decree has been
     entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes.
     No rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or
     affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right
     consequent thereon.

          Section 12.4. No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, Etc.  No
     course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in
     exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or
     otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right,
     power or remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder
     thereof shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to
     herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by
     statute or otherwise. Without limiting the obligations of the Company under
     Section 15, the Company will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such
     further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of
     such holder incurred in any enforcement or collection under this Section
     12, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and
     disbursements.

SECTION 13. REGISTRATION; EXCHANGE; SUBSTITUTION OF NOTES.

          Section 13.1. Registration of Notes.  The Company shall keep at its
     principal executive office a register for the registration and registration
     of transfers of Notes. The name and address of each holder of one or more
     Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and address of each transferee of
     one or more Notes shall be registered in such register. Prior to due
     presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note
     shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder
     thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by
     any notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to any
     holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request
     therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all
     registered holders of Notes.

          Section 13.2. Transfer and Exchange of Notes.  Upon surrender of any
     Note at the principal executive office of the Company for registration of
     transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for registration of
     transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
     duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or its attorney duly
     authorized in writing and accompanied by the

                                        21
<PAGE>

     address for notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), the
     Company shall execute and deliver, at the Company's expense (except as
     provided below), one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof)
     in exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid
     principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be
     payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be
     substantially in the form of Exhibit 1. Each such new Note shall be dated
     and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on
     the surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no
     interest shall have been paid thereon. The Company may require payment of a
     sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in
     respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in
     denominations of less than $100,000, provided that if necessary to enable
     the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes,
     one Note may be in a denomination of less than $100,000. Any transferee, by
     its acceptance of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its
     nominee), shall be deemed to have made the representation set forth in
     Section 6.2.

          Section 13.3. Replacement of Notes.  Upon receipt by the Company of
     evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and the loss,
     theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note (which evidence shall be, in
     the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from such Institutional
     Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or
     mutilation), and

             (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity
        reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note
        is, or is a nominee for, a Purchaser or another holder of a Note with a
        minimum net worth of at least $50,000,000, such Person's own unsecured
        agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or

             (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
        thereof,

        the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu
        thereof, a new Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to which
        interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or
        mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or
        mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.

SECTION 14. PAYMENTS ON NOTES.

          Section 14.1. Place of Payment.  Subject to Section 14.2, payments of
     principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest becoming due and payable
     on the Notes shall be made in New York, New York at the principal office of
     the Company in such jurisdiction. The Company may at any time, by notice to
     each holder of a Note, change the place of payment of the Notes so long as
     such place of payment shall be either the principal office of the Company
     in such jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust company in
     such jurisdiction.

          Section 14.2. Home Office Payment.  So long as any Purchaser or its
     nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything
     contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the Company will
     pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount, if
     any, and interest by the method and at the address specified for such
     purpose below such Purchaser's name in Schedule A, or by such other method
     or at such other address as such Purchaser shall have from time to time
     specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the
     presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation
     thereon, except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently
     with or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any
     Note, such Purchaser shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably
     promptly after any such request, to the Company at its principal executive
     office or at the place of payment most recently designated by the Company
     pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any
     Note held by any Purchaser or it's nominee such Purchaser will, at its
     election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and
     the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such
     Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section
     13.2. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any
     Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any
     Note purchased by any Purchaser under this Agreement and that has made the
     same agreement relating to such Note as such Purchaser has made in this
     Section 14.2.

     the Notes, those retained by such Purchaser or other holder).

          Section 15.2. Survival.  The obligations of the Company under this

     therein and the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any
     subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of any investigation made at any
     time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any other holder of a Note. All

          Section 17.1. Requirements.  This Agreement and the Notes may be
     amended, and the observance of any term hereof or of the Notes may be
     waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the
     written consent of the Company and the Required Holders, except that (a) no
     amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or
     21 hereof, or any defined term (as it is used therein), will be effective
     as to any holder unless consented to by such holder in writing, and (b) no
     such amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of the holder of
     each Note at the time outstanding affected thereby, (1) subject to the
     provisions of Section 12 relating to acceleration or rescission, change the
     amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the
     rate or change the time of payment or method of computation of interest or

          Section 17.2. Solicitation of Holders of Notes.

             (a) Solicitation.  The Company will provide each holder of the
        Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with
        sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a
        decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and
        considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or
        consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof or of the Notes. The
        Company will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each
        amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this
        Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes

                                        23
<PAGE>

        promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or
        receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.

             (b) Payment.  The Company will not directly or indirectly pay or
        cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or
        additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any
        holder of Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering
        into by any holder of Notes or any waiver or amendment of any of the
        terms and provisions hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently
        paid, or security is concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to
        each holder of Notes then outstanding even if such holder did not
        consent to such waiver or amendment.

          Section 17.3. Binding Effect, Etc.  Any amendment or waiver consented
     to as provided in this Section 17 applies equally to all holders of Notes
     and is binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon
     the Company without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate
     such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or
     affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not
     expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No
     course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor any
     delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as
     a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein, the term
     "this Agreement" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may
     from time to time be amended or supplemented.

          Section 17.4. Notes Held by Company, Etc.  Solely for the purpose of
     determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the
     aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented
     to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Agreement or the

     percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding,
     Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company or any of its Affiliates,
     including, without limitation, Fairfax Inc. and Zenith Insurance Company,
     shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges
prepaid), or (b) by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested

          (1) if to any Purchaser or its nominee, to such Purchaser or its

     to the Company in writing,

          (2) if to any other holder of any Note, to such holder at such address
     as such other holder shall have specified to the Company in writing, or

          (3) if to the Company, to the Company at its address set forth at the
     beginning hereof to the attention of Donald L. Smith, or at such other

information previously or hereafter furnished to any holder of the Notes, may be

microcard, miniature photographic or other similar process and such holders may
destroy any original document so reproduced. The Company agrees and stipulates
that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such reproduction shall be
admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative
proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such
reproduction

                                        24
<PAGE>

was made by any holder of the Notes in the regular course of business) and any
enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall
likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 19 shall not prohibit the
Company or any other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to
the same extent that it could contest the original, or from introducing evidence
to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

     For the purposes of this Section 20, "Confidential Information" means
information delivered to any Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly
marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by such
Purchaser as being confidential information of the Company or such Subsidiary,

or any Person acting on such Purchaser's behalf, (c) otherwise becomes known to
such Purchaser other than through disclosure by the Company or any Subsidiary or

adopted by such Purchaser in good faith to protect confidential information of
third parties delivered to such Purchaser, provided that such Purchaser may
deliver or disclose Confidential Information to (1) its directors, trustees,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such
disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of the investment
represented by such Purchaser's Notes), (2) such Purchaser's financial advisors
and other professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential
Information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 20, (3)
any other holder of any Note, (4) any Institutional Investor to which such
Purchaser sells or offers to sell such Note or any part thereof or any
participation therein (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt
of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section
20), (5) any Person from which such Purchaser offers to purchase any security of
the Company (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such
Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (6)
any Federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such
Purchaser, (7) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any
similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires
access to information about such Purchaser's investment portfolio or (8) any
other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or
appropriate (i) to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order
applicable to such Purchaser, (ii) in response to any subpoena or other legal
process, (iii) in connection with any litigation to which such Purchaser is a
party or (iv) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the
extent such Purchaser may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to
be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the
rights and remedies under such Purchaser's Notes and this Agreement. Each holder
of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be
bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were
a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Company in connection
with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be
delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other
than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder
will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying the provisions of this
Section 20.

SECTION 21. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER.

     Each Purchaser shall have the right to substitute any one of its Affiliates
as the purchaser of the Notes that such Purchaser has agreed to purchase
hereunder, by written notice to the Company, which notice shall be signed by
both such Purchaser and such Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate's agreement
to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate
of the accuracy with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section
6. Upon receipt of such notice, wherever the word "Purchaser" is used in this
Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall be deemed to refer to
such Affiliate in lieu of such Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate is so
substituted as a purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to
such Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the
Company of notice of such transfer, wherever the word "Purchaser" is used in
this Agreement (other than in
                                        25
<PAGE>

this Section 21), such word shall no longer be deemed to refer to such
Affiliate, but shall refer to such Purchaser, and such Purchaser shall have all
the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.

SECTION 22. MISCELLANEOUS.

          Section 22.1. Successors and Assigns.  All covenants and other
     agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the
     parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors
     and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent holder of a
     Note) whether so expressed or not.

          Section 22.2. Payments Due on Non-Business Days.  Anything in this
     Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, any payment of
     principal of or Make-Whole Amount, if any, or interest on any Note that is
     due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next
     succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in
     the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business
     Day.

          Section 22.3. Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement that is
     prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
     jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
     unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and
     any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the
     full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such
     provision in any other jurisdiction.

          Section 22.4. Construction.

             (a) Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent
        express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other
        covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant
        shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to
        excuse compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein
        refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is
        prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such
        action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.

             (b) Where the character or amount of any asset or liability or item
        of income or expense is required to be determined or any consolidation
        or other accounting computation is required to be made by the Company
        for the purposes of this Agreement, the same shall be done by the
        Company in accordance with GAAP, to the extent applicable, except where
        such principles are inconsistent with the requirements of this
        Agreement.

          Section 22.5. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any
     number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which
     together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a
     number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed
     by all, of the parties hereto.

          Section 22.6. Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed and
     enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be
     governed by, the law of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law
     principles of the law of such State that would require the application of
     the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State.

                                   * * * * *

     The execution hereof by the Purchasers shall constitute a contract among
the Company and the Purchasers for the uses and purposes hereinabove set forth.

(416) 360-8484

                                December 4, 2001

To: The Purchasers listed on
    Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreement
    (as defined below)

                           ODYSSEY RE HOLDINGS CORP.
                          7.49% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2006

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     We are acting as counsel to Odyssey Re Holdings Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in the note purchase agreement dated as of
November 15, 2001 (the "Note Purchase Agreement") among the Company and each of
the purchasers listed on Schedule A thereto (the "Purchasers"), by the
Purchasers of U.S.$100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.49%
Senior Notes due November 30, 2006 (the "Notes"). This opinion is being
delivered to you in accordance with Section 4.4(a) of the Note Purchase
Agreement. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement.

     In such capacity, we have examined (a) a signed copy of the Note Purchase
Agreement; (b) copies of the signed Notes; and (c) a copy of the Private
Placement Memorandum dated October 2001.

     We have also examined the originals, or copies identified to our
satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, certificates of public
officials, officers of the Company and other persons and such other documents,
agreements and instruments, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the
opinions hereinafter expressed. In our examinations, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us
as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to
us as copies.

                                 Exhibit 4.4(a)
                          (to Note Purchase Agreement)
<PAGE>

     Our opinions expressed below are limited to the laws of the State of New
York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws
of the United States, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any
other law.

     Based upon the foregoing, and having regard for such legal considerations
as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:

          (i) The Note Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
     delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
     the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

          (ii) The Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
     the Company and constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company,
     enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.

          (iii) Based upon our review of New York State and United States
     federal statutes, rules and regulations which in our experience are
     normally applicable to transactions of the type provided for in the Note
     Purchase Agreement (the "Requirements of Law"), but without having made any
     special investigation concerning any other requirements of law, no consent,
     approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with
     any United States federal or New York State court or governmental agency or
     body is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the
     Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under,
     the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes.

          (iv) Assuming the accuracy of the representations of the Company and
     of the Purchasers in the Note Purchase Agreement and of Banc of America
     Securities LLC in its agent's certificate dated the date hereof, no
     registration of the offer and sale of Notes to the Purchasers under the
     Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and no qualification of a trust
     indenture in respect of the Notes under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
     amended, is required in connection with the offer, sale and delivery of the
     Notes under the circumstances contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement.

          (v) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance
     by the Company of its obligations under, the Note Purchase Agreement and
     the Notes will not contravene or violate any order, judgment or decree of
     any United States federal or New York State court or governmental agency or
     body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
     violate the provisions of any United States federal or New York State
     statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries. This opinion is based on our review of the Requirements of
     Law and those orders, judgments and decrees specifically identified to us
     by the Company as being those to which it or its Subsidiaries are subject,
     but without our having made any special investigation concerning any other
     requirements of law.

          (vi) The issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds thereof as
     contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement will not result in any
     violation of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
     Reserve System (12 C.F.R., Chapter II, as amended).

          (vii) The Company is not required to be registered as an "investment
     company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     The opinions set forth in sub paragraphs (i) and (ii) above are subject to
the qualification that enforcement is (x) subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws
relating to preferences or fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to
possible judicial action giving effect to governmental actions or foreign laws
affecting creditors' rights and (y) subject to the effect of general principles
of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality,
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     These opinions are intended solely for your benefit and are not to be made
available to, or relied upon by, any other person or entity (other than
permitted transferees of the Notes) without our prior written consent, provided
that you may make this opinion available to (i) your independent auditors and
attorneys, (ii) any
                                    E-4.4(a)-2
<PAGE>

state or federal authority or independent insurance board or body having
regulatory jurisdiction over you, (iii) any person pursuant to order or legal
process of any court or governmental agency, (iv) any person in connection with
any legal action to which you are a party arising out of or in respect of the
Note Purchase Agreement or the Notes, and (v) any proposed purchasers or
subsequent holders of the Notes.

                                          Very truly yours,

                                    E-4.4(a)-3

                                 TO THE COMPANY

To: The Purchasers listed on
    Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreement
    (as defined below)

                           ODYSSEY RE HOLDINGS CORP.
                          7.49% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2006

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     I, Donald L. Smith, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate
Secretary for Odyssey Re Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
licensed to practice law in the State of New York, have agreed to provide an
in-house legal opinion in connection with the purchase, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the note purchase agreement dated as of November 15,
2001 (the "Note Purchase Agreement") between the Company and each of the
purchasers listed on Schedule A thereto (the "Purchasers"), by the Purchasers of
U.S.$100,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 7.49% Senior Notes due
November 30, 2006 (the "Notes"). This opinion is being delivered to you in
accordance with Section 4.4(b) of the Note Purchase Agreement. All capitalized
terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms
in the Note Purchase Agreement.

     In such capacity I have examined (a) a signed copy of the Note Purchase
Agreement; (b) copies of the signed Notes; and (c) a copy of the Private
Placement Memorandum dated October 2001.

     I have also examined the originals, or copies identified to my
satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company and its subsidiaries,
certificates of public officials, officers of the Company and other persons, and
such other documents, agreements and instruments, as I have deemed necessary as
a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In my examination, I have
assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the originals of all
documents submitted to me as copies.

     The opinions set forth below are limited to the laws of the State of New
York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws
of the United States, and I do not express any opinion herein concerning any
other laws.

Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that

                                 Exhibit 4.4(b)
                          (to Note Purchase Agreement)
<PAGE>

          (i) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and validly
     existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
     the corporate power and authority under such laws to enter into and perform
     its obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes and has the
     corporate power and authority to conduct the activities in which it is now
     engaged and is duly licensed or qualified and is in good standing as a
     foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
     properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business transacted
     by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary other than those
     jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in
     good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (ii) Each Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal entity duly
     organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
     jurisdiction of organization and is duly licensed or qualified and is in
     good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each
     jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it
     or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such licensing or
     qualification necessary other than those jurisdictions as to which the
     failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing could not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect and all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
     stock or other equity interests of each such Subsidiary have been duly
     issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by the Company, by
     one or more Subsidiaries, or by the Company and one or more Subsidiaries.

          (iii) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the
     performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Note Purchase
     Agreement and issuance and sale of the Notes will not conflict with or
     result in any breach of any of the provisions of or constitute a default
     under or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the
     property of the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Amended and
     Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any
     agreement or other instrument known to me to which the Company is a party
     or by which the Company may be bound.

     This opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof. I do not assume, and
I expressly disclaim, any responsibility to advise any of you of any change of
law or fact that may occur after the date of this opinion letter even though
such change may affect the legal analysis, a legal conclusion or any other
matter set forth in or relating to the opinion letter.

     These opinions are intended solely for your benefit and are not to be made
available to, or relied upon by, any other person or entity (other than
permitted transferees of the Notes) without my prior written consent, provided
that you may make this opinion available to (i) your independent auditors and
attorneys, (ii) any state or federal authority or independent insurance board or
body having regulatory jurisdiction over you, (iii) any person pursuant to order
or legal process of any court or governmental agency, (iv) any person in
connection with any legal action to which you are a party arising out of or in
respect of the Note Purchase Agreement or the Notes, and (v) any proposed
purchasers or subsequent holders of the Notes.

                                          Very truly yours,

                       FORM OF OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL
                          TO THE TRAVELERS PURCHASERS

     The closing opinion of Chapman and Cutler, special counsel to the Travelers
Purchasers, called for by Section 4.4(c) of the Note Purchase Agreement, shall
be dated the date of the Closing and addressed to Zenith Insurance Company and
each Travelers Purchaser, shall be satisfactory in form and substance to each
Travelers Purchaser and shall be to the effect that:

          1. The Company is a corporation, validly existing and in good standing
     under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power and the
     corporate authority to execute and deliver the Note Purchase Agreement and
     to issue the Notes.

          2. The Note Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized by all
     necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, has been duly
     executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and
     binding contract of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms,
     subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws
     affecting creditors' rights generally, and general principles of equity
     (regardless of whether the application of such principles is considered in
     a proceeding in equity or at law).

          3. The Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
     action on the part of the Company, and the Notes being delivered on the
     date hereof have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
     constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company
     enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy,
     insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting creditors'
     rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of whether
     the application of such principles is considered in a proceeding in equity
     or at law).

          4. The issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes under the
     circumstances contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement do not, under
     existing law, require the registration of the Notes under the Securities
     Act or the qualification of an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of
     1939, as amended.

     The opinion of Chapman and Cutler shall also state that the opinions of
Shearman and Sterling and Donald L. Smith, Esq. are satisfactory in scope and
form to Chapman and Cutler and that, in their opinion, Zenith Insurance Company
and each Travelers Purchaser is justified in relying thereon.

     In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph 1 above, Chapman and Cutler
may rely, as to matters referred to in paragraph 1, solely upon an examination
of the Certificate of Incorporation certified by, and a certificate of good
standing of the Company from, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
the By-laws of the Company and the general business corporation law of the State
of Delaware. The opinion of Chapman and Cutler is limited to the laws of the
State of New York, the general business corporation law of the State of Delaware
and the Federal laws of the United States.

     With respect to matters of fact upon which such opinion is based, Chapman
and Cutler may rely on appropriate certificates of public officials and officers
of the Company and upon representations of the Company and the Purchasers
delivered in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes.
