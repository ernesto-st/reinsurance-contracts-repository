in an adverse consequence on the Borrower (including any diminution of rights of Borrower against ADF or Lender under the Letter of Intent), resulting from, among other things, that such assignment or participation (i)&nbsp;requires the consent of
any member in the SLS Lender, LLC or is not expressly permitted by the Operating Agreement, or (ii)&nbsp;requires consent under or violates the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program or result in any adverse effect on Borrower. Any transfer of any interest
held by ADF in Lender or SLS Lender Manager, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, shall be deemed an assignment of the Loan that is subject to this Section&nbsp;10.04(a)(i). Lender acknowledges that ADF and Lender have affirmative obligations
in favor of the Borrower and other First Lien Loan Parties pursuant to the Letter of Intent. Lender shall not take (or permit any affiliates to take) any action that could reasonably be expected to result in any diminution of obligations on the part
of ADF under the Letter of Intent or result in a violation of the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ADF may transfer its interests in the Lender, to either (x)&nbsp;a regional center duly approved by United States
Citizenship and Immigration Services or (y)&nbsp;a party which becomes a successor in interest to ADF pursuant to a merger or consolidation, provided, in each case, the assignee or successor agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the Letter of Intent and provided further, in each case, the assignee or successor is reasonably acceptable to the Borrower with respect to the assignee&#146;s or successor&#146;s ability to perform those duties, acts or obligations
