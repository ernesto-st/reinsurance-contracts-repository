The Company shall notify the Reinsurer of any  material changes that it makes to its claims handling practices after the date hereof with  respect to the Subject Business, which notice shall include an explanation of the rationale  for such changes.  If the Company changes its claims practices or, without a formal change,  engages in a pattern of claims practices having, in the aggregate, the effect of such a  change, in a manner that the Reinsurer reasonably believes has a material adverse effect on  the Reinsurer&#8217;s liability or the attachment of the Reinsurer&#8217;s liability, the Reinsurer shall  notify the Company promptly after becoming aware of such effect (an &#8220;Adverse  Modification Notice&#8221;) and the Parties shall work together in good faith to seek to modify  such change to the practices in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided,  however, that if the Parties, acting in good faith, are unable to agree with respect to whether  there has been a material change in the claims practices or whether and how a corrective  modification shall be implemented or the impact of such changes, the Reinsurer shall have  the right, within 90 days following the submission of the Adverse Modification Notice, to  submit the dispute as to whether there was a material change to the claims handling  practices and, if so, whether the change did cause a material adverse effect on the  Reinsurer&#8217;s liability hereunder or the attachment thereof (a &#8220;Claims Practice Modification  Dispute&#8221;) to a panel comprising a neutral Senior Insurance Professional and the Third Party  Actuarial Firm (the &#8220;Panel&#8221;) to resolve such Claims Practice Modification Dispute.

The Panel shall issue its written determination with respect to Claims Practice  Modification Dispute within 30 days after such matters are submitted to the Panel;  provided, however, that the failure of the Panel to make its written determination in such  thirty (30) day period shall not be grounds to defend against, object to the enforcement of  or contest the validity or enforceability of such written determination.

The costs and expenses  of the Panel shall be split evenly between the Company and the Reinsurer. The  determinations by the Panel shall be binding on the Parties with respect to the Claims  Practice Modification Dispute.

B. During the duration of this Agreement:  1. from the Closing Date until the date on which an Administrative Rights Triggering  Event (if any) occurs, the Reinsurer and each of its designated Affiliates shall have  the administrative rights set forth on Schedule D attached hereto (the &#8220;Initial  Administrative Rights&#8221;); and  2. from the date on which an Administrative Rights Triggering Event occurs until such  time as the Ultimate Net Loss exceeds the Aggregate Limit, the Reinsurer and each  of its designated Affiliates shall have the right to administer all of the Subject  Business reinsured hereunder at its cost pursuant to the Administrative Services  Agreement, including the right to retain third-party administration.  C. The Company shall retain control over the administration of any Third-party Reinsurance;  provided that following an Administrative Rights Triggering Event, the Reinsurer or its  designated Affiliate shall have the right to either supervise the administration of the Third- party Reinsurance by the Company or assume management of the Third-party Reinsurance.   D. Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Party  as reasonably requested by such other Party in connection with the administration of the  Subject Business as contemplated by this Article, and take such further actions and execute  such further documents and agreements as may be necessary to carry out the purpose and  intent of this Article. If the Reinsurer elects to assume the administration of the Subject  Business following the occurrence of an Administrative Rights Triggering Event, the  Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide reasonable transition and  migration services, which, (i) in the case of transition services (e.g., services that would  require the Company to host the Reinsurer or any of its Affiliates on any system of the  Company or its Affiliates or require the services of one or more full time employees) shall  be provided pursuant to a negotiated transition services agreement that shall be in a  customary form (including with respect to compensation to the Company and its Affiliates  for providing such services) and (ii) in the case of data migration services, the Company  shall bear the cost of delivering the data in a reasonable format agreed upon by the Parties.  </FONT></DIV>

The delivery of written notice by either Party to the other Party, in the event that  the Closing Date has not occurred within 180 days following the date hereof, unless  the failure of the Closing Date to occur by such date arises out of, or results from,  the failure of such Party seeking to terminate this Agreement (or any of its  Affiliates) to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.  5. The delivery of written notice by either Party to the other Party, in the event that  any of the Required Regulatory Approvals shall have been affirmatively denied or  disapproved pursuant to a final and non-appealable Order.

Errors and Omissions  Any inadvertent delay, omission, or error will not relieve the non-erring Party hereto from  any liability, which would attach to it hereunder if such delay, omission or error had not  been made, provided, such omission or error is rectified promptly upon discovery.  G. Further Assurances  Each of the Parties shall at any time (and from time to time on being reasonably required  by the other Party) execute or procure all acts, deeds, documents and things reasonably  necessary and within its power to give effect to the terms of this Agreement.

H. Severability  1. If any provision of this Agreement shall be rendered illegal or unenforceable by the  laws, regulations or public policy of any jurisdiction, such provision shall be  considered void in such jurisdiction, but this shall not affect the validity or  enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement or the validity or  enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.  2.

I. No Waiver  The failure to exercise or delay in exercising a right or remedy provided by this Agreement  or by Applicable Law does not impair or constitute a waiver of the right or remedy or an  impairment of or a waiver of other rights or remedies.  No single or partial exercise of a  right or remedy provided by this Agreement or by Applicable Law presents further exercise  of the right or remedy, or the exercise, of another right or remedy.  J. Parties to this Agreement   The Parties shall not assign, novate, transfer, declare a trust or in any other way alienate  any other rights under this Agreement, whether in whole or in part, without the prior written  consent of the other Party.  This Agreement shall be binding upon all successors, assignees  and transferees of the Parties to this Agreement; provided, however, that neither this  Agreement nor any rights or obligations under this Agreement may be novated, assigned,  charged or otherwise transferred or disposed of by either Party without the prior written  consent of the other Party.

K. Rights and Remedies  No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right or remedy provided by law or under  this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement shall impair such right or remedy or operate  or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or preclude its exercise at any subsequent time  and no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall preclude any further  exercise of it or the exercise of any other remedy.  L. Third Party Rights  Nothing will in any manner create any obligations or establish any rights against the  Reinsurer in favor of any third parties or any persons not parties to this Agreement except  as expressly provided otherwise herein.

The Company shall pay to the applicable Governmental  Authority, any and all Federal Excise Tax due with respect to the premium payable  to the Reinsurer hereunder, to the extent such premium is subject to the Federal  Excise Tax.  2.

One arbitrator shall be chosen by each Party and the two arbitrators shall then choose an  impartial third arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing.  If either Party fails to appoint its  arbitrator within 30 days after being requested to do so by the other Party, the latter, after  ten days&#8217; prior notice by certified or registered mail of its intention to do so, may appoint  the second arbitrator.  C. If the two arbitrators do not agree on a third arbitrator within 60 days of their appointment,  the third arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the following procedures: Each Party  shall each exchange within ten calendar days thereafter, five names of individuals who are  qualified to serve hereunder. Within seven calendar days of the exchange of names, the  petitioner and respondent will agree on an umpire questionnaire to be sent to the umpire  candidates by the party arbitrators. Umpire candidates must return a fully completed  questionnaire to both Parties within 14 calendar days from when the questionnaire was  sent.  If any individual fails to return a questionnaire within the required time period or  refuses to serve, the Party whose candidate did not respond or cannot serve, shall within  five calendar days from the expiration of the period for return of the questionnaire, or notice  of the refusal to serve, replenish its candidate pool to five individuals who could be  qualified to serve hereunder and who shall answer the umpire questionnaire sent with the  request to serve, within 14 calendar days from it being sent.  After completion of this  process, if there is one common individual chosen by the Parties, that individual shall serve  as umpire. If there is more than one common individual chosen by the Parties, the Parties,  unless they then agree to one individual, shall draw lots from among those chosen, and the  individual chosen by lot shall act as umpire. If there are no common individuals chosen by  Parties, each shall rank each of ten selected names in order of preference, with the number  &#8220;one&#8221; being the most preferred and shall simultaneously notify the other Party of such  ranking on a mutually agreed date.  The individual with the lowest total numerical ranking  shall act as umpire.  If the ranking results in a tie, the Parties shall draw lots from among  the individuals tied for the lowest total numerical rank, and the individual chosen by lot  shall act as umpire.  The arbitrators shall be persons knowledgeable about insurance and  reinsurance who have no personal or financial interest in the result of the arbitration.  If a  member of the panel dies, becomes disabled or is otherwise unwilling or unable to serve, a  substitute shall be selected in the same manner as the departing member was chosen and  the arbitration shall continue.  D. Within 30 days after all arbitrators have been appointed, the panel shall meet and determine  timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures, and schedules of hearings.  E. The panel shall be relieved of all judicial formality and shall not be bound by the strict  rules of procedure and evidence.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, the arbitrators may at their discretion consider underwriting and placement  information provided by the Company to the Reinsurer, as well as any correspondence  exchanged by the parties that is related to this Agreement.  The arbitration shall take place  in Chicago, Illinois or at such other place as the Parties shall agree.  The decision of any  two arbitrators shall be in writing and shall be final and binding.  The panel is empowered  to grant relief as it may deem appropriate; however, in no event will the panel be authorized  to award punitive damages.   </FONT></DIV>

The panel shall interpret this Agreement as an honorable engagement rather than as merely  a legal obligation and shall make its decision considering the custom and practice of the  applicable insurance and reinsurance business as promptly as possible after the hearings.  Judgment upon an award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  G. Each Party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly bear with the Other  party the cost of the third arbitrator.  The remaining costs of the arbitration shall be  allocated by the panel.  The panel may, at its discretion, award such further costs and  expenses as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to attorney&#8217;s fees, to the  extent permitted by law.  H. This Article shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.  ARTICLE 19 - EXPEDITED DISPUTE RESOLUTION  Prior to the commencement of arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Article, the Parties  will utilize an expedited dispute resolution process involving one senior executive from each of  the Company and the Reinsurer (each, a &#8220;Senior Executive&#8221;).  If such Senior Executives are unable  to resolve the dispute within ten Business Days of the dispute being referred to them, either Party  may seek to resolve the dispute in accordance with the Arbitration Article.  ARTICLE 20 - GOVERNING LAW  This Agreement, and any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement,  will be governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of Illinois.    ARTICLE 21 - INTERMEDIARY  A. [***] is hereby recognized as the Intermediary (the &#8220;Intermediary&#8221;).  B. The Company shall pay the Intermediary brokerage equal to [***] within three Business  Days after receipt of the Initial Reinsurance Premium.  ARTICLE 22 - WAIVER OF DUTY OF UTMOST GOOD FAITH   With respect to the reinsurance relationships and transactions among the parties and their Affiliates  contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, each party absolutely and  irrevocably waives resort to the duty of &#8220;utmost good faith&#8221; or any similar principle in connection  with the negotiation or execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements;  provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed or interpreted to limit in any manner the express  representations and warranties made by the Parties in this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, each party agrees  that it does not waive any such duty of &#8220;utmost good faith&#8221; or any similar principle relating to the  conduct of the parties under this Agreement after the Closing.       </FONT></DIV>
