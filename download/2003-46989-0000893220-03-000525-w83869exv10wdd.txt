         CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of December 20, 2002 (as amended, restated,

                                    RECITALS

         A.       The Company has requested that the Lenders (i) provide credit
                  facilities of up to $325,000,000 on the Closing Date and (ii)
                  provide the Company with the ability to propose to incur up to
                  an additional $150,000,000 in the form of an incremental term
                  loan, in each case, for the purposes hereinafter set forth;
                  and

         B.       The Lenders have agreed to make the requested credit
                  facilities to the Company on the terms and conditions
                  hereinafter set forth.

         Therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

         SECTION 1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.

         In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (as that
term and other capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are hereinafter
defined in Section 7) to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and
other extensions of credit hereunder, the Credit Parties make the following
representations, covenants and warranties which shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Credit Documents:

                           1.1.     CORPORATE OR OTHER AUTHORITY.

         (a)      Each Credit Party is duly incorporated, organized or formed,
validly existing and is in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation, organization or formation. The execution, delivery and
performance of the Credit Documents are within each Credit Party's corporate or
other organizational authority and have been duly authorized by proper corporate
or other proceedings. This Agreement has been, and each of the other Credit
Documents required to be executed and delivered by a Credit Party will be, duly
executed and delivered by each Credit Party that is a party thereto.
<PAGE>
         (b)      Each Credit Party (i) has the corporate or other necessary
power and authority, and the legal right, to (A) own and operate its property,
to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which
it is currently engaged and (B) execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under the Credit Documents and (ii) is duly qualified as a foreign entity and in
good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or
operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                           1.2.     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

         (a)      The consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flow (including the notes
thereto) for the fiscal year ended on such date, reported upon by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries
as of said date and the consolidated results of their operations for such fiscal
year, in conformity with GAAP.

         (b)      The consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of income and cash flows for the quarterly period ended on such date,
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of said date and the
consolidated results of their operations for such quarterly period, in
conformity with GAAP; provided, however, that such financial statements are
subject to year-end adjustments.

         (c)      The financial statements delivered to the Lenders pursuant to
Section 5.1(a)(i) and (ii), (i) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except as may otherwise be permitted hereunder) and (ii) present fairly (on the
basis disclosed in the footnotes to such financial statements) the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and for such periods.

                           1.3.     VALIDITY OF DOCUMENTS.

         (a)      This Agreement constitutes, and the other Credit Documents
when duly executed and delivered by each Credit Party that is a party thereto in
accordance with this Agreement will constitute, legal, valid and binding
obligations of each Credit Party, each enforceable in accordance with its terms
except as the enforceability of such Credit Document may be limited (x) by
general principles of equity and conflicts of laws or (y) by bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws of general application
relating to or affecting the enforcement, of creditors' rights. Neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the other Credit
Documents, nor compliance with the terms and provisions hereof and thereof, will

by which it or its properties is bound, or constitute a default thereunder,
except where such conflict, breach or default would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect or (iv) result in or require the creation of
any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon a Credit Party or with respect to its
properties.

         (b)      No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or
other similar act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other
Person is required to be obtained or made by or on behalf of any Credit Party in
connection with the borrowings or other extensions of credit hereunder or with

with respect to any indenture, loan agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, contract
or other agreement or instrument to which a Credit Party is a party, or by which
it or its properties is bound that could, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Credit Document.

                           1.5.     LITIGATION.

         Except as set forth on the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for

Senior Notes due 2003 at maturity), (ii) to fund cash taxes and restructuring
costs, (iii) to pay related fees and expenses in connection with the Credit

                           1.7.     NO CHANGE.

         Since December 31, 2001, there has been no development or event which
has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, other
than facts, circumstances, changes or events, which, as of September 30, 2002,
have been discussed in the Company's public filings with the SEC, but only to
the extent actually discussed in such filings (i.e. without giving effect to any
material deterioration since the date of such filings).

                           1.8.     FEDERAL REGULATIONS.

         No part of the Letters of Credit or the proceeds of any Loans will be
used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock", within the respective
meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter
in effect or for any purpose which violates the provisions of the Regulations of
such Board of Governors. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative Agent,
the Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement
to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1
referred to in said Regulation U.

                           1.9.     ERISA.

         (a)      Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Federal or state Laws. Each
Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter
is currently being processed by the IRS with respect thereto and, to the best
knowledge of the Credit Parties, nothing has occurred which would prevent, or
cause the loss of, such qualification. Each Credit Party and each ERISA
Affiliate have made all required contributions to each Plan subject to Section
412 of the Code, and no application for a funding waiver or an extension of any
amortization period pursuant to Section 412 of the Code has been made with
respect to any Plan.

         (b)      There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Credit
Parties, threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any Governmental
Authority, with respect to any Plan that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. There has been no prohibited transaction or violation
of the fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to any Plan that has resulted
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         (c)      (i) None of the following has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur: (a) a Reportable Event with respect to a Pension Plan; (b) a
withdrawal by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate from a Pension Plan subject to
Section 4063 of ERISA during a plan year in which it was a substantial employer
(as defined in Section 4001(a)(2) of ERISA) or a cessation of operations that is
treated as such a withdrawal under Section 4062(e) of ERISA; (c) a complete or
partial withdrawal by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate from a Multiemployer

                                       4
<PAGE>
Plan or notification that a Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization; (d) the
filing of a notice of intent to terminate, the treatment of a Plan amendment as
a termination under Sections 4041 or 4041A of ERISA, or the commencement of
proceedings by the PBGC to terminate a Pension Plan or Multiemployer Plan; (e)
an event or condition which constitutes grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for
the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any Pension
Plan or Multiemployer Plan; or (f) the imposition of any liability under Title
IV of ERISA, other than for PBGC premiums due but not delinquent under Section
4007 of ERISA, upon the Company or any ERISA Affiliate; (ii) no Pension Plan has
any Unfunded Pension Liability that is not being funded in accordance with
ERISA; (iii) no Credit Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably
expects to incur, any liability (and no event has occurred which, with the
giving of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such liability)
under Sections 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer Plan; and
(iv) no Credit Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction that
could be subject to Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA; except to the extent
that, in each case in clauses (i) through (iv) above, any such event or
condition, together with all other such events or conditions, if any, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                           1.10.    INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; OTHER REGULATIONS.

         No Credit Party is an "investment company", or a company "controlled"
by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. No Credit Party is subject to regulation under any Federal or
State statute or regulation which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness. No
director, executive officer or principal shareholder of a Credit Party or any of
its Subsidiaries is a director, executive officer or principal shareholder of
any Lender. For the purposes hereof the terms "director", "executive officer"
and "principal shareholder" (when used with reference to any Lender) have the
respective meanings assigned thereto in Regulation O issued by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System. None of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the direct or indirect use of
the proceeds of the Loans) will violate or result in a violation of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, or regulations issued pursuant thereto.

                           1.11.    COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

         Each of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries is in compliance
with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply
therewith could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                           1.12.    TAXES.

         Each of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries has filed, or
caused to be filed, all tax returns (federal, state, provincial, local and
foreign) required to be filed and paid (a) all amounts of taxes shown thereon to
be due (including interest and penalties) and (b) all other taxes, fees,
assessments and other governmental charges (including mortgage recording taxes,
documentary stamp taxes and intangibles taxes) owing by it, except for such
taxes (i) which are not yet delinquent or (ii) that are being contested in good
faith and by proper proceedings, and against which adequate

                                       5
<PAGE>
reserves are being maintained in accordance with GAAP (if such reserves are
required pursuant to GAAP). No Credit Party is aware as of the Closing Date of
any proposed tax assessments against any of the Company and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect and against which adequate reserves are not being maintained in
accordance with GAAP (if such reserves are required pursuant to GAAP).

                           1.13.    SUBSIDIARIES.

Capital Stock outstanding, the number and percentage of outstanding shares of
each class owned (directly or indirectly) by a Credit Party; and the number and
effect, if exercised, of all outstanding options, warrants, rights of conversion
or purchase and all other similar rights with respect thereto. The outstanding
Capital Stock of all such Subsidiaries is validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and is owned by each such Credit Party, directly or indirectly,
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens). Other than as set
forth in Schedule 1.13, no such Subsidiary has outstanding any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for its Capital Stock nor does any such Person
have outstanding any rights to subscribe for or to purchase or any options for
the purchase of, or any agreements providing for the issuance (contingent or
otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to
its Capital Stock. Schedule 1.13 may be updated from time to time by the Company
by giving written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent.

                           1.14.    ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

         (a)      Except as set forth in the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the
SEC for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2002, as would not have or be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or to the extent related
solely to asbestos personal injury claims (it being understood that such claims
are covered separately under Section 1.5):

                  (i)      Each of the real properties owned by the Credit

         Subsidiaries (the "Businesses"), and there are no conditions relating
         to the Businesses or Real Properties that would be reasonably expected
         to give rise to liability under any applicable Environmental Laws.

                  (ii)     No Credit Party has received any written notice of,
         or inquiry from any Governmental Authority regarding, any violation,
         alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or potential liability
         regarding Hazardous Materials or compliance with Environmental Laws
         with regard to any of the Real Properties or the Businesses, nor does
         any Credit Party have knowledge or reason to believe that any such
         notice is being threatened.

         disposed of from the Real Properties, or generated, treated, stored or
         disposed of at, on or under any of the Real Properties or any other
         location, in each case by, or on behalf or with the permission of, the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (iv)     No judicial proceeding or governmental or
         administrative action is pending or, to the knowledge of any Credit
         Party, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which any Credit
         Party is or, to the best knowledge of such Credit Party, will be named
         as a party, nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent
         orders, administrative orders or other orders, or other administrative
         or judicial requirements outstanding under any Environmental Law with
         respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Real Properties
         or the Businesses.

                  (v)      There has been no release or, to the best knowledge
         of any Credit Party, threat of release of Hazardous Materials at or
         from the Real Properties, or arising from or related to the operations
         (including, without limitation, disposal) of the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries in connection with the Real Properties or otherwise in
         connection with the Businesses, in violation of, or in amounts or in a
         manner that could give rise to liability under, Environmental Laws.

                  (vi)     None of the Real Properties contains, or has
         previously contained, any Hazardous Materials at, on or under the Real
         Properties in amounts or concentrations that, if released, constitute
         or constituted a violation of, or would give rise to liability under,
         Environmental Laws.

                  (vii)    No Credit Party, nor any of its Subsidiaries, has
         assumed any liability of any Person (other than another Credit Party,
         or one of its Subsidiaries) under any Environmental Law.

         (b)      The Company has adopted procedures that are designed to (i)
ensure that each Credit Party, each of its operations and each of the properties
owned or leased by each Credit Party remains in compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws, to the extent that the failure to comply with such
Environmental Laws would have or would be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and (ii) manage, to the same extent as and in accordance with
the practices of companies engaged in the same or a similar business, any
liabilities or potential liabilities that each Credit Party, any of its
operations and each of the properties owned or leased by each Credit Party may
have under applicable Environmental Laws.

<PAGE>
         (a)      Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth,
to make revolving credit loans in Dollars ("Revolving Loans") to the Company,
from time to time during the Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount
at any one time outstanding not to exceed the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata
Share of ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($125,000,000) (as such amount
may be reduced pursuant to this Agreement, the "Revolving Committed Amount");
provided that with regard to each individual Lender, the principal amount of
such Lender's Pro Rata Share of outstanding Revolving Loans plus such Lender's
Pro Rata Share of outstanding Swingline Loans plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share
of LOC Obligations outstanding shall not exceed such Lender's Revolving
Commitment. During the Commitment Period the Company may use the Revolving
Committed Amount by borrowing, prepaying the Revolving Loans in whole or in
part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof;
provided that in no event shall the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Revolving Loans plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline
Loans plus all LOC Obligations outstanding at any one time outstanding exceed
the Revolving Committed Amount. There shall be no Revolving Loans outstanding on
the Closing Date.

         (b)      Loan Types. The Revolving Loans may from time to time be (i)
Eurodollar Loans, (ii) ABR Loans or (iii) a combination thereof, as determined
by the Company and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with
Sections 2.3 and 2.7, provided that no Revolving Loan shall be made as a
Eurodollar Loan after the day that is one month prior to the Revolving Credit
Termination Date.

                           2.2.     NOTES EVIDENCING REVOLVING LOANS.

         The Revolving Loans made by each Lender shall, at the request of such
Lender, be evidenced by a promissory note of the Company, substantially in the
form of Exhibit A (as amended, modified, restated, supplemented, extended,
renewed or replaced from time to time, a "Note"), with appropriate insertions as
to payee, payable to the order of such Lender. Each Lender is hereby authorized
to record the date, Type and amount of each Revolving Loan made by such Lender,
each continuation thereof, each conversion of all or a portion thereof to
another Type, the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal
thereof and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the length of each Interest Period
with respect thereto, on a schedule annexed to and constituting a part of its
Note and any such recordation shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
accuracy of the information so recorded; provided, however, that the failure to
make any such recordation or an error in any such recordation shall not affect
the liability of the Company hereunder or under any Note. Each Note shall (a) be
dated the Closing Date and (b) provide for the payment of principal and interest
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                           2.3.     PROCEDURE FOR REVOLVING CREDIT BORROWING.

Commitment Period on any Business Day (except for the Closing Date), provided
that the Company shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which
notice must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 A.M. (New
York, New York time) (a) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested
Borrowing Date, if all or any part of the requested

                                       10
<PAGE>
Revolving Loan is to be initially Eurodollar Loans or (b) one (1) Business Day
prior to the requested Borrowing Date, otherwise), substantially in the form of
Exhibit D, specifying (i) the amount to be borrowed, (ii) the requested
Borrowing Date, (iii) whether the borrowing is to be of Eurodollar Loans, ABR
Loans or a combination thereof, and the respective amounts of each such Type of
Loan, (iv) if the borrowing is to be entirely or partly of Eurodollar Loans, the
respective lengths of the initial Interest Periods therefor, and (v) remittance
instructions. Each borrowing under the Revolving Committed Amount shall be in an
amount equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof
(or, with respect to ABR Loans only, if the then available amount under the
applicable Revolving Committed Amount is less than $5,000,000, such lesser
amount). Upon receipt of any such notice from the Company, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Each Lender will make the
amount of its Pro Rata Share of each borrowing available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Company at the office of the Administrative Agent
specified in Section 9.2 prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York, New York time) on the
Borrowing Date in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Such
borrowing will then be made available to the Company by the Administrative Agent
crediting the account of the Company as set forth on the notice of borrowing
with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by
the Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

                           2.4.     FEES.

         (a)      Commitment Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a fee (the "Commitment Fee")
for the period from and including the first day of the Commitment Period to the
Revolving Credit Termination Date, computed at the Applicable Margin for
Commitment Fee on the actual daily amount by which the Revolving Committed
Amount exceeds the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans
(and funded Participation Interests in Swingline Loans) and (ii) the LOC
Obligations outstanding. The Commitment Fee shall be due and payable quarterly
in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December
and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date or such earlier date as the
Revolving Committed Amount shall terminate as provided herein, commencing on the
first of such dates to occur after the Closing Date. For purposes of
clarification, in computing the Commitment Fee hereunder (A) LOC Obligations
shall be considered usage under the aggregate Revolving Committed Amount and (B)
Swingline Loans shall not be considered usage under the aggregate Revolving
Committed Amount unless and until other Lenders having a Revolving Commitment
purchase Participation Interests in such Swingline Loans pursuant to Section
2.13(b)(iii).

         (b)      Other Fees.

                  (i)      The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
         for its own account, an annual administrative fee and such other fees,
         if any, referred to in the Fee Letter and at the times specified in the
         Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be
         refundable for any reason whatsoever, unless otherwise indicated in the
         Fee Letter.

                                       11
<PAGE>
                  (ii)     The Company shall pay to the Lenders such fees as
         shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at
         the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and
         shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever, unless otherwise
         indicated in such writing.

         (c)      Letter of Credit Fees. In consideration of the issuance of
Letters of Credit hereunder, the Company promises to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") on such
Lender's Pro Rata Share (relative to the Revolving Committed Amount) of the
aggregate face amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, computed at a per annum
rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date of expiration equal to
the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans that are Revolving Loans. The Letter
of Credit Fee will be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of
each March, June, September and December and on the Revolving Credit Termination
Date or such earlier date as the Revolving Committed Amount shall terminate, in
each case calculated based upon the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day
year. In addition to the Letter of Credit Fee, the Company promises to pay to
the Issuing Lender for its own account without sharing by the other Lenders (i)
a fronting fee of .125% per annum on the aggregate stated amount of each
outstanding Letter of Credit for the stated duration thereof, payable quarterly
in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December
and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date or such earlier date as the
Revolving Committed Amount shall terminate, in each case calculated based upon
the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year and (ii) the customary and
reasonable charges from time to time of the Issuing Lender with respect to the
amendment, transfer, administration, cancellation and conversion of, and
drawings under, such Letters of Credit.

                           2.5.     TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF A REVOLVING
                                    COMMITTED AMOUNT.

         The Company shall have the right, upon not less than five Business
Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Revolving Committed
Amount or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Revolving Committed
Amount, provided, that the Company complies with any applicable provisions of
Section 2.6(b)(i). Any such reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount shall be
in an amount equal to $5,000,000 (or, if the then available amount of such
Revolving Committed Amount is less than $5,000,000, such lesser amount) or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce permanently such
Revolving Committed Amount then in effect.

                           2.6.     PREPAYMENTS.

         (a)      Optional Prepayments. The Company may on the last day of any
Interest Period with respect thereto, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, or at any
time and from time to time, in the case of ABR Loans, prepay, in whole or in
part, either the outstanding Revolving Loans or the outstanding Term Loans,
without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent
(which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 A.M.
(New York, New York time) (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the prepayment
date if all or any part of the Loans to be prepaid consist of Eurodollar Loans
and (ii) one (1) Business Day prior to the prepayment date, otherwise),
specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of
Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of

                                       12
<PAGE>
a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each. Upon receipt of any such
notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender
thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall
be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 3.5 and interest on the principal amount prepaid
through the date of prepayment. Partial prepayments of Revolving Loans or Term
Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Subject to the foregoing terms,
prepayments of Revolving Loans that are made under this Section 2.6(a) shall be
applied as the Company may elect; provided that if the Company fails to specify
the application of a voluntary prepayment of Revolving Loans then such
prepayment shall be applied first to ABR Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in
direct order of Interest Period maturities. Voluntary prepayments of the Term
Loans shall be applied to prepay on a pro rata basis the Term B Loan (pro rata
to the remaining amortization payments thereunder) and the Incremental Term Loan
(pro rata to the remaining amortization payments thereunder).

         (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                  (i)      Commitment Limitations. If at any time, (A) the
         aggregate outstanding amount of Revolving Loans plus Swingline Loans
         plus LOC Obligations shall exceed the Revolving Committed Amount at
         such time, (B) the aggregate outstanding amount of Swingline Loans
         shall exceed the Swingline Committed Amount or (C) the aggregate amount
         of LOC Obligations shall exceed the LOC Committed Amount, the Company
         shall immediately make payment on the Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans
         and/or to a cash collateral account in respect of the LOC Obligations,
         in an amount sufficient to eliminate the excess (such prepayment to be
         applied as set forth in clause (vi) below).

                  (ii)     Excess Cash Flow. Within 90 days after the end of
         each fiscal year (commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31,
         2003), the Company shall prepay the Loans in an amount equal to (A) 50%
         (if the Leverage Ratio as of the end of such fiscal year most recently
         ended for which the Company has delivered a compliance certificate
         pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(i) hereof is greater than 2.0 to 1.0) or 0%
         (if the Leverage Ratio as of the end of such fiscal year most recently
         ended for which the Company has delivered a compliance certificate
         pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(i) hereof is less than or equal to 2.0 to
         1.0) of Excess Cash Flow for such prior fiscal year minus (B) to the
         extent the amount determined pursuant to clause (A) above is greater
         than 0, the amount of any voluntary prepayments made during such fiscal
         year of the Term Loans or (to the extent accompanied by a permanent
         reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount) the Revolving Loans (such
         prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vi) below).

                  (iii)    Asset Dispositions. The Net Cash Proceeds from any
         Asset Disposition or Involuntary Disposition (including insurance and
         condemnation proceeds) received at any time by any Credit Party or any
         Subsidiary of a Credit Party may, within 270 days from the date of
         receipt, be applied (or caused to be applied) by the Company and its
         Consolidated Subsidiaries to make Eligible Reinvestments. If and
         whenever any such Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $15,000,000 in the
         aggregate from the Closing Date are not reinvested in Eligible
         Reinvestments prior to the expiration of such 270-day period, the
         Company shall,

                                       13
<PAGE>
         on the first Business Day thereafter, apply such excess unreinvested
         amount as set forth in clause (vi) below.

                  (iv)     Debt Issuances. Immediately upon receipt by the
         Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary of proceeds from any Debt
         Issuance, the Company shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount
         equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt Issuance (such
         prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vi) below).

                  (v)      Issuances of Equity. Immediately upon receipt by the
         Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary of proceeds from any Equity
         Issuance, the Company shall apply (A) 50% (if the Leverage Ratio as of
         the end of the fiscal quarter most recently ended for which the Company
         has delivered a compliance certificate pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(i)
         hereof is greater than 2.0 to 1.0) or 0% (if the Leverage Ratio as of
         the end of the fiscal quarter most recently ended for which the Company
         has delivered a compliance certificate pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(i)
         hereof is less than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0) of such Equity Issuance as
         set forth in clause (vi) below.

                  (vi)     Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All amounts
         required to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be applied as
         follows:

                           (A)      (1) with respect to all amounts prepaid
                  pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(i)(A) and (B), to Swingline Loans,
                  then to Revolving Loans and (after all Swingline Loans and
                  Revolving Loans have been repaid) to a cash collateral account
                  to cash collateralize outstanding LOC Obligations; and (2)
                  with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant to Section
                  2.6(b)(i)(C), to a cash collateral account to cash
                  collateralize outstanding LOC Obligations;

                           (B)      with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant
                  to Section 2.6(b)(iii), pro rata (1) to prepay the Term Loans
                  (pro rata to the Term B Loan (pro rata to the remaining
                  amortization payments thereunder) and the Incremental Term
                  Loan (pro rata to the remaining amortization payments
                  thereunder)) and (2) to reduce the Revolving Committed Amount
                  (and, to the extent outstanding, to prepay the Revolving Loans
                  and (after all Revolving Loans have been repaid) to cash
                  collateralize the LOC Obligations outstanding by a
                  corresponding amount), it being understood that, to the extent
                  that Revolving Loans and/or LOC Obligations are not
                  outstanding, the Company shall be entitled to retain the
                  portion of any prepayment amount applied to reduce the
                  Revolving Committed Amount in an aggregate amount equal to
                  such reduction; and

                           (C)      with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant
                  to Section 2.6(b)(ii), (iv) and (v), (1) until the Term Loans
                  have been paid in full, first to prepay the Term Loans (pro
                  rata to the Term B Loan (pro rata to the remaining
                  amortization payments thereunder) and the Incremental Term
                  Loan (pro rata to the remaining amortization payments
                  thereunder)) and (2) after the Term Loans have been paid in
                  full, to reduce the Revolving Committed Amount (and, to the
                  extent outstanding, to prepay first Swingline Loans and then
                  the Revolving Loans and (after all

                                       14
<PAGE>
                  Swingline Loans and Revolving Loans have been repaid) to cash
                  collateralize LOC Obligations by a corresponding amount), it
                  being understood that, to the extent that Revolving Loans
                  and/or LOC Obligations are not outstanding, the Company shall
                  be entitled to retain the portion of any prepayment amount
                  applied to reduce the Revolving Committed Amount in an
                  aggregate amount equal to such reduction.

         Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, each
mandatory prepayment required by this Section 2.6(b) shall be applied (i) with
regard to Revolving Loans, first to ABR Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in
direct order of Interest Period maturities and (ii) with regard to Term Loans,
pro rata to all outstanding Term Loans. Each such mandatory prepayment shall be
subject to Sections 2.6(c) and 3.5 and shall be accompanied by interest on the
principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

         (c)      Term Loan Refusal Option. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 2.6, in the case of each mandatory prepayment described
in Section 2.6(b) that is to be allocated to the Term Loans, the Company shall
give the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing)
at least five (5) Business Days (to the extent reasonably practicable) prior to
the date of such prepayment, requesting that the Administrative Agent prepare
and provide to each Lender holding any of the Term Loans a notice (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) to the effect
that such Lender has the right, at its option, so long as there are Swingline
Loans or Revolving Loans outstanding, to accept or decline its share of such
prepayment, and, under such circumstances, all amounts that would otherwise be
used to prepay the Term Loans as set forth above shall instead be used to prepay
first Swingline Loans and then Revolving Loans, and setting forth procedures
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent relating to the exercise of
such option. The Administrative Agent thereupon shall promptly prepare and
deliver such notice to such Lenders. Each such Lender shall be deemed to have
elected to accept or decline its share of such prepayment as determined by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the procedures set forth in the notice.

                           2.7.     CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION OPTIONS.

         (a)      The Company may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar
Loans to ABR Loans, giving the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Business
Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election on behalf of the Company
pursuant to a Notice of Continuation/Conversion, substantially in the form of
Exhibit F, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be
made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Company may
elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans, giving the
Administrative Agent at least three (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable notice
of such election on behalf of the Company. Any such notice of conversion to
Eurodollar Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period or
Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender thereof. All or any part of
outstanding Eurodollar Loans and ABR Loans may be converted as provided herein,
provided that (i) no ABR Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) no ABR Loan may be
converted into a Eurodollar Loan after the date that is one month prior to the
respective Termination Date.

                                       15
<PAGE>
         (b)      Any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as a Eurodollar Loan upon
the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the
Company giving notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section 7, of
the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans, provided
that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such (i) when any Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing or (ii) after the date that is one month prior to
the respective Termination Date and provided, further, that if the Company shall
fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such
continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso, such Loans
shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans.

                           2.8.     MAXIMUM NUMBER OF EURODOLLAR LOANS.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) no more
than six (6) Eurodollar Loans shall be outstanding under each of the Revolving
Committed Amount, the Term B Loan and the Incremental Term Loan and (b) no more
than twelve (12) Eurodollar Loans in the aggregate shall be outstanding
hereunder, at any time (it being understood that, for purposes hereof,
Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods shall be considered as separate
Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on the same date, although borrowings,
continuations and conversions may, in accordance with the provisions hereof, be
combined at the end of existing Interest Periods to constitute a new Eurodollar
Loan with a single Interest Period).

                           2.9.     INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES.

         (a)      Each Eurodollar Loan that is a Revolving Loan shall bear
interest for each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal
to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such Interest Period plus the Applicable
Margin for Eurodollar Loans that are Revolving Loans.

         (b)      Each Eurodollar Loan under the Term B Loan shall bear interest
for each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the
Eurodollar Rate determined for such Interest Period plus 3.25%.

         (c)      Each ABR Loan that is a Revolving Loan shall bear interest at
a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin for ABR Loans that
are Revolving Loans.

         (d)      Each ABR Loan under the Term B Loan shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to the ABR plus 2.25%.

         (e)      If any amount payable by the Company under any Credit Document
is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether
at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter
bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law.
Furthermore, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of
Default exists, the Company shall pay interest on the principal amount of all
outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at
all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Requirements of Law. Accrued and unpaid

                                       16
<PAGE>
interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be
due and payable upon demand.

         (f)      Interest on Revolving Loans and the Term Loans shall be
payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, provided that interest
accruing pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.9 shall be payable from
time to time on demand.

         (g)      The principal amount of, and any unpaid interest on, all Loans
shall be due and payable in full on the respective Termination Date unless
accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 6.1 or unless subject to a mandatory
prepayment required by Section 2.6(b).

         (h)      The Swingline Loans shall bear interest, and such interest
shall be payable, as specified in Section 2.13(c).

         (i)      Each Eurodollar Loan under the Incremental Term Loan shall
bear interest for each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum
equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such Interest Period plus the
applicable margin agreed to among the Company and the Lenders making the
Incremental Term Loan.

         (j)      Each ABR Loan under the Incremental Term Loan shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the applicable margin agreed
to among the Company and the Lenders making the Incremental Term Loan.

                           2.10.    COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.

         (a)      Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the Commitment
Fees and interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the
actual days elapsed, except with respect to computation of interest on ABR Loans
determined by reference to the Prime Rate (as defined in the definition of
"ABR"), which shall be calculated based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as
appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the
Company and the applicable Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate.
Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or
the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening
of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The
Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Company and the
Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest
rate.

         (b)      Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on the Credit Parties and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.
The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Company, deliver to the
Company a statement showing the calculations of the Administrative Agent in
determining the Eurodollar Rate.

                           2.11.    PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS.

         (a)      Each borrowing of Revolving Loans or Term Loans by the Company
from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Company on account of the
Commitment Fee and the

                                       17
<PAGE>
Letter of Credit Fee hereunder and any reduction of the Commitments of the
Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Pro Rata Shares of
the applicable Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Company
or another Credit Party on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving
Loans, the Term Loans or other extensions of credit shall be made pro rata
according to the respective amounts of principal and interest then due and owing
to the applicable Lenders except to the extent otherwise elected by the Lenders
holding the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.6(c). All payments (including
prepayments) to be made by the Company or another Credit Party hereunder,
whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made
without set off or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York,
New York time) on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the applicable Lenders (unless such payment is for the Administrative
Agent's own account) at the Administrative Agent's office specified in Section
9.2, in immediately available funds. If applicable, the Administrative Agent
shall distribute such payments to the applicable Lenders promptly upon receipt
in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on
Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with
respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then
applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan
becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such
extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which
event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

         (b)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the
amount that would constitute its portion of such borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is
making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a
corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent in such circumstances, makes
available to the Company such corresponding amount and such Lender does not make
available such ratable portion of such borrowing to the Administrative Agent by
the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, on demand, its portion of such borrowing with interest
thereon at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the
definition of "ABR") for the period until such Lender makes such amount
immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the
Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing
under this subsection shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If
such Lender's portion of such borrowing is not made available to the
Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing
Date, the Administrative Agent, having made available to the Company a
corresponding amount, shall also be entitled to recover such corresponding
amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans, on
demand, from the Company. Nothing contained in this Section 2.11(b) shall
relieve any Lender which has failed to make available its portion of any
borrowing hereunder from its obligation to do so in accordance with the terms
hereof.

                           2.12.    TAXES.

                                       18
<PAGE>
         All payments made by a Credit Party under this Agreement shall be made
free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of,
any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied,
collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net
income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed
on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former
connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction
of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein (other than to the extent any such
connection arose from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed,
delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced,
this Agreement or any other Credit Document). If any such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings
("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the Notes, the amounts
so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the
extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after
payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable
hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents; provided, however, that no Credit Party shall be
required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender that is not
organized under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof if
such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection. Whenever
any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by a Credit Party, as promptly as possible
thereafter such Credit Party shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own
account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy
of an original official receipt received by such Credit Party showing payment
thereof. If a Credit Party fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the
appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the
required receipts or other required documentary evidence, such Credit Party
shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental
taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent
or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this subsection
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
and all amounts payable hereunder or thereunder.

                           2.13.    SWINGLINE LOAN SUBFACILITY.

         (a)      Swingline Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein,
the Swingline Lender, in its individual capacity, agrees to make certain
revolving credit loans requested by the Company to the Company in Dollars (each
a "Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the "Swingline Loans") from time to time
during the Commitment Period for the purposes hereinafter set forth; provided,
however, (i) the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at
any time shall not exceed TEN MILLION DOLLARS ($10,000,000) (the "Swingline
Committed Amount"), and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Revolving Loans plus outstanding Swingline Loans plus all outstanding LOC
Obligations shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. Swingline Loans
hereunder shall be made as ABR Loans in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.13, and may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
hereof. No Swingline Loans shall be made on the Closing Date.

                                       19
<PAGE>
         (b)      Swingline Loan Advances.

                  (i)      Notices; Disbursement. Whenever the Company desires a
         Swingline Loan advance hereunder it shall give written notice (or
         telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Swingline
         Lender not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York, New York time) on the
         Business Day of the requested Swingline Loan advance. Each such notice
         shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A) that a Swingline Loan
         advance is requested, (B) the date of the requested Swingline Loan
         advance (which shall be a Business Day) and (C) the principal amount of
         the Swingline Loan advance requested. Each Swingline Loan shall be made
         as an ABR Loan and shall have, subject to clause (iii) below, such
         maturity date as the Swingline Lender and the Company shall agree upon
         receipt by the Swingline Lender of any such notice from the Company.
         The Swingline Lender shall initiate the transfer of funds representing
         the Swingline Loan advance to the Company by 3:00 P.M. (New York, New
         York time) on the Business Day of the requested borrowing.

                  (ii)     Minimum Amounts. Each Swingline Loan advance shall be
         in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples
         of $500,000 in excess thereof (or the remaining amount of the Swingline
         Committed Amount, if less).

                  (iii)    Repayment of Swingline Loans. The principal amount of
         all Swingline Loans shall be due and payable on the earlier of (A) the
         maturity date agreed to by the Swingline Lender and the Company with
         respect to such Loan (which maturity date shall not be a date more than
         five (5) Business Days from the date of the earliest advance thereof)
         and (B) the Revolving Credit Termination Date. The Swingline Lender
         may, at any time, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the
         Company and the Lenders, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans
         advanced in accordance with the terms hereof by way of a Revolving Loan
         advance on the Business Day following the date of such notice, in which
         case the Company shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan
         advance comprised solely of ABR Loans in the amount of such Swingline
         Loans; provided, however, that any such demand shall be deemed to have
         been given one (1) Business Day prior to the Revolving Credit
         Termination Date and on the date of the occurrence of any Event of
         Default described in Section 6.1(f) or Section 6.1(g) and upon
         acceleration of the indebtedness hereunder and the exercise of remedies
         in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1. Each Lender hereby
         irrevocably agrees to make its Pro Rata Share of each such Revolving
         Loan in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified in the
         preceding sentence notwithstanding (I) the amount of such borrowing may
         not comply with the minimum amount for advances of Revolving Loans
         otherwise required hereunder, (II) whether any conditions specified in
         Section 4.2 are then satisfied, (III) whether a Default or an Event of
         Default then exists, (IV) failure of any such request or deemed request
         for a Revolving Loan to be made by the time otherwise required
         hereunder, (V) whether the date of such borrowing is a date on which
         Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (VI)
         any termination of the Commitments relating thereto immediately prior
         to or contemporaneously with such borrowing. In the event that any
         Revolving Loan cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise
         required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the
         commencement of a proceeding under Debtor Relief Laws with respect to
         the Company), then each Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith
         purchase (as of the date such borrowing would

                                       20
<PAGE>
         otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from
         the Company on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from the
         Swingline Lender such Participation Interest in the outstanding
         Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause each such Lender to
         share in such Swingline Loans ratably based upon its respective Pro
         Rata Share (determined before giving effect to any termination of the
         Commitments pursuant to Section 2.5), provided that (A) all interest
         payable on the Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the
         Swingline Lender until the date as of which the respective
         Participation Interest is purchased and (B) at the time any purchase of
         Participation Interests pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the
         purchasing Lender shall be required to pay to the Swingline Lender, to
         the extent not paid to the Swingline Lender by the Company in
         accordance with the terms of subsection (c)(ii) below, interest on the
         principal amount of Participation Interests purchased for each day from
         and including the day upon which such purchase of Participation
         Interests would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of
         actual payment for the purchase of such Participation Interests, at the
         rate equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the
         definition of "ABR").

         (c)      Interest on Swingline Loans.

                  (i)      Subject to the provisions of Section 2.9(e), each
         Swingline Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate (computed on the
         basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365/366 days)
         equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin for ABR Loans that are
         Revolving Loans.

                  (ii)     Payment of Interest. Interest on Swingline Loans
         shall be payable in arrears on each applicable Interest Payment Date
         (or at such other times as may be specified herein), unless accelerated
         sooner pursuant to Section 6.1.

         (d)      Note Evidencing Swingline Loans. The Swingline Loans shall be
evidenced, at the Swingline Lender's request, by a duly executed Note of the
Company in the form of Exhibit A to the Swingline Lender.

                           2.14.    LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

         (a)      Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and of
the LOC Documents, if any, and any other terms and conditions which the Issuing
Lender may reasonably require, during the Commitment Period the Issuing Lender
shall issue, and the Lenders shall participate in, Letters of Credit for the
account of the Company from time to time upon request in a form acceptable to
the Issuing Lender; provided, however, that (i) the aggregate amount of
outstanding LOC Obligations shall not at any time exceed ONE HUNDRED MILLION
DOLLARS ($100,000,000) (the "LOC Committed Amount"), (ii) the sum of the
aggregate amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus Swingline Loans plus LOC
Obligations shall not at any time exceed the aggregate Revolving Committed
Amount then in effect, (iii) all Letters of Credit shall be denominated in
Dollars, and (iv) Letters of Credit shall be issued for a purpose described in
Section 1.6 and may be issued as standby letters of credit or trade letters of
credit. Except as otherwise expressly agreed upon by all the Lenders, no Letter
of Credit shall have an original expiry date more than twelve (12) months from
the date of issuance; provided, however,

                                       21
<PAGE>
so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and
subject to the other terms and conditions to the issuance of Letters of Credit
hereunder, the expiry dates of Letters of Credit may be extended annually or
periodically from time to time on the request of the Company or by operation of
the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit to a date not more than twelve (12)
months from the date of extension; provided, further, that no Letter of Credit,
as originally issued or as extended, shall have an expiry date extending beyond
the fifth day prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Each Letter of
Credit shall comply with the related LOC Documents. The issuance and expiry date
of each Letter of Credit shall be a Business Day.

         (b)      Request for Issuance, Notices and Reports. The request for the
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be submitted by the Company to the
Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Issuing Lender) at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance. Promptly after receipt of
any application for any Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent will (i)
confirm with the Issuing Lender (by telephone or in writing) that the Issuing
Lender has received a copy of such application for such Letter of Credit from
the Company and, if not, the Administrative Agent will provide the Issuing
Lender with a copy thereof and (ii) provide confirmation to the Issuing Lender
that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the
terms hereof (such confirmation shall be provided to the Issuing Lender no later
than the next Business Day following the Administrative Agent's receipt of a
copy of such application for a Letter of Credit). Following such confirmation
from the Administrative Agent, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
Issuing Lender shall, on or before the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit
for the account of the Company or enter into the applicable amendment, as the
case may be, in each case in accordance with the Issuing Lender's usual and
customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of
Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Lender a risk participation
in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the Lender's Pro Rata Share of
such Letter of Credit. Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or
any amendment to any Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing
Lender will also deliver to the Company and to the Administrative Agent a true
and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. The Issuing Lender
will, at least quarterly and more frequently upon request, disseminate to the
Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders a detailed report specifying the
Letters of Credit which are then issued and outstanding and any activity with
respect thereto which may have occurred since the date of the prior report, and
including therein, among other things, the beneficiary, the face amount and the
expiry date, as well as any payment or expirations which may have occurred.

         (c)      Participation. Each Lender, upon issuance of a Letter of
Credit, shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a Participation
Interest from the Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit and the obligations
arising thereunder and any collateral relating thereto, in each case in an
amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the obligations under such Letter of
Credit and shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume and be
obligated to pay to the Issuing Lender and discharge when due, its Pro Rata
Share of the obligations arising under such Letter of Credit in accordance with
Section 2.14(d) below. Without limiting the scope and nature of each Lender's
Participation Interest in any Letter of Credit, to the extent that the Issuing
Lender has not been reimbursed as required hereunder or under any such Letter of
Credit, each such Lender shall pay to the Issuing Lender its Pro Rata Share of
such unreimbursed drawing in same day funds on the day of notification by the
Issuing Lender of an unreimbursed drawing pursuant to the provisions of

                                       22
<PAGE>
subsection (d) below. The obligation of each Lender to so reimburse the Issuing
Lender shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by the
occurrence of a Default, an Event of Default or any other occurrence or event.
Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of
the Company to reimburse the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together
with interest as hereinafter provided.

         (d)      Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any Letter of
Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the
Company. Unless the Company shall immediately notify the Administrative Agent
and the Issuing Lender that the Company intends to otherwise reimburse the
Issuing Lender through the Administrative Agent for such drawing, the Company
shall be deemed to have requested that the Lenders make Revolving Loans totaling
the amount of the drawing as provided in subsection (e) below on the related
Letter of Credit, the proceeds of which will be used to satisfy the related
reimbursement obligations. The Company promises to reimburse the Issuing Lender
on the Business Day of any drawing under any Letter of Credit (either with the
proceeds of a Revolving Loan obtained hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds.
If the Company shall fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender as provided
hereinabove, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear interest at a
per annum rate equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin for ABR Loans that
are Revolving Loans plus 2%. The Company's reimbursement obligations hereunder
shall be absolute and unconditional under all circumstances irrespective of any
rights of setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment the Company may claim or
have against the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the
beneficiary of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other Person, including
without limitation any defense based on any failure of the Company or any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries to receive consideration or the legality, validity,
regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender will
promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the amount of any unreimbursed
drawing and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of such
amount of any unreimbursed drawing. Each Lender shall promptly pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in immediately
available funds, the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such unreimbursed
drawing. Such payment shall be made on the day such notice is received by such
Lender from the Administrative Agent if such notice is received at or before
2:00 P.M. (New York, New York time); otherwise such payment shall be made at or
before 12:00 Noon (New York, New York time) on the Business Day next succeeding
the day such notice is received. If such Lender does not pay such amount to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in full upon such
request, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the period
from the date of such drawing until such Lender pays such amount to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in full at a rate per
annum equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of the date that such
Lender is required to make payments of such amount pursuant to the preceding
sentence, the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the definition of
"ABR") and thereafter at a rate equal to the ABR. Each Lender's obligation to
make such payment to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing
Lender, and the right of the Issuing Lender to receive the same, shall be
absolute and unconditional, shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever
and without regard to the termination of this Agreement or the Commitments
hereunder, the existence of a Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of
the obligations of the Company hereunder and shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Simultaneously with the making
of each such payment by a Lender to the Issuing Lender (through the

                                       23
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent), such Lender shall, automatically and without any further
action on the part of the Issuing Lender or such Lender, acquire a Participation
Interest in an amount equal to such payment (excluding the portion of such
payment constituting interest owing to the Issuing Lender) in the related
unreimbursed drawing portion of the LOC Obligation and in the interest thereon
and in the related LOC Documents, and shall have a claim against the Company
with respect thereto.

         (e)      Repayment with proceeds of Revolving Loans. On any day on
which the Company shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a
Revolving Loan advance to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the
Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that a Revolving Loan has
been requested or deemed requested by the Company to be made in connection with
a drawing under a Letter of Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan advance,
comprised of ABR Loans (or Eurodollar Loans to the extent the Company has
complied with the procedures of Section 2.3 with respect thereto), shall be
immediately made to the Company by all Lenders, as applicable (notwithstanding
any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 6.1), pro rata based on
their respective Pro Rata Shares (determined before giving effect to any
termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 6.1) and the proceeds thereof
shall be paid directly to the Issuing Lender for application to the respective
LOC Obligations. Each such Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make its Pro Rata
Share of each such Revolving Loan immediately upon any such request or deemed
request in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified in the preceding
sentence notwithstanding (i) the amount of such borrowing may not comply with
the minimum amount for advances of Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder,
(ii) whether any conditions specified in Section 4.2 are then satisfied, (iii)
whether a Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such
request or deemed request for Revolving Loans to be made by the time otherwise
required hereunder, (v) whether the date of such borrowing is a date on which
Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (vi) any
termination of the Commitments relating thereto immediately prior to or
contemporaneously with such borrowing. In the event that any Revolving Loan
cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including,
without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under Debtor
Relief Laws with respect to the Company or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries), then each such Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith
purchase (as of the date such borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but
adjusted for any payments received from the Company on or after such date and
prior to such purchase) from the Issuing Lender such Participation Interests in
the outstanding LOC Obligations as shall be necessary to cause each such Lender
to share in such LOC Obligations ratably (based upon the respective Pro Rata
Shares of such Lenders (determined before giving effect to any termination of
the Commitments pursuant to Section 6.1)), provided that at the time any
purchase of Participation Interests pursuant to this sentence is actually made,
the purchasing Lender shall be required to pay to the Issuing Lender, to the
extent not paid to the Issuing Lender by the Company in accordance with the
terms of subsection (d) above, interest on the principal amount of Participation
Interests purchased for each day from and including the day upon which such
borrowing would otherwise have occurred but excluding the date of payment for
such Participation Interests, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2)
Business Days of the date of the Revolving Loan advance, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate (as defined in the definition of "ABR"), and thereafter at a rate
equal to the ABR.

         (f)      Designation of Consolidated Subsidiaries as Account Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, including
without limitation Section 2.14(a), a

                                       24
<PAGE>
Letter of Credit issued hereunder may contain a statement to the effect that
such Letter of Credit is issued for the account of a Consolidated Subsidiary of
the Company, provided that notwithstanding such statement, the Company shall be
the actual account party for all purposes of this Agreement for such Letter of
Credit and such statement shall not affect the Company's reimbursement
obligations hereunder with respect to such Letter of Credit.

         (g)      Renewal, Extension. The renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as the
issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

         (h)      Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly
agreed by the Issuing Lender and the Company when a Letter of Credit is issued,
(i) the rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998" published by the
Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof
as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter
of Credit, and (ii) The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as
most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC") at the
time of issuance (including the ICC decision published by the Commission on
Banking Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998 regarding the European single
currency (euro)) shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

         (i)      Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender's Duties.

                  (i)      In addition to its other obligations under this
         Section 2.14, the Company hereby agrees to pay, and protect, indemnify
         and save each Lender (including the Issuing Lender) harmless from and
         against, any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses,
         costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
         expenses) that such Lender may incur or be subject to as a
         consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance of any Letter of
         Credit or (B) the failure of such Lender or the Issuing Lender to
         honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or
         omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de
         jure or de facto government or Governmental Authority that impacts,
         directly or indirectly, any such Letter of Credit (all such acts or
         omissions, herein called "Government Acts").

                  (ii)     As between the Company and the Lenders (including the
         Issuing Lender), the Company shall assume all risks of the acts,
         omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary
         thereof. No Lender (including the Issuing Lender) shall be
         responsible: (A) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
         genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in
         connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of
         Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
         invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) for the
         validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
         purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or
         benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may
         prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) for errors,
         omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
         messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or
         not they be in cipher; (D) for any loss or delay in the transmission
         or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under
         a Letter of Credit or of the

                                       25
<PAGE>
         proceeds thereof; and (E) for any consequences arising from causes
         beyond the control of such Lender, including, without limitation, any
         Government Acts. None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the
         vesting of the Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

                  (iii)    In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of
         the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or
         omitted by any Lender (including the Issuing Lender), under or in
         connection with any Letter of Credit or the related certificates, if
         taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Lender under any
         resulting liability to the Company. It is the intention of the parties
         that this Agreement shall be construed and applied to protect and
         indemnify each Lender (including the Issuing Lender) against any and
         all risks involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of
         which risks are hereby assumed by the Company (on behalf of itself and
         each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries), including, without limitation,
         any and all Government Acts. No Lender (including the Issuing Lender)
         shall, in any way, be liable for any failure by such Lender or anyone
         else to pay any drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any
         Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control of such Lender.

                  (iv)     Nothing in this subsection (i) is intended to limit
         the reimbursement obligations of the Company contained in subsection
         (d) above. The obligations of the Company under this subsection (i)
         shall survive the termination of this Agreement. No act or omission of
         any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any
         way affect or impair the rights of the Lenders (including the Issuing
         Lender) to enforce any right, power or benefit under this Agreement.

                  (v)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         this subsection (i), the Company shall have no obligation to indemnify
         any Lender (including the Issuing Lender) in respect of any liability
         incurred by such Lender (A) to the extent such liability arose out of
         the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender, as
         determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (B) caused by such
         Lender's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after presentation
         to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of
         such Letter of Credit, as determined by a court of competent
         jurisdiction, unless such payment is prohibited by any law,
         regulation, court order or decree.

         (j)      Responsibility of Issuing Lender. It is expressly understood
and agreed that the obligations of the Issuing Lender hereunder to the Lenders
are only those expressly set forth in this Agreement and that the Issuing Lender
shall be entitled to assume that the conditions precedent set forth in Section
4.2 have been satisfied unless it shall have acquired actual knowledge that any
such condition precedent has not been satisfied; provided, however, that nothing
set forth in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any
Lender to recover from the Issuing Lender any amounts made available by such
Lender to the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14 in the event that it
is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with
respect to a Letter of Credit constituted gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender.

         (k)      Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any conflict
between this Agreement and any LOC Document (including any letter of credit
application), this Agreement shall control.

                           2.15.    TERM B LOAN.

         (a)      Term B Loan Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein
each Lender severally agrees to make available to the Company on the Closing
Date such Lenders' Pro Rata Share of a term loan in the aggregate principal
amount of TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($200,000,000) (the "Term B Loan"). The
Term B Loan may consist of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans, or a combination
thereof, as the Company may request. Amounts borrowed under the Term B Loan that
are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.

         (b)      Borrowing Procedures. The Term B Loan must be drawn in a
single drawing on the Closing Date and shall be subject to the following
procedures: The Company shall submit an appropriate notice of borrowing,
substantially in the form of Exhibit E, to the Administrative Agent not later
than 11:00 A.M. (New York, New York time) on the Closing Date with respect to
that portion of the Term B Loan initially consisting of an ABR Loan, or on (or
before) the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date with respect to that
portion of the Term B Loan initially consisting of one or more Eurodollar Loans
(provided that, in regard to Eurodollar Loans, if the Company submits a notice
of borrowing prior to the Closing Date, such notice of borrowing shall be
accompanied by a funding indemnity letter in form and substance satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent), which notice of borrowing shall be irrevocable and
shall specify (i) that the funding of the Term B Loan is requested, (ii) whether
the funding of the Term B Loan shall be comprised of ABR Loans, Eurodollar Loans
or a combination thereof, (iii) if Eurodollar Loans are requested, the Interest
Period(s) therefor, and (iv) remittance instructions. If the Company shall fail
to deliver such notice of borrowing to the Administrative Agent by 11:00 A.M.
(New York, New York time) on the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date
then the full amount of the Term B Loan shall be disbursed on the Closing Date
as an ABR Loan. Each Lender shall make its Pro Rata Share of the Term B Loan
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Company at the
office of the Administrative Agent specified in Section 9.2, or at such other
office as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing, by 1:00 P.M. (New
York, New York time) on the Closing Date in funds immediately available to the
Administrative Agent. The Term B Loan will then be made available to the Company
by the Administrative Agent crediting the account of the Company as set forth on
the notice of borrowing with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the
Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent.

         (c)      Minimum Amounts. Each Eurodollar Loan or ABR Loan that is part
of the Term B Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less
than $5,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 (or, in the case of an
ABR Loan only, the then remaining principal balance of that portion of the Term
B Loan available, if less).

         (d)      Repayment of Term B Loan. The principal amount of the Term B
Loan shall be repaid on each of the Principal Amortization Payment Dates set
forth below with a quarterly payment on each such date equal to the amount set
forth below corresponding to the relevant Principal Amortization Payment Date,
unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 6.1:

         (e)      Interest. The Term B Loan shall bear interest, and such
interest shall be payable, as specified in Section 2.9.

         (f)      Notes Evidencing Term B Loan. The portion of the Term B Loan
made by a Lender shall be, at the request of such Lender, evidenced by a duly
executed Note in the form of Exhibit A of the Company to such Lender.

                           2.16.    INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN.

         (a)      Incremental Term Loan. At any time prior to the Incremental
Term Loan Availability Expiration Date, subject to the requirements of this
Section 2.16 and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement and in
reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
herein, the Company may propose to incur an Incremental Term Loan in accordance
with clause (b) of this Section 2.16 in an aggregate amount of at least FIFTY
MILLION DOLLARS ($50,000,000) and of no more than ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION
DOLLARS ($150,000,000) (the "Incremental Term Loan"). The Incremental Term Loan
shall have terms identical to the Term B Loan; provided that (i) fees payable to
lenders for their Incremental Term Loan commitments and (ii) interest payable on
the Incremental Term Loan will, in each case, be as determined at the time such
commitments becomes effective. The Incremental Term Loan may only be incurred
(x) so long as no Default or Event of Default exists at the time of funding or
would result therefrom (on a Pro Forma Basis or otherwise) and (y) so long as at
the time of funding the Company can demonstrate that the Secured Leverage Ratio
is

                                       28
<PAGE>
less than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 on a Pro Forma Basis. Amounts borrowed under
the Incremental Term Loan that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.

         (b)      Procedure for Requesting Incremental Term Loan. If the Company
desires to incur the Incremental Term Loan, the Company may request any one or
more Lenders, selected by the Company in its sole discretion, to fund all or any
portion of the Incremental Term Loan up to a stated maximum aggregate principal
amount and at proposed interest rates and fees for the Incremental Term Loan set
forth in such request (provided that such terms shall be in accordance with this
Section 2.16 and provided further that the Company shall, concurrently with such
request, notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall
thereafter notify all Lenders, of such request). Any Lender requested by the
Company to do so may (but is not obligated to) fund all or any portion of the
Incremental Term Loan. If Lenders (including Lenders not initially selected by
the Company) are not willing to provide all of the Incremental Term Loan
requested on the proposed terms, with the written consent of the Administrative
Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), the Company may request
one or more Persons meeting the requirements of the definition of "Eligible
Assignee" (each a "Prospective Lender"), by execution of an Incremental Term
Loan Acceptance substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereunder, to become a
Lender hereunder and to fund all or any portion of the Incremental Term Loan. If
one or more Lenders or Prospective Lenders agree to provide the Incremental Term
Loan, the Company shall give written notice to the Administrative Agent
specifying the aggregate amount of the Incremental Term Loan to be made, the
amount of the Incremental Term Loan to be made by each Lender or Prospective
Lender, based on such Lender's Pro Rata Share, the proposed funding date of the
Incremental Term Loan (the "Incremental Term Loan Funding Date") and the
interest rates and fees payable with respect to the Incremental Term Loan. The
Company and the Administrative Agent shall agree in writing on all conditions
(in addition to those specified in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3) to the making of
such Incremental Term Loan. Upon the making of the Incremental Term Loan,
Section 2.16(d) shall be deemed amended to provide for the amount and date of
the scheduled payments of principal thereon and Section 2.9 shall be deemed
amended to specify the interest rate or rates applicable to the Incremental Term
Loan. The Company shall pay to Administrative Agent (for distribution to each
Lender making the Incremental Term Loan) the fees payable for the Incremental
Term Loan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the
event that the Incremental Term Loan Yield received by any Lender with respect
to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Incremental Term Loan, exceeds the Term B
Yield received by any Lender with respect to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Term B Loan by an amount in excess of 0.25% (the amount of such excess, the
"Differential Yield Amount"), the Company shall, in conjunction with the funding
of the Incremental Term Loan, (i) increase the margin for Eurodollar Loans with
respect to the Term B Loan and the margin for ABR Loans with respect to the Term
B Loan (in each case as set forth in Section 2.9) (it being understood that any
such increase of the margin with respect to the Term B Loan shall remain in
effect for the term of this Agreement, subject to any additional increase
pursuant to this provision), and/or (ii) pay upfront fees to the Lenders (based
on each Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Term B Loan), in an aggregate amount
equal to the Differential Yield Amount (taking into account the remaining term
to final maturity of the Term B Loan); provided that in any event, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assure that the increase pursuant
to clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be allocated across such clauses on a
substantially similar basis to the allocation of the Incremental

                                       29
<PAGE>
Term Loan Yield across the Incremental Term Loan Excess Yield and the margin
with respect to the Incremental Term Loan.

         The Incremental Term Loan must be drawn in a single drawing on the
Incremental Term Loan Funding Date. The Company shall submit an appropriate
notice of borrowing, substantially in the form of Exhibit D, to the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York, New York time) on the
Incremental Term Loan Funding Date with respect to that portion of the
Incremental Term Loan initially consisting of an ABR Loan, or on (or before) the
third Business Day prior to the Incremental Term Loan Funding Date with respect
to that portion of the Incremental Term Loan initially consisting of one or more
Eurodollar Loans, which notice of borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall
specify (i) that the funding of the Incremental Term Loan is requested, (ii) the
aggregate amount of the Incremental Term Loan to be funded, (iii) whether the
funding of the Incremental Term Loan shall be comprised of ABR Loans, Eurodollar
Loans or a combination thereof, (iv) if Eurodollar Loans are requested, the
Interest Period(s) therefor and (v) remittance instructions. If the Company
shall fail to indicate whether the Incremental Term Loan is to be initially
funded as Eurodollar Rate Loans or ABR Loans by 11:00 A.M. (New York, New York
time) on the third Business Day prior to the Incremental Term Loan Funding Date,
then the full amount of the Incremental Term Loan shall be disbursed on the
Incremental Term Loan Funding Date as an ABR Loan. Each Lender shall make its
Pro Rata Share of the Incremental Term Loan available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Company at the office of the Administrative Agent
specified in Section 9.2, or at such other office as the Administrative Agent
may designate in writing, by 1:00 P.M. (New York, New York time) on the Closing
Date in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent. The Incremental
Term Loan will then be made available to the Company by the Administrative Agent
crediting the account of the Company as set forth on the notice of borrowing
with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by
the Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

         (c)      Minimum Amounts. Each Eurodollar Loan or ABR Loan that is part
of the Incremental Term Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is
not less than $5,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 (or, in the
case of an ABR Loan only, the then remaining principal balance of that portion
of the Incremental Term Loan available, if less).

         (d)      Repayment of Incremental Term Loan. The principal amount of
the Incremental Term Loan shall be repaid on the amortization schedule agreed to
among the Company and the Lenders making the Incremental Term Loan, unless
accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 6.1.

         (e)      Interest. The Incremental Term Loan shall bear interest, and
such interest shall be payable, as specified in Section 2.9.

         (f)      Notes Evidencing Incremental Term Loan. The portion of the
Incremental Term Loan made by a Lender shall be, at the request of such Lender,
evidenced by a duly executed Note in the form of Exhibit A of the Company to
such Lender.

         SECTION 3. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING LOANS.

                           3.1.     BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE
                                    INADEQUATE OR UNFAIR.

         If before the beginning of any Interest Period applicable to a
Eurodollar Loan:

                           (i)      by reason of circumstances affecting the
                   interbank eurodollar market generally, deposits in Dollars
                   are not being offered by the Administrative Agent in the
                   interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period;

                           (ii)     the Required Lenders shall determine that
                   the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such
                   Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the
                   cost to such Lenders of maintaining or funding, for such
                   Interest Period, their Eurodollar Loans to which such
                   Interest Period applies; or

                           (iii)    the Administrative Agent is unable to
                   determine the London Interbank Offered Rate;

the Administrative Agent (upon receipt of notice from the Required Lenders in
the case of clause (ii) above) shall forthwith give notice thereof to the
Company whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist (A) the obligations
of the Lenders to make the affected Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended and (B)
the Company shall repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each
affected Eurodollar Loan received by it, together with accrued interest thereon,
on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loan or
convert the then outstanding principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan on the
last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loan to an ABR
Loan.

                           3.2.     ILLEGALITY.

         If, after the date of this Agreement, the introduction of, or any
change in, any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
Governmental Authority shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to
make, maintain or fund its Eurodollar Loans, such Lender forthwith shall so
notify the Company. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall prepay in
full the then outstanding principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan of such
Lender received by it, together with accrued interest thereon, or convert the
then outstanding principal amount of each such Eurodollar Loan to an ABR Loan,
in either case, on either (a) the last day of the then current Interest Period
applicable to such Eurodollar Loan if such Lender may lawfully continue to
maintain and fund such Loan to such day or (b) immediately if such Lender may
not lawfully continue to fund and maintain such Loan to such day.

                           3.3.     INCREASED COST.

         (a)      If, after the date of this Agreement, the introduction of, or
any change in, any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation
or administration thereof by any

                                       31
<PAGE>
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Lender with any
request or directive of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or
comparable agency (whether or not having the force of law):

                  (i)      shall subject any Lender to any tax, duty or other
         charge with respect to any Loan made by it or any Letter of Credit, or
         its obligation to make or issue any of the foregoing, or shall change
         the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender of the principal of
         or interest on any Loan made by it or any Letter of Credit, or its
         obligation to make or issue any of the foregoing (except for changes
         in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender imposed by
         the jurisdiction, at any level, in which the principal executive
         office of such Lender is located); or

                  (ii)     shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
         (including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board of
         Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special deposit or similar
         requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
         credit extended by, any Lender or shall impose on any Lender or the
         interbank eurodollar market any other condition affecting its
         Eurodollar Loans or its other Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making or maintaining its Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of
Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender
under this Agreement or any other Credit Document by any amount deemed by such
Lender to be material, then, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written
demand from such Lender, the Company agrees to pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduction. A certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for determining such additional amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                  (b)      If any Lender shall have determined that the
         introduction of any applicable law, rule, regulation or guideline
         regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or any change in the
         interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
         or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such
         Lender with any request, guideline or directive regarding capital
         adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
         Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, affects or
         would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be
         maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
         and such Lender (taking into consideration such Lender's or such
         corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such
         Lender's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such
         capital is increased as a consequence of such Lender's obligations
         under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such Lender, the Company
         shall immediately pay to such Lender, from time to time as specified
         by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
          Lender for such increase, to the extent related to the Loans made to
          the Company. A certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable
          detail the basis for determining any such additional amounts payable
          pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be

                                       32
<PAGE>
          submitted by such Lender through the Administrative Agent to the
          Company and shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                           3.4.     EFFECT ON OBLIGATION TO CONVERT.

         If notice has been given pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2 hereof
requiring the Eurodollar Loans of any Lender to be prepaid or converted, then,
unless and until such Lender notifies the Company that the circumstances giving
rise to such prepayment or conversion no longer apply, the obligation of such
Lender to make or convert to Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended.

                           3.5.     FUNDING LOSSES.

         The Company shall pay to each Lender, upon written request, such amount
or amounts as shall compensate such Lender for any loss or expense incurred by
such Lender (including, without limitation, any loss or expense incurred by
reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by
such Lender to fund or maintain its Eurodollar Loans made to the Company) as a
result of (i) any payment or prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan on a
date other than a date which is the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Loan or any payment in respect of increased costs to such Lender,
whether pursuant to Section 2.6(a), Section 3.2, Section 3.3 or Section 6.1
hereof or otherwise or (ii) any failure by the Company to borrow or prepay a
Eurodollar Loan or to convert an ABR Loan into a Eurodollar Loan on the date
scheduled for such borrowing, prepayment or conversion. Each Lender shall
furnish the Company with a reasonably detailed statement explaining the amount
of any such loss or expense, which statement shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

         SECTION 3A. GUARANTY.

                           3A.1.    GUARANTY OF PAYMENT.

         Subject to Section 3A.7 below, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly
and severally, unconditionally guarantees to (a) each Lender, (b) each Affiliate
of a Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement and (c) the Administrative
Agent the prompt payment of the Obligations in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise). This
guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not merely of collection and is a
continuing guaranty and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising.

                           3A.2.    OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder are absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Credit Documents or the Hedging Agreements, or any other
agreement or instrument referred to herein, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or
guarantor. Each Guarantor agrees that this guaranty may be enforced by the
Lenders without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any
security or collateral and without the necessity at any time of having recourse
to the Notes, the Agreement or any other Credit Documents or any

                                       33
<PAGE>
collateral, if any, hereafter securing the Obligations or otherwise and each
Guarantor hereby waives the right to require the Lenders to proceed against the
Company or any other Person (including a co-guarantor) or to require the Lenders
to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right. Each Guarantor further
agrees that it shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or
contribution against the Company or any other guarantor of the Obligations for
amounts paid under this guaranty until such time as the Lenders (and any
Affiliates of Lenders entering into Hedging Agreements) have been paid in full,
all Commitments under this Agreement have been terminated and no Person or
Governmental Authority shall have any right to request any return or
reimbursement of funds from the Lenders in connection with monies received under
this Agreement. Each Guarantor further agrees that nothing contained herein
shall prevent the Lenders from suing on the Notes, this Agreement or any other
Credit Document or any of the Hedging Agreements or foreclosing its security
interest in or Lien on any collateral securing the Obligations or from
exercising any other rights available to it under this Agreement, the other
Credit Documents, or any other instrument of security, if any, and the exercise
of any of the aforesaid rights and the completion of any foreclosure proceedings
shall not constitute a discharge of any of a Guarantor's obligations hereunder;
it being the purpose and intent of each Guarantor that its obligations hereunder
shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under any and all
circumstances. Neither a Guarantor's obligations under this guaranty nor any
remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed or
released in any manner whatsoever by an impairment, modification, change,
release or limitation of the liability of the Company or by reason of the
bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. Each Guarantor waives any and all
notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations
and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
upon this guaranty or acceptance of this guaranty. The Obligations, and any of
them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted, incurred,
renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon this guaranty. All
dealings between the Company and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, likewise shall be
conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this
guaranty.

                           3A.3.    MODIFICATIONS.

         Each Guarantor agrees that (a) all or any part of the security which
hereafter may be held for the Obligations may be exchanged, compromised or
surrendered from time to time; (b) the Lenders shall not have any obligation to
protect, perfect, secure or insure any such security interests, liens or
encumbrances which hereafter may be held for the Obligations or the properties
subject thereto; (c) the time or place of payment of the Obligations may be
changed or extended, in whole or in part, to a time certain or otherwise, and
may be renewed or accelerated, in whole or in part; (d) the Company and any
other party liable for payment under this Agreement may be granted indulgences
generally; (e) any of the provisions of the Notes, this Agreement or any other
Credit Document may be modified, amended or waived; (f) any party (including any
co-guarantor) liable for the payment thereof may be granted indulgences or be
released; and (g) any deposit balance for the credit of the Company or any other
party liable for the payment of the Obligations or liable upon any security
therefor may be released, in whole or in part, at, before or after the stated,
extended or accelerated maturity of the Obligations, all without notice to or
further assent by such Guarantor, which shall remain bound thereon,

                                       34
<PAGE>
notwithstanding any such exchange, compromise, surrender, extension, renewal,
acceleration, modification, indulgence or release.

                           3A.4.    WAIVER OF RIGHTS.

         Each Guarantor expressly waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law: (a) notice of acceptance of this guaranty by the Lenders and of
all extensions of credit to the Company by the Lenders; (b) presentment and
demand for payment or performance of any of the Obligations; (c) protest and
notice of dishonor or of default (except as specifically required in this
Agreement) with respect to the Obligations or with respect to any security
therefor; (d) notice of the Lenders obtaining, amending, substituting for,
releasing, waiving or modifying any security interest, lien or encumbrance, if
any, hereafter securing the Obligations, or the Lenders subordinating,
compromising, discharging or releasing such security interests, liens or
encumbrances; (e) all other notices to which such Guarantor might otherwise be
entitled in connection with the guaranty evidenced by this Section 3A; and (f)
demand for payment under this guaranty.

                           3A.5.    REINSTATEMENT.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 3A shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result
of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each
Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender
on demand for all reasonable, documented costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable, documented fees of counsel) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or
restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against
any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent
transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

                           3A.6.    REMEDIES.

         Each Guarantor agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand,
and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Obligations
may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 6.1 (and
shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the
circumstances provided in Section 6.1) notwithstanding any stay, injunction or
other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing such Obligations
from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and
that, in the event of such declaration (or such Obligations being deemed to have
become automatically due and payable), such Obligations (whether or not due and
payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the
Guarantors. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that the Lenders may exercise
their rights and remedies thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof.

                           3A.7.    LIMITATION OF GUARANTY.

                                       35
<PAGE>
         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, to the
extent the obligations of any Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any
applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers)
then the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum
amount that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state and
including, without limitation, Debtor Relief Laws).

                           3A.8.    RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The Guarantors agree among themselves that, in connection with payments
made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have contribution rights against the other
Guarantors as permitted under applicable law. Such contribution rights shall be
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the obligations of the Guarantors
under the Credit Documents and no Guarantor shall exercise such rights of
contribution until all Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments
terminated.

         SECTION 4. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT.

                           4.1.     EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

                  properly executed by a Responsible Officer of the signing

                           (iv)     such certificates of resolutions or other
                  action, incumbency certificates and/or other certificates of
                  Responsible Officers of each Credit Party as the

                  lease or operation of properties or the conduct of its
                  business requires such qualification, except to the extent
                  that failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to
                  have a Material Adverse Effect.

                           (ii)     in the case of each real property leasehold

                  desirable, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative
                  Agent, so as to enable the Mortgage encumbering such
                  leasehold interest to effectively create a valid and
                  enforceable first priority lien (subject to Permitted Liens)

                  with respect to each Mortgaged Property designated as a
                  material Mortgaged Property on Schedule 1.21(a), assuring
                  the Collateral Agent that the Mortgage on each such material
                  Mortgaged Property creates a valid and enforceable first
                  priority mortgage lien on the applicable Mortgaged Property,
                  free and clear of all defects and encumbrances except for

                  the Administrative Agent may require; without limiting the
                  foregoing, such Mortgage Policies shall be in such amounts
                  as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require (but in
                  no event shall the aggregate amount of such Mortgage
                  Policies be less than $325,000,000); and

                  hazards (a "Flood Hazard Property") and (B) if any Mortgaged
                  Property is a Flood Hazard Property, (1) whether the

                  receipt of written notification from the Collateral Agent
                  (a) as to the fact that such Mortgaged Property is a Flood
                  Hazard Property and (b) as to whether the community in which
                  each such Flood Hazard Property is located is participating
                  in the National Flood Insurance Program and (3) copies of
                  insurance policies or certificates of insurance of the
                  Consolidated Parties evidencing flood insurance satisfactory
                  to the Administrative Agent and naming the Collateral Agent
                  as sole loss payee on behalf of the Lenders.

                  (e)      Evidence of Insurance. Receipt by the Administrative

         limited to, naming the Collateral Agent as additional insured (in the
         case of liability insurance) or loss payee (in the case of hazard
         insurance) on behalf of the Lenders.

         (B) each Credit Party is in compliance with all existing material
         financial obligations, (C) all governmental, shareholder and third
         party consents and approvals, if any, with respect to the Credit

         Administrative Agent following the occurrence of any event or the
         discovery of any condition which the Administrative Agent or the
         Required Lenders reasonably believe has caused (or could be reasonably

         applications, service mark applications, trade name applications and
         copyright applications submitted by any Credit Party since the last

         such application, all in such form as shall be reasonably satisfactory
         to the Administrative Agent.

         Each notice pursuant to this Section 5.1(c)(i)-(v) shall be accompanied
by a statement of a Responsible Officer of the Company setting forth details of
the occurrence referred to therein and stating what action the Company has taken
and proposes to take with respect thereto.

         (d)      PAYMENT OF OBLIGATIONS.

         It will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay, discharge or

case may be, all its material obligations of whatever nature, including (i) all
material tax liabilities, assessments and governmental charges or levies upon it
or its properties or assets; (ii) all lawful material claims which, if unpaid,
would by law become a Lien upon its property; and (iii) all material
Indebtedness, as and when due and payable, but subject to any subordination
provisions contained in any instrument or agreement evidencing such

appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and adequate reserves in accordance
with GAAP are being maintained by the Company or such Subsidiary.

         (e)      CONDUCT OF BUSINESS AND MAINTENANCE OF EXISTENCE.

                                       45
<PAGE>
         It will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) continue to
engage in business of the same general type as now conducted by it and preserve,
renew and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence (except in
connection with mergers, consolidations or dissolutions permitted under Section
5.2(b)) and take all reasonable action to maintain all rights, privileges and
franchises necessary in the normal conduct of its business and (ii) comply with
all Contractual Obligations and Requirements of Law except to the extent that
failure to comply therewith could not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (f)      MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY; INSURANCE.

                  (i)      The Company will, and will cause each of its
         Subsidiaries to, (A) keep all property useful and necessary in its
         business in good working order and condition, except where the failure
         to keep such property in good working order could not reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (B) make all necessary
         repairs thereto and renewals and replacements thereof and (C) use the
         standard of care typical in the industry in the operation and
         maintenance of its facilities, to the extent such standard of care is
         reasonably determinable and taking into account any specific
         circumstances.

                  (ii)     The Company will, and will cause each of its
         Subsidiaries to, maintain with financially sound and reputable
         insurance companies insurance on all its property in at least such
         amount and against at least such risks as are usually insured against
         in the same general area by companies engaged in the same or a similar
         business (to the extent such standards are reasonably determinable and
         taking into account any specific circumstances, it being understood
         that the Company may maintain self-insurance to a similar extent as is
         commonly maintained by companies engaged in the same or a similar
         business). The Collateral Agent shall be named as loss payee or
         mortgagee, as its interest may appear, and/or additional insured with
         respect to any such insurance providing coverage in respect of any
         Collateral, and the Company will, and will cause each of its
         Subsidiaries to, (i) ensure that each provider of any such insurance
         shall agree, by endorsement upon the policy or policies issued by it
         or by independent instruments furnished to the Collateral Agent, that
         it will give the Collateral Agent thirty (30) days prior written
         notice before any such policy or policies shall be altered in any
         material respect or canceled, and (ii) use commercially reasonable
         efforts to ensure that each provider of any such insurance shall
         agree, by endorsement upon the policy or policies issued by it or by
         independent instruments furnished to the Collateral Agent, that it
         will give the Collateral Agent at least thirty (30) days prior written
         notice before any such policy or policies shall be materially altered,
         and, if the provider does not so agree, the Company or such Subsidiary
         agrees that it shall give such notice to the Collateral Agent.

                  (iii)    In the event that any Credit Party or any of its
         Subsidiaries receives Net Cash Proceeds on account of any loss of,
         damage to or destruction of, or any condemnation or other taking for
         public use of, any Property of the Credit Parties or their
         Subsidiaries (with respect to any such Person, an "Involuntary
         Disposition"), the Credit Parties shall apply (or cause to be applied)
         such Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with

                                       46
<PAGE>
         the terms of Section 2.6(b)(iii). All insurance proceeds with respect
         to the Collateral shall be subject to the security interest of the

books and records, its accounts receivable and inventory, its facilities and its
other business assets, and to make photocopies or photographs thereof and to

permit the Administrative Agent or its representatives to investigate and verify
the accuracy of information provided to the Lenders, and to discuss all such
matters with the executive officers, pertinent employees and representatives of
the Credit Parties, all at the expense of the Company, provided that upon each
visit the representatives shall each sign a customary plant visitor agreement
and otherwise comply with all customary and reasonable visitation procedures;
provided, however, that so long as no Event of Default shall have

                                       47

Credit Party and (ii) such visits and inspections shall only occur with
reasonable frequency and shall not disrupt the normal business operations of any
Credit Party. The Administrative Agent agrees to keep confidential the
information obtained from any such audit or inspection in accordance with the

         (l)      ADDITIONAL CREDIT PARTIES.

         At the time any Person becomes a Domestic Subsidiary (other than a
Receivables Financing SPC or a Preferred Stock SPC or as otherwise agreed to by

                           5.2.     NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

         So long as this Agreement, any of the Notes, any LOC Obligations or any
other Credit Document shall remain in effect or any of the principal of or

                  Credit Party or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of a
                  Credit Party or (II) otherwise in a transaction in which the
                  assets of such dissolving Subsidiary become owned by a

                           set forth in Section 5.2(d) as of the most recent
                           fiscal quarter end with respect to which the

                           Property is required to meet the test set forth in
                           the foregoing clause (1), certifying that the
                           quarterly financial statements with respect to the
                           Person or Property acquired for each fiscal quarter

                           to year-end adjustments) and reviewed by independent
                           certified public accountants of recognized national
                           standing reasonably acceptable to the Administrative

                  correct in all material respects at and as if made as of the
                  date of such Acquisition (after giving effect thereto)
                  except to the extent such representations and warranties
                  expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case they
                  shall be true and correct in all material respects as of
                  such earlier date);

                           (F)      Partnership Interests. If such transaction
                  involves the purchase of an interest in a partnership
                  between the Company (or a Subsidiary of the Company) as a
                  general partner and entities unaffiliated with the Company
                  or such Subsidiary as the other partners, such transaction
                  shall be effected by having such equity interest acquired by
                  a corporate holding company directly or indirectly
                  wholly-owned by the Company newly formed for the sole

                  in this Section 5.2(b)(ii) as the "Aggregate Consideration")
                  paid by the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for all
                  such Acquisitions occurring in each fiscal year shall not
                  exceed (a) with respect to Acquisitions of assets and/or
                  Persons located in the United States, $300,000,000 and (b)
                  with respect to all other Acquisitions, $100,000,000;

                  $50,000,000.

                  (iii)    Sale of Assets. It will not, and will not permit any
         of its Subsidiaries to, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any of its
         assets, in a transaction or a series of related transactions unless
         (A) such transaction is not an Asset Disposition, or (B) the aggregate
         value of the assets sold, leased or disposed of in such transaction,
         when added to the aggregate value of all assets sold, leased or
         disposed of in all transactions permitted by this clause (B) at any
         time after the Closing Date, does not exceed $75,000,000; provided,
         however, that at least 85% of the consideration received by the
         Company and/or its Subsidiaries in connection with each such
         transaction shall be in cash or Cash Equivalents.

                  (iv)     Release of Guarantors and Collateral. Upon the sale
         of any Subsidiary (or dissolution thereof, via merger or otherwise) or

         including, without limitation, amendments or terminations of UCC
         financing statements, the release of Mortgages and the release of such
         Subsidiary from all of its obligations under the Credit Documents,
         including the release of such Subsidiary if it is a Guarantor
         hereunder, from its obligations under Section 3A hereof. Upon the
         release of a Guarantor the pledges and grants of security interests to
         the extent given by such Guarantor pursuant to the Security Agreement
         and the Mortgages, and the covenants and other agreements contained
         herein and therein, shall no longer be effective as to such Guarantor
         and shall otherwise cease and be of no further force and effect as to
         such Guarantor.

the end of which it is intended that the use by the Company or its Subsidiary of
such Property will be discontinued.

         Reference is hereby made to the High Yield Note Indenture and the
covenants contained in Article 4 of the High Yield Note Indenture (hereinafter
referred to as the "Incorporated Covenants"). The Credit Parties agree with the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders that the Incorporated Covenants (and all
other relevant provisions of the High Yield Note Indenture, related thereto,
including without limitation the defined terms and other provisions contained in
Article 4 and Section 1.01 thereof which are used in the Incorporated Covenants,
hereinafter referred to as the "Additional Incorporated Terms") are hereby
incorporated by reference into this Agreement to the same extent and with the
same effect as if set forth herein and shall inure to the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, without giving effect to any waiver,
amendment, modification or replacement of the High Yield Note Indenture or any
term or provision of the Incorporated Covenants occurring subsequent to the
Closing Date, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided in the
following provisions of this paragraph. In the event a waiver is granted under
the High Yield Note Indenture or an amendment or modification is executed with
respect to the High Yield Note Indenture, and such waiver, amendment and/or
modification affects the Incorporated Covenants or the Additional Incorporated
Terms, then such waiver, amendment or modification shall be effective with
respect to the Incorporated Covenants and the Additional Incorporated Terms as
incorporated by reference into this Agreement. In the event of any replacement
of the High Yield Note Indenture with a similar indenture (the "New Indenture")
the covenants and additional terms contained in the New Indenture which
correspond to the covenants contained in Article 4, respectively, and such
additional terms contained in Article 4 and Section 1.01 (each of the foregoing
contained in the High Yield Note Indenture) shall become the Incorporated
Covenants and the Additional Incorporated Terms. In the event that the High
Yield Notes are repaid in full and all of the obligations under the High Yield
Note Indenture are terminated and not replaced or otherwise refinanced, the
terms of the Section 5.3 shall no longer apply. For purposes of the
incorporation of the Incorporated Covenants pursuant to this Section 5.3, all
references in the Incorporated Covenants to the "Trustee" shall be deemed to
refer to the Administrative Agent hereunder.

(b)(i) and (c) hereof and such failure referred to in this Section 6.1(b)(ii)
shall continue unremedied for a period of five (5) days after the earlier of a
Responsible Officer of the Company becoming aware of such failure or written
notice specifying such failure and stating that such notice is a "Notice of
Default" hereunder is given, by registered or certified mail or by courier, to
the Company on behalf of the Credit Parties by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender;

         (c)      any Credit Party shall fail to perform or observe (i) any

or securing Indebtedness or any obligations under Hedging Agreements, in each
case with an outstanding principal or notional amount in excess of $25,000,000
for such period of time as would permit, or would have permitted (assuming the
giving of appropriate notice if required) the holder or holders thereof or of
any obligations issued thereunder (or a trustee or agent on behalf of such
holder or holders), to accelerate the maturity thereof, or of any such
obligation; or

         (f)      the Company or any Subsidiary shall (i) apply for or consent

         SECTION 7. DEFINITIONS AND ACCOUNTING TERMS.

                           7.1      DEFINITIONS.

         As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings (and including the plural as well as the singular):

         "ABR": for any day, a rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to
the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the greater of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on
such day and (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2
of 1%. For purposes hereof: "Prime Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per
annum established from time to time by the Administrative Agent as its prime

being intended to be the lowest rate of interest charged by Credit Suisse First

Effective Rate", shall mean, for any day, the weighted average of the rates on
overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System
arranged by federal funds brokers, as published on the next succeeding Business

the day of such transactions received by the Administrative Agent from three
federal funds brokers of recognized standing selected by it. If for any reason
the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that it is unable to ascertain the Federal
Funds Effective Rate for any reason, including the inability or failure of the
Administrative Agent to obtain sufficient quotations in accordance with the
terms thereof, the ABR shall be determined without regard to clause (b) of the
first sentence of this definition until the circumstances giving rise to such
inability no longer exist. Any change in the ABR due to a change in the Prime
Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective as of the opening of
business on the effective day of such change in the Prime Rate or the Federal
Funds Effective Rate, respectively.

         "ABR Loans": Loans the rate of interest applicable to which is based
upon the ABR.

         "Acquisition": by any Person, the acquisition by such Person, in a
single transaction or in a series of related transactions, of all of the Capital
Stock or all or substantially all of the Property of, or business line of,
another Person, whether or not involving a merger or consolidation with such

                                       62
<PAGE>
other Person and whether for cash, property, services, assumption of
Indebtedness, securities or otherwise.

         "Additional Credit Party": each Person that becomes a Guarantor after
the Closing Date, as provided in Section 5.1(l).

         "Administrative Agent": Credit Suisse First Boston, acting through its
Cayman Islands Branch, or any successor.

         "Affiliate": as to any specified Person, any other Person (other than a
Subsidiary) which, directly or indirectly, is in control of, is controlled by,
or is under common control with, such Person. For purposes of this definition,
"control" of a specified Person means the power, directly or indirectly, either
to (a) vote 20% or more of the securities having ordinary voting power for the
election of directors of such Person or (b) direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of such Person whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise.

         "Agents": a collective reference to the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent; "Agent" shall mean either one of them.

         "Agreement": this Agreement, as amended, supplemented, restated or
modified from time to time.

         "Applicable Margin": with respect to (a) Eurodollar Loans that are

liabilities under Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA, over the current value of that

funding the Pension Plan pursuant to Section 412 of the Code for the applicable
plan year.

         All accounting terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in accordance with GAAP.

                           7.2      ACCOUNTING TERMS.

         (a)      Except as otherwise specifically prescribed herein, all
accounting terms not specifically or completely defined herein shall be
construed in conformity with, and all financial data (including financial ratios
and other financial calculations) required to be submitted pursuant to this
Agreement shall be prepared in conformity with, GAAP applied on a consistent
basis, as in effect from time to time, applied in a manner consistent with that
used in preparing the financial statements referred to in Section 1.2(a);
provided, however, that calculations of the attributable amount of Indebtedness
under any Synthetic Lease or similar obligation or the implied interest
component of any Synthetic Lease or similar obligation shall be made by the
Company in accordance with accepted financial practice and consistent with the
terms of such Synthetic Lease or similar obligation.

         (b)      If at any time any change in GAAP would affect the computation
of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Credit Document, and
either the Company or the Required Lenders shall so request, the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders and the Company shall negotiate in good faith to amend such
ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such
change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); provided that,
until so amended, (i) such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in
accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and (ii) the Company shall
provide to the Administrative Agent and

                                       86

the Lenders financial statements and other documents required under this
Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation
between calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after giving
effect to such change in GAAP.

         (c)      Notwithstanding the above, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that, for purposes of all calculations made under the financial covenants
set forth in Section 5.2(d) or otherwise hereunder (including without limitation
for purposes of the definitions of "Applicable Margin" and "Pro Forma Basis" set
forth in Section 7.1), (i) after consummation of any Asset Disposition (A)
income statement items (whether positive or negative) and capital expenditures
attributable to the Property disposed of shall be excluded and (B) Indebtedness
which is retired shall be excluded and deemed to have been retired as of the
first day of the applicable period and (ii) after consummation of any
Acquisition (A) income statement items (whether positive or negative) and
capital expenditures attributable to the Person or Property acquired shall, to
the extent not otherwise included in such income statement items for the Company
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP or in accordance with
any defined terms set forth in Section 7.1(a), be included to the extent
relating to any period applicable in such calculations, (B) to the extent not
retired in connection with such Acquisition, Indebtedness of the Person or
Property acquired shall be deemed to have been incurred as of the first day of
the applicable period and (C) pro forma adjustments may be included to the
extent that such adjustments are satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and
would give effect to items that are (1) directly attributable to such
transaction, (2) expected to have a continuing impact on the Company and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries and (3) factually supportable.

                           7.3      ROUNDING.

         Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Company pursuant
to this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by
the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of
places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or
down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).

                           7.4      REFERENCES TO AGREEMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS OF
                                    LAW.

         Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, (i) references to articles
of incorporation, by-laws, operating agreements or other similar organization
documents, agreements (including the Credit Documents) and other contractual
instruments shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments, restatements,

that such amendments, restatements, extensions, supplements and other
modifications are not prohibited by any Credit Document; and (ii) references to
any Requirement of Law shall include all statutory and regulatory provisions
consolidating, amending, replacing, supplementing or interpreting such
Requirement of Law.

         SECTION 8. THE AGENTS.

                           8.1.     APPOINTMENT.

         Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Credit Suisse
First Boston, acting through its Cayman Islands Branch, as the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes Credit Suisse
First Boston, acting through its Cayman Islands Branch, as the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its
behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and
to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent by the terms of this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Agents shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Credit Document or otherwise exist against the Agents.

                           8.2.     DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         Each of the Agents may execute any of its duties under this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such
duties. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

                           8.3.     EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS.

         No Agent nor any of such Agent's officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action
lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document (except for its or
such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in
any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations
or warranties made by the Company, any other Credit Party or any officer thereof
contained in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received
by such Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or for any
failure of the Company

                                       88
<PAGE>
or any other Credit Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as
to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Credit Parties.

                           8.4.     RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE
                                    COLLATERAL AGENT.

         The Agents shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in
relying, upon any Credit Document, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement,
order or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to the Credit Parties), independent accountants and other
experts selected by the Agents. The Agents may deem and treat the payee of any
Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of
assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the
Administrative Agent. The Agents shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under this Agreement or any other Credit Document unless it
shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agents shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the
Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of
the Notes.

                           8.5.     NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence
of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless such Agent has received
notice from a Lender or the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such
Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default". In the event that an Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative
Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders and the other Agent. The Agents
shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall
be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided that unless and until
an Agent shall have received such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Lenders.

                           8.6.     NON-RELIANCE ON AGENTS AND OTHER LENDERS.

         Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no Agent nor any of such
Agent's officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates
has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by an Agent
hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Credit Parties,
shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by such Agent to
any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender, and based on such
documents and information as

                                       89
<PAGE>
it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and made its own decision to make its
Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.
Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance
upon the Agents or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and to make such investigation as it
deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties. Except
for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to
the Lenders by the Agents hereunder, no Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Credit Parties which may come
into the possession of an Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

                           8.7.     INDEMNIFICATION.

         The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to
the extent not reimbursed by the Company or another Credit Party and without
limiting the obligation of the Company or another Credit Party to do so),
ratably according to their respective Pro Rata Shares in effect on the date on
which indemnification is sought under this subsection (or, if indemnification is
sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the
Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Notes)
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements to the extent resulting from such Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the payment
of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder or under the other Credit
Documents.

                           8.8.     AGENTS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Credit Parties as though
such Agent were not an Agent hereunder and under the other Credit Documents.
With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, the
Agents shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the Notes
as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the
terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include each Agent in its individual
capacity.

                                       90
<PAGE>
                           8.9.     SUCCESSOR AGENT.

         Any Agent may resign as an Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Lenders.
If an Agent shall resign as an Agent under this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, then the Company shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor
agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be approved by the Required
Lenders (provided that if an Event of Default shall then exist, the Required
Lenders shall appoint such successor agent from among the Lenders without need
of the Company's consent or approval), whereupon such successor agent shall
succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term "Administrative Agent" or
"Collateral Agent", as the case may be, shall mean such successor agent
effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Agent's rights,
powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act
or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement
or any of the other Credit Documents or any holders of the Notes. After any
retiring Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this subsection shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Agent under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

                           8.10.    OTHER AGENTS, ARRANGERS AND MANAGERS.

         None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing pages of
this Agreement as a "syndication agent," "documentation agent," "co-agent,"
"book manager," "lead manager," "arranger," "lead arranger," "co-arranger" or
"bookrunner" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility
or duty under this Agreement other than, in the case of such Lenders, those
applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not
relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified
in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action
hereunder.

         SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

                           9.1.     AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.

         Neither this Agreement, any other Credit Document, nor any terms hereof
or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with
the provisions of this subsection. The Required Lenders may, or, with the
written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, from time
to time, (a) enter into with the Credit Parties written amendments, supplements
or modifications hereto and to the other Credit Documents for the purpose of
adding any provisions to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or
changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Credit Parties
hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the
Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may specify in
such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other Credit
Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided,
however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification
shall (i) reduce the amount or extend the scheduled date of maturity (including
(x) in the case of the Term

                                       91
<PAGE>
B Loan, any scheduled amortization payment required pursuant to Section 2.15(d)
and (y) in the case of the Incremental Term Loan, any scheduled amortization
payment required pursuant to Section 2.16(d), if any) of any Loan, or reduce the
stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder or thereunder or extend the
scheduled date of any payment thereof (excluding mandatory prepayments) or
increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender's Commitment, in
each case without the consent of each Lender affected thereby, or (ii) amend,
modify or waive any provision of this subsection or reduce the percentage
specified in the definition of Required Lenders or consent to the assignment or
transfer by a Credit Party of any of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the Notes or, except as the result of or in connection with an
Asset Disposition permitted by Section 5.2(b), release all or substantially all
of the Collateral or, except as the result of or in connection with a
consolidation, merger or disposition of a Credit Party permitted under Section
5.2(b), release the Company or all or substantially all of the Guarantors from
its or their obligations under the Credit Documents, amend, modify or waive any
provision of Section 2.11 or this Section 9.1, in each case without the written
consent of all the Lenders, (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of
Section 8 without the written consent of the then Administrative Agent. Any such
waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to
each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Credit Parties, the Lenders,
the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Notes, (iv) amend, modify
or waive any provision of Section 2.14 without the written consent of the
Issuing Lender or (v) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.13
without the written consent of the Swingline Lender. In the case of any waiver,
the Credit Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored
to their former position and rights hereunder and under the outstanding Notes,
and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default
or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

         Without limiting the requirements set forth in this Section 9.1,
neither (A) the time for or the amount or the manner of application of proceeds
of any mandatory prepayment required by Section 2.6(b)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v)
hereof, nor (B) any provision providing for the allocation of any payments to
the Term Loans, nor (C) any other amendment, modification, termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement that has the effect of disproportionately
disadvantaging any one Class (as defined below) relative to any other Class
shall be effective without the written concurrence of Requisite Class Lenders
(as defined below) of each affected Class (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any such provision which
only postpones or reduces any voluntary or mandatory prepayment, or Commitment
reduction from those set forth in Section 2.6 with respect to one Class but not
any other Class shall be deemed to disproportionately disadvantage such one
Class but not to affect or disproportionately disadvantage any such other
Class). For purposes hereof, "Class" shall mean, as applied to Lenders, each of
the following three classes of Lenders: (i) Lenders holding a Term B Loan
Commitment or portion of the Term B Loan, (ii) Lenders holding an Incremental
Term Loan Commitment or a portion of the Incremental Term Loan, and (iii)
Lenders holding a Revolving Commitment or any extension of credit with respect
thereto, and "Requisite Class Lenders" shall mean Lenders of such Class holding
in the aggregate (i) in the case of the Term B Loan, at least a majority of the
Term B Loan outstanding, (ii) in the case of the Incremental Term Loan, at least
a majority portion of the Incremental Term Loan, and (iii) in the

                                       92
<PAGE>
case of Revolving Loans, at least a majority of the Revolving Loans outstanding
or at least a majority portion of the Revolving Committed Amount.

provided that any notice, request or demand to or upon the Administrative Agent
or the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.11, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 or
3A.9 shall not be effective until received.

         Documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.1(a), Section
5.1(b)(vi) and Section 5.1(c) may be delivered electronically and if so
delivered, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date on which such
documents are posted on the Company's behalf on IntraLinks/IntraAgency or
another relevant website, if any, to which each Lender and the Administrative
Agent have access (whether a commercial, third-party website or whether
sponsored by the Administrative Agent); provided that: (i) the Company shall
deliver paper copies of such documents to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
that requests the Company to deliver such paper copies until a written request
to cease delivering paper copies is given by the Administrative Agent or such
Lender and (ii) the Company shall notify (which may be by facsimile or
electronic mail) the Administrative Agent and each Lender of the posting of any
such documents and provide to the Administrative Agent by electronic mail
electronic versions (i.e., soft copies) of such documents. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein, in every instance the Company shall be required to
provide paper copies of the officer's compliance certificate required by Section
5.1(b)(i) to the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders. Except for such
Compliance Certificates, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to
request the delivery or to maintain copies of the documents referred to above,
and in any event shall have no responsibility to monitor compliance by the
Company with any such request for delivery, and each Lender shall be solely
responsible for requesting delivery to it or maintaining its copies of such
documents.

                           9.3.     NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.

         No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, any Lender or any Credit Party,
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the Notes shall operate
as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

                           9.4.     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         All representations and warranties made hereunder, in the Notes and in

                           9.5.     PAYMENT OF EXPENSES AND TAXES.

         The Company agrees (a) to pay or reimburse each Agent for all its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
development, preparation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or
modification to, this Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents and
any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the
consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel to each Agent, (b) to pay or reimburse each Lender and each Agent for
all its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement, attempted enforcement or preservation of any rights under this
Agreement, the Notes, any other Credit Document and any such other documents
related thereto (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any
"workout" or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal
proceeding, including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to each
Agent and counsel to the several Lenders (including, without duplication, the
allocated costs of in-house counsel to any Lender), (c) to pay, indemnify, and
hold each Lender and each Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing
fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in
paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, which may be payable or
determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or
consummation or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or
any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or
in respect of, this Agreement, the Notes and any such other documents, and (d)
to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender, each Agent and each of their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and
attorneys-in-fact (each, an "indemnified person") harmless from and against any
and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and
administration of this Agreement, the Notes, the LOC Documents and the other
Credit Documents, the use of proceeds of the Loans and Letters of Credit and any
such other documents, including, without limitation, any of the foregoing
relating to the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any
environmental or other law applicable to the operations of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of the its respective properties (all the foregoing in
this clause (d), collectively, the "indemnified liabilities"); provided that the
Company shall have no obligation hereunder to any Agent or any Lender with
respect to indemnified liabilities which have been finally determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of such indemnified person. The agreements in this subsection
shall survive repayment of the Loans, the LOC Obligations and all other amounts
payable hereunder or under the other Credit Documents.

                           9.6.     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS AND
                                    ASSIGNMENTS.

         (a)      This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Credit Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, all future holders of the Loans and their respective successors and
assigns, except that no Credit Party may assign or

                                       95
<PAGE>
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of each Lender.

         (b)      Any Lender may, without notice to or consent of the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more
banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any Loan
owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such
Lender, any Participation Interest of such Lender or any other interest of such
Lender hereunder, under the Notes or under any other Credit Document. In the
event of any such sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant,
such Lender's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible
for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such
Note for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and
the Credit Parties and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the Notes. The Credit Parties agree that if
amounts outstanding under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Credit Document
are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and
payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be
deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in
amounts owing under this Agreement, any Note or any other Credit Document to the
same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly
to it as a Lender under this Agreement, any Note or any other Credit Document,
provided that, in purchasing such participating interest, such Participant shall
be deemed to have agreed to share with the Lenders the proceeds thereof as
provided in Section 9.7(a) as fully as if it were a Lender hereunder.

         (c)      Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for
purposes of this subsection (b), participations in Swingline Loans and LOC
Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of
an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment
to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in
subsection (h) of this Section) of any Lender, the aggregate amount of the
Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder)
subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative
Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of
the Trade Date, shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) any assignment of a Revolving Commitment
must be approved by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (whether or not the
proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iii)
the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation
fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee
thereunder shall be a party to this

                                       96
<PAGE>
Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.12, 3.3, 3.5, and 9.5 with respect to facts and
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon
request, the Company (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the
assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

         (d)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 9.2 a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to
it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Credit Parties, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

         (e)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption executed by
an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee (and, in the case of an Eligible
Assignee that is not then a Lender or an affiliate thereof, by the Company and
the Administrative Agent), together with payment by the assigning Lender to the
Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500, the
Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Assumption
and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the
information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance
and recordation to the Lenders and the Company on behalf of the Company.

         (f)      Each Credit Party authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
Participant or Eligible Assignee (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession
concerning such Credit Party and its affiliates which has been delivered to such
Lender by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or which has
been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Company in connection with
such Lender's credit evaluation of the Company and its affiliates prior to
becoming a party to this Agreement.

         (g)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

         (h)      As used herein, the following terms have the following
meanings:

                  "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a
         Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a
         natural person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent (and in the
         case of assignments of Revolving Credit Commitments) the Issuing
         Lender, and (ii) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, the Company (each such approval not to be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing,
         "Eligible Assignee" shall not include the Company or any of the
         Company's Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

                  "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is
         (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise
         investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the
         ordinary course of its business.

                  "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed
         by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an
         Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

         (i)      NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, ANY
LENDER (A "GRANTING LENDER") MAY GRANT TO A SPECIAL PURPOSE FUNDING VEHICLE
IDENTIFIED AS SUCH IN WRITING FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE GRANTING LENDER TO THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COMPANY (AN "SPC") THE OPTION TO PROVIDE ALL OR ANY
PART OF ANY LOAN THAT SUCH GRANTING LENDER WOULD OTHERWISE BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT; PROVIDED THAT (i) NOTHING HEREIN SHALL CONSTITUTE A
COMMITMENT BY ANY SPC TO FUND ANY LOAN, AND (ii) IF AN SPC ELECTS NOT TO
EXERCISE SUCH OPTION OR OTHERWISE FAILS TO MAKE ALL OR ANY PART OF SUCH LOAN,
THE GRANTING LENDER SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE SUCH LOAN PURSUANT TO THE TERMS
HEREOF. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY AGREES THAT (i) NEITHER THE GRANT TO ANY SPC
NOR THE EXERCISE BY ANY SPC OF SUCH OPTION SHALL INCREASE THE COSTS OR EXPENSES
OR OTHERWISE INCREASE OR CHANGE THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 3.3), (ii) NO SPC SHALL BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INDEMNITY OR SIMILAR PAYMENT OBLIGATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR
WHICH A LENDER WOULD BE LIABLE, AND (iii) THE GRANTING LENDER SHALL FOR ALL
PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE APPROVAL OF ANY AMENDMENT, WAIVER OR OTHER MODIFICATION
OF ANY PROVISION OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, REMAIN THE LENDER OF RECORD HEREUNDER.
THE MAKING OF A LOAN BY AN SPC HEREUNDER SHALL UTILIZE THE COMMITMENT OF THE
GRANTING LENDER TO THE SAME EXTENT, AND AS IF, SUCH LOAN WERE MADE BY SUCH
GRANTING LENDER. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
AGREES (WHICH AGREEMENT SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT) THAT,
PRIOR TO THE DATE THAT IS ONE YEAR AND ONE DAY AFTER THE PAYMENT IN FULL OF ALL
OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER SENIOR DEBT OF ANY SPC, IT WILL NOT
INSTITUTE AGAINST, OR JOIN ANY OTHER PERSON IN INSTITUTING AGAINST, SUCH SPC ANY
BANKRUPTCY, REORGANIZATION, ARRANGEMENT, INSOLVENCY, OR LIQUIDATION PROCEEDING
UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE THEREOF. NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, ANY SPC MAY (i) WITH NOTICE TO, BUT
WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENT OF THE COMPANY AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND WITHOUT
PAYING ANY PROCESSING FEE THEREFOR, ASSIGN ALL OR ANY PORTION OF ITS RIGHT TO
RECEIVE PAYMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOAN TO THE GRANTING LENDER AND (ii)
DISCLOSE ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS

                                       98
<PAGE>
ANY NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION RELATING TO ITS FUNDING OF LOANS TO ANY RATING
AGENCY, COMMERCIAL PAPER DEALER OR PROVIDER OF ANY SURETY OR GUARANTEE OR CREDIT
OR LIQUIDITY ENHANCEMENT TO SUCH SPC.

         (j)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of
the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for
holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for
such obligations or securities, provided that unless and until such trustee
actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this
Section 9.6, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of
its obligations under the Credit Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Credit Documents
even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the
pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

                           9.7.     ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF.

         (a)      If any Lender (a "benefited Lender") shall at any time receive
any payment of all or part of its Loans or Participation Interests, or interest
thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Sections 6(f) or (g), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than
any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in
respect of such other Lender's Loans or Participation Interests, or interest
thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a
participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or
shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or
the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited Lender to
share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with
each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender,
such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned,
to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

         (b)      In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided
by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to any Credit
Party, any such notice being expressly waived by each Credit Party to the extent
permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by such
Credit Party hereunder, under the Notes or under any other Credit Document
(whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and
appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other
credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or
indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or
owing by such Lender or any affiliate, branch or agency thereof to or for the
credit or the account of such Credit Party. Each Lender agrees promptly to
notify the Company on behalf of the respective Credit Party and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender,
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
such set-off and application.

                           9.8.     COUNTERPARTS.

                                       99

Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by telecopy), and

parties shall be lodged with the Company and the Administrative Agent.

                           9.9.     ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN GAAP.

         In the event that a change in GAAP affects the terms of the covenants
contained in Section 5.2(d) hereof (including the related defined terms used
therein), the Company and the Required Lenders shall comply with the terms of
Section 7.2(b) and, if applicable, negotiate in good faith such amendments to
such covenant and related definitions as are necessary to reflect such changes
in GAAP and as are otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the
Required Lenders.

                           9.10.    SEVERABILITY; SECTION HEADINGS.

         (a)      Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.
