<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>THIS EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT </B>is executed this 24<SUP>th</SUP> day of November,

with its principal offices in Bala Cynwyd, PA (the &#147;Company&#148;) and Timothy J.

&#147;Executive&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the parties hereto desire that the Executive be employed by the
Company upon the terms and conditions provided for herein; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, in connection with such employment, the parties desire to provide
the Executive with the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the
Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW</B>, <B>THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of
which is mutually acknowledged, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>TERM OF EMPLOYMENT; RENEWAL. </B>The Company agrees to employ the Executive
and the Executive accepts employment with the Company for the period commencing
as of the date hereof (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) and ending on December&nbsp;31, 2008
(such initial period, as extended below, shall be referred to as the
&#147;Employment Term&#148;). The term of this Agreement will automatically renew at the
expiration of the then current term for an additional one-year period unless,
at least ninety (90)&nbsp;days prior to the expiration date of the then current
term, either party shall give written notice of nonrenewal to the other, in
which event this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the term then in
effect. If the Company elects not to renew this Agreement at the expiration of
the initial five year term (the &#147;Non-Renewal Date&#148;), and if at such time (i)
there is no other event that would otherwise constitute &#147;Cause&#148; for the
termination of the Executive&#146;s employment hereunder, (ii)&nbsp;the Executive
continues to comply with all his post-termination obligations, and (iii)
executes a general release in form satisfactory to the Company, the Company
shall continue to pay to the Executive his full Annual Direct Salary from the
Non-Renewal Date in equal monthly installments until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the
Executive secures full time employment or (ii)&nbsp;six months from the Non-Renewal
Date. Following the Non-Renewal Date, the Executive shall notify the Company in
writing upon his commencement of any full time employment.

President &#150; Operations of the Company, reporting to the President and Chief
Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) of the Company and shall have such authority and
duties, consistent with such position, as may from time to time be specified by
the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) or CEO. At the request of
the Board, the Executive shall also serve, without additional compensation, as
an officer or director of any Affiliates of the Company that are involved in
the business of insurance, underwriting, reinsurance or other matters related
to the business operation of the Company. For purposes hereof, an &#147;Affiliate&#148;
means any company that is controlled by, under common control with, or that
controls the Company.

time, energies and talents to the business of the Company and shall comply with

interests policies and code of

hereunder.

established for each of the Company&#146;s fiscal years, and shall not be paid until
completion of the Company&#146;s financial statements relating to the performance
period at issue and satisfaction of any other conditions adopted as part of
such programs. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Company from modifying or
amending any such incentive awards plan from time to time, or from terminating
any such plan. The initial bonus program during the first fiscal year for
which the Executive is employed hereunder shall be determined by the Company
subject to approval by the Board.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">this Section will result in irreparable injury to the Company and/or its
Affiliates for which there is no adequate remedy at law and the Company and its
Affiliates shall, in addition to any other remedies available to them, be
entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance in order to enforce the
provisions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Executive
is required to disclose any such confidential or proprietary information
pursuant to applicable law or a subpoena or court order, the Executive shall
promptly notify the Company in writing of any such requirement so that the
Company or the appropriate affiliate may seek an appropriate protective order
or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions hereof.
The Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to obtain such a
protective order or other remedy. If such order or other remedy is not
obtained prior to the time the Executive is required to make the disclosure, or
the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the Executive shall
disclose only that portion of the confidential or proprietary information which
he is advised by counsel that he is legally required to so disclose. All
records, files, memoranda, reports, customer lists, drawings, plans, documents
and the like that the Executive uses, prepares or comes into contact with
during the course of the Executive&#146;s employment shall remain the sole property
of the Company and/or its Affiliates, as applicable. The Executive shall
execute and deliver the Company&#146;s standard &#147;work for hire&#148; agreement regarding

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that
the insurance business and operations of the Company are national in scope, and
that the Company operates in multiple locations and business segments in the
course of conducting its business. In consideration of this Agreement and the
equity interests being made available to the Executive hereunder, the Executive
covenants and agrees that during his employment with the Company, and for a
period of eighteen (18)&nbsp;months following the termination of such employment for
any reason (whether termination occurs during, upon expiration of, or following
the original or the renewal term hereof), including without limitation as a
result of his discharge by the Company with or without Cause or Executive&#146;s
voluntary resignation, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly compete
with the business of the Company or its Affiliates by becoming a shareholder,
officer, agent, employee, partner or director of any other corporation,
partnership or other entity, or otherwise render services to or assist or hold
an interest (except as less than a one percent (1%) shareholder of a publicly
traded company), in any &#147;Competitive Business&#148; (as defined below). &#147;Competitive
Business&#148; shall mean any person or entity (including any joint venture,
partnership, firm, corporation, or limited liability company) that engages in
(1)&nbsp;the specialty property and casualty insurance business, including excess
and surplus lines, non-admitted insurance lines, program-style insurance lines
and/or reinsurance, (2)&nbsp;the insurance agency or brokerage business, (3)
employing, contracting or consulting with any managing general agent or
producer of the Company and (4)&nbsp;any other material business of the Company or
any of its Affiliates as of the date of termination of the Executive&#146;s
employment. In the event that this paragraph shall be determined by any court
of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable in part by reason of its being
too great a period of time or covering too great a geographical area, it shall
be in full force and in effect as to that period of time or geographical area
determined to be reasonable by the court. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein (A)&nbsp;other than in the case of a termination of the
Executive&#146;s employment for Cause hereunder, upon termination of the Executive&#146;s
employment by the Company without Cause or as a result of his disability, the

obligations to make payments under Section&nbsp;9 of this Agreement, and upon
compliance by the Executive with the foregoing obligations, the Executive shall
no longer be subject to the restrictions set forth in subclauses (1)&nbsp;and (2)&nbsp;of
this Section&nbsp;7(a), and (B)&nbsp;in the event of termination by the Company of the
Executive&#146;s employment due to disability, the Executive may elect in writing to
no longer be subject to the restrictions in (1)&nbsp;and (2)&nbsp;of this Section 7(a)

employment with the Company be terminated for any reason (whether such
termination occurs during, upon expiration of, or following the original or the

by the Company with or without Cause or Executive&#146;s voluntary resignation, for
a period of eighteen (18)&nbsp;months following such termination the Executive shall
not: (i)&nbsp;contact, recruit, employ, entice, induce or solicit, directly or
indirectly, any employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent
contractor employed by or performing services for the Company or any of its
Affiliates to leave the employ of or terminate services to the Company or such
Affiliate, including without limitation working with the Executive, with the
entity with which the Executive has affiliated (as an employee, consultant,
officer, director, stockholder or otherwise), or with any other entity; (ii)
seek, either in his individual capacity or on behalf of any other entity,
whether directly or indirectly to solicit, communicate with or contact or
advise, or transact or otherwise engage in any insurance related business with
(x)&nbsp;any party who is or was a customer of the Company or any of its Affiliates
during Executive&#146;s employment by the Company or at any time during the said
eighteen (18)&nbsp;month period, or (y)&nbsp;any party who was identified as a prospect
of the Company or any of its Affiliates during Executive&#146;s employment by the
Company; or (iii)&nbsp;engage in or participate in any effort or act to induce any
customer (as defined in subsection 7(c)(ii)) of the Company or any of its
Affiliates to take any action which might be disadvantageous to the Company or
its Affiliates. The Executive agrees that any breach of the restrictions set
forth in Sections&nbsp;6 and 7 will result in irreparable injury to the Company for
which it shall have no adequate remedy in law and the Company shall, in
addition to any other remedy available to it and in lieu of Section&nbsp;15 hereof,
be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance in order to enforce
the provisions hereof. In addition to its other remedies, the Company shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the Executive and/or the Executive&#146;s employer of
costs incurred in securing a qualified replacement as a result of any breach by
the Executive of this Section. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;customer&#148;
shall include, without limitation, any policyholder, managing general agent or

7, the Company and its Affiliates shall be released from their obligation to
make payments under Section&nbsp;9 of this Agreement and (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) to provide benefits or make payments under all employee benefit
plans in which Executive participates, and the Company shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Executive of severance payments made to the Executive by
the Company following termination of employment with the Company. In addition,
in the event of a violation by the Executive of his covenants in this Section

7: (i)&nbsp;are reasonable in light of all of the circumstances; (ii)&nbsp;are
sufficiently limited to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and its
subsidiaries; (iii)&nbsp;impose no undue hardship on the Executive; and (iv)&nbsp;are not
injurious to the public. The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that
(x)&nbsp;the Executive breach of the provisions of Section&nbsp;7 will cause the Company
irreparable harm, which cannot be adequately compensated by money damages, and
(y)&nbsp;if the Company elects to prevent the Executive from breaching such
provisions by obtaining an injunction against the Executive, there is a
reasonable probability of the Company&#146;s eventual success on the merits. The
Executive consents and agrees that if the Executive commits any such breach or
threatens to comment any breach, the Company shall be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, without
posting any bond or other security and without the necessity of proof of actual
damage, in addition to, and not in lieu of, such other remedies as may be
available to the Company for such breach, including the recovery of money
damages.
