investor and other reasonable costs, fees and damages incurred by Lender in connection with its
failure to fulfill the MBS Commitment or Fannie Mae Commitment. Lender reserves the right to

determinations made as of the Initial Closing Date shall remain unchanged

if only Fixed Loans are Outstanding, once each Calendar Year, within twenty
(20)&nbsp;Business Days after Borrower has delivered to Lender the reports
required in <U>Section&nbsp;8.03</U>, Lender shall determine the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage
Ratio, the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio, the Valuations and the Allocable
Loan Amounts and whether Borrower is in compliance with the other covenants
set forth in the Loan Documents. After the First Anniversary, on an annual
basis, and if Lender decides that changed market or property conditions
warrant, Lender shall redetermine Allocable Loan Amounts and Valuations.
Lender shall also redetermine Allocable Loan Amounts to take account of any
substitution or release of Collateral or a conversion of interest rate or
other event that invalidates the outstanding determinations. In determining
Valuations, Lender shall use Capitalization Rates based on its internal
survey and analysis of capitalization rates for comparable sales in the
vicinity of the Mortgaged Property, with such adjustments as Lender deems
appropriate and without any obligation to use any information provided by
Borrower. If Lender is unable to determine a Capitalization Rate for a
Mortgaged Property, Lender shall have the right,
with the prior consent of Borrower, not more than once annually, to
obtain, at Borrower&#146;s expense, a market study in order to establish a
Capitalization Rate. In the event Borrower fails to consent to Lender
obtaining a market study, Lender shall determine the Capitalization Rate
pursuant to the Underwriting Requirements. Lender shall promptly disclose
its determinations to Borrower. Until redetermined, the outstanding
Allocable Loan Amounts and Valuations shall remain in effect.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no change in
Allocable Loan Amounts, Valuations, the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio or the
Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall, unless resulting from the
concurrent release or substitution of Collateral from the Collateral Pool or
the concurrent conversion of the interest rate, result in a Potential Event
of Default or Event of Default, require the prepayment of any Note in whole
or in part, or require the addition of Collateral to the Collateral Pool.

product if the Supplemental Loan product is offered by Fannie Mae at the time. Any such
Supplemental Loan is subject to Lender&#146;s determination that, as a result of its annual valuation of
the Collateral Pool, a Supplemental Loan may be made pursuant to Lender&#146;s Underwriting Requirements
for Loans which meet the Coverage and LTV Tests. The Supplemental Loan will be documented with
loan documents similar to the Loan Documents (&#147;<U><B>Supplemental Loan Documents</B></U>&#148;). Supplemental
Loans will not be loans advanced under this Agreement. Any Supplemental Loan will be priced at
market at the time of the loan and will be cross-defaulted with the Term Loan. To secure the
obligations of Borrower under the Supplemental Loan Documents, Borrower shall grant, convey and
assign to Lender a second Lien on each Mortgaged Property in the Collateral Pool and on any other
collateral pledged to Lender from time to time pursuant to the Supplemental Loan Documents. On the

Loan to Value Ratio and a higher Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio): (1)
the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to Value
Ratio immediately prior to the release or (2)&nbsp;the Coverage and LTV Test. In
addition to the Release Price, Borrower shall pay to Lender all associated
prepayment premiums and other amounts due under the Notes being repaid. In
connection with a non-simultaneous substitution of Collateral pursuant to

extension of credit or the grant of any lien under Section&nbsp;364 of the
Bankruptcy Code; (xiii)&nbsp;any use of cash collateral under Section&nbsp;363 of the
Bankruptcy Code; or (xiv)&nbsp;any agreement or stipulation with respect to the
provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy proceeding of any person.
The Waiving Borrower further waives any and all rights and defenses that it
may have because the Other Borrower Secured Obligation is secured by real
property; this means, among other things, that: (A)&nbsp;Lender may collect from
the Waiving Borrower without first foreclosing on any real or personal
property collateral pledged by the other Borrower; (B)&nbsp;if Lender forecloses
on any real property collateral pledged by the other Borrower, then (1)&nbsp;the
amount of the Other Borrower Secured Obligation may be reduced only by the
price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the
collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2)&nbsp;Lender may foreclose on
the real property encumbered by the Security Instrument executed by the
Waiving Borrower and securing the Other Borrower Secured Obligation even if
Lender, by foreclosing on the real property collateral of the Other Borrower,
has destroyed any right the Waiving Borrower may have to collect from the
Other Borrower. Subject to the last sentence of Section&nbsp;14.04, the foregoing
sentence is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and
defenses the Waiving Borrower may have because the Other Borrower Secured
Obligation is secured by real property. These rights and defenses being
waived by the Waiving Borrower include, but are not limited to, any rights or
defenses based upon Section&nbsp;580a, 580b, 580d or 726 of the California Code of
Civil Procedure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any
other provision hereof, the Waiving Borrower further expressly waives, except
as provided in Section&nbsp;14.05(g) below, to the extent permitted by law any and
all rights and defenses that might
otherwise be available to it under California Civil Code Sections&nbsp;2787
to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433, or under California Code of Civil
Procedure Sections&nbsp;580a, 580b, 580d and 726, or any of such sections.

under California Civil Code Section&nbsp;2810 and agrees that by doing so the
Security Instrument executed by the Waiving Borrower and securing the Other
Borrower Secured Obligation shall be and remain in full force and effect even
if the other Borrower had no liability at the time of incurring the Other
Borrower Secured Obligation, or thereafter ceases to be liable. The Waiving
Borrower hereby waives any and all benefits and defenses under California
Civil Code Section&nbsp;2809 and agrees that by doing so the Waiving Borrower&#146;s
liability may be larger in amount and more burdensome than that of the other
Borrower. The Waiving Borrower hereby waives the benefit of all principles
or provisions of law that are or might be in conflict with the terms of any
of its waivers, and agrees that the Waiving Borrower&#146;s waivers shall not be
affected by any circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge of a surety or a guarantor. The Waiving Borrower hereby
waives the benefits of any right of discharge and all other rights under any
and all statutes or other laws relating to guarantors or sureties, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, diligence in collecting the Other Borrower
Secured Obligation, presentment, demand for payment, protest, all notices
with respect to the Other Borrower Secured Obligation that may be required by
statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve Lender&#146;s rights against the
Waiving Borrower hereunder, including notice of acceptance, notice of any
amendment of the Loan Documents evidencing the Other Borrower Secured
Obligation, notice of the occurrence of any default or Event of Default,
notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notice of dishonor,
notice of foreclosure, notice of protest, notice of the incurring by the
other Borrower of any obligation or indebtedness and all rights to require
Lender to (i)&nbsp;proceed against the other Borrower, (ii)&nbsp;proceed against any
general partner of the other Borrower, (iii)&nbsp;proceed against or exhaust any
collateral held by Lender to secure the Other Borrower Secured Obligation, or
(iv)&nbsp;if the other Borrower is a partnership, pursue any other remedy it may
have against the other Borrower, or any general partner of the other
Borrower, including any and all benefits under California Civil Code Sections
2845, 2849 and 2850.

certain rights and remedies contained in a Security Instrument executed by
the Other Borrower (such as a nonjudicial foreclosure sale) may affect or
eliminate the Waiving Borrower&#146;s right of subrogation against the Other
Borrower and that the Waiving Borrower may therefore incur a partially or
totally nonreimburseable liability. Nevertheless, the Waiving Borrower
hereby authorizes and empowers Lender to exercise, in
its sole and absolute discretion, any right or remedy, or any
combination thereof, that may then be available, since it is the intent and
purpose of the Waiving Borrower that its waivers shall be absolute,
independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances.

Other Borrower Secured Obligation) destroys or otherwise impairs the

the interest rates in effect from time to time for the Term Loan unless collection from Borrower of
interest at such rate would be contrary to Applicable Law, in which event such amounts shall bear
interest at the highest rate which may be collected from Borrower under Applicable Law. The
