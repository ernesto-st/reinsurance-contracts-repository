                       2. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES.

         2.1.  COMMITMENT TO LEND.

                  2.1.1. DOMESTIC REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Credit Agreement, each of the Domestic Lenders
severally agrees to lend to the Domestic Borrowers and the Domestic Borrowers
may borrow, repay, and reborrow on a joint and several basis from time to time
from the Closing Date up to and including the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity
Date, upon notice by the Domestic Borrowers to the Agent given in accordance
with Section 2.6, such sums as are requested by the Domestic Borrowers up to a
maximum aggregate amount Outstanding (after giving effect to all amounts
requested) at any one time equal to such Domestic Lender's Revolving Credit
Commitment, minus such Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage
of the sum of the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations provided that the Outstanding amount of the Domestic Revolving
Credit Loans (after giving effect to all amounts requested), plus the Maximum
Drawing Amount, plus all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations shall not at any time
exceed the Total Domestic Revolving Commitment, as such amount may be adjusted
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.3 hereof. The Domestic Revolving Credit
Loans shall be made pro rata in accordance with each Domestic Lender's Domestic
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage.

                  2.1.2. CANADIAN LOANS. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Credit Agreement and upon the request of the Canadian Borrower,
each of the Canadian Lenders severally agrees to lend to the Canadian Borrower
in Canadian Dollars, and the Canadian Borrower may borrow, repay, and reborrow
from time to time between the Closing Date and the Revolving Credit Loan
Maturity Date, upon notice by the Canadian Borrower to the Agent given in
accordance with Section 2.6.2, its Canadian Commitment Percentage of the
Canadian Loans as are requested by the Canadian Borrower; provided that the U.S.
Dollar Equivalent of the sum of the outstanding

<PAGE>
                                      -25-



principal amount of the Canadian Loans shall not exceed the Total Canadian
Commitment as such amount may be reduced pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof.

                  2.1.3. GENERAL CONDITIONS. Each request for a Revolving Credit
Loan hereunder shall constitute a representation and warranty by the applicable
Borrowers that the conditions set forth in Section 12 and Section 13, in the
case of the initial Revolving Credit Loans to be made on the Closing Date, and
Section 13, in the case of all other Revolving Credit Loans have been satisfied
on the date of such request.

         2.2.  COMMITMENT FEE.

                  2.2.1. DOMESTIC COMMITMENT FEE. The Domestic Borrowers jointly
and severally agree to pay to the Agent for the accounts of the Domestic Lenders
in accordance with their respective Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentages a commitment fee (such fee, a "Domestic Commitment Fee") calculated
at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for the Commitment Fee on
the average daily amount during each calendar quarter or portion thereof from
the Closing Date to the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date by which the Total
Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment exceeds the sum of (a) the Outstanding
amount of Domestic Revolving Credit Loans plus (b) the Maximum Drawing Amount,
plus (c) all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations during such calendar quarter.

                  2.2.2. CANADIAN COMMITMENT FEE. The Canadian Borrower agrees
to pay to the Canadian Lenders in accordance with their respective Canadian
Commitment Percentages a commitment fee (such fee, a "Canadian Commitment Fee")
calculated at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for the
Commitment Fee on the average daily amount during each calendar quarter or
portion thereof from the Closing Date to the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date
by which the Total Canadian Commitment exceeds the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the
Outstanding amount of Canadian Loans.

                  2.2.3. PAYMENT TERMS. The Commitment Fees shall be payable
quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter for the calendar
quarter then ending, commencing on the first such date after the Closing Date,
with a final payment on the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date or any earlier
date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments shall terminate.

         2.3.  ADJUSTMENTS OF TOTAL REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENT.

                  2.3.1. OPTIONAL REDUCTION OF TOTAL REVOLVING CREDIT
COMMITMENT. Subject to Section 6.9, the Borrowers shall have the right at any
time and from time to time upon three (3) Business Days prior written notice
(confirmed telephonically on the date of delivery of such written notice) or
telephonic notice (confirmed in writing on the date of such telephonic notice)
to the Agent to reduce by $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in
excess thereof, or, terminate entirely, the Total Domestic Revolving Credit
Commitment and/or the Total Canadian Commitment, whereupon, subject to Section
2.3.2 hereof, the Domestic Revolving Credit Commitments of the Domestic Lenders
and/or the Canadian Commitments of the Canadian Lenders, as applicable, shall be
reduced pro rata in accordance with their respective Domestic Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentages or Canadian Commitment Percentage, as the case may be, of
the amount specified in such notice or, as the case may be, terminated. At no
time may (i) the Total Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment be reduced to an
amount less than the sum of (A) the Maximum Drawing Amount of all Letters of
Credit, (B) all Domestic Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding, and (C) all
Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations, or (ii) the Total Canadian Commitment be
reduced to an amount less than the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of all Canadian Loans
then Outstanding. Promptly after receiving

<PAGE>
                                      -26-



any notice of the Borrowers delivered pursuant to this Section 2.3.1, the Agent
will notify the relevant Lenders of the substance thereof. Upon the effective
date of any such reduction or termination, the applicable Borrowers shall pay to
the Agent for the respective accounts of the relevant Lenders, in accordance
with their applicable Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages, the full amount
of any Commitment Fee then accrued on the amount of the reduction. Subject to
Section 2.3.2 hereof, no reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit
Commitments may be reinstated.

                  2.3.2. INCREASE IN TOTAL DOMESTIC REVOLVING COMMITMENT UPON
REDUCTION OF CANADIAN COMMITMENT. Upon (i) an optional reduction of the Total
Canadian Commitment under Section 2.3.1 or (ii) a mandatory reduction of the
Total Canadian Commitment as a result of a prepayment of the Canadian Loans
under Section 3.4 or Section 4.4.2.2 or Section 4.4.2.3, the Canadian Lenders
shall automatically reallocate the portion of their Canadian Commitments so
reduced to their Domestic Lender affiliate's Domestic Revolving Credit
Commitments, which commitment shall be increased by the U.S. Dollar Equivalent
of the amount of such reduction. The Total Canadian Commitment shall be
permanently reduced by the amount of such reallocation, and the Total Domestic
Revolving Commitment shall be increased by the same amount but in no event shall
exceed $44,500,000. Each of the Lenders and the Borrowers further agrees that
the Agent may make such conforming changes to this Credit Agreement as the Agent
may determine are necessary to accomplish the reallocations authorized herein,
including, without limitation, revisions to Schedule 1 and 2 hereto, provided
that prior to giving effect to any such changes, the Agent shall have provided
written notice to the applicable Lenders and the Borrowers of such changes. If
requested by the Agent, or any affected Lender, the Borrowers hereby agree to
issue new Notes, and the applicable Lenders agree to cancel and return any old
Notes that are replaced by such new Notes, as applicable in connection with any
such reallocations.

         2.4.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT NOTES.

                  2.4.1. DOMESTIC REVOLVING CREDIT NOTES. The Domestic Revolving
Credit Loans shall be evidenced by separate joint and several promissory notes
of the Domestic Borrowers in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto (each
a "Domestic Revolving Credit Note"), dated as of the Closing Date (or such other
date on which a Domestic Lender may become a party hereto in accordance with
Section 20 hereof) and completed with appropriate insertions. One Domestic
Revolving Credit Note shall be payable to the order of each Domestic Lender in a
principal amount equal to such Domestic Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit
Commitment or, if less, the Outstanding amount of all Domestic Revolving Credit
Loans made by such Domestic Lender, plus interest accrued thereon, as set forth
below.

                  2.4.2. CANADIAN NOTES. The Canadian Loans shall be evidenced
by either (a) separate promissory notes of the Canadian Borrower in
substantially the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto (each, a "Canadian Note"), dated as
of the date such facility is activated and completed with appropriate
insertions, or (b) this Credit Agreement and by individual loan accounts
maintained by the Agent on its books for each of the Canadian Lenders, it being
the intention of the parties hereto that, unless a Canadian Note is requested by
a Canadian Lender, the Canadian Borrower's obligations with respect to Canadian
Loans are to be evidenced only as stated herein and not by separate promissory
notes. If a Canadian Lender requests a Canadian Note, one Canadian Note shall be
payable to the order of such Canadian Lender in an amount equal to its Canadian
Commitment, and shall represent the obligation of the Canadian Borrower to pay
such Canadian Lender such principal amount or, if less, the outstanding
principal amount of all Canadian Loans made by such Canadian Lender, plus
interest accrued thereon, as set forth herein.


<PAGE>
                                      -27-


                  2.4.3. REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE RECORDS. Each of the Borrowers
irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make or cause to be made, at or about the
time of the Drawdown Date of any Domestic Revolving Credit Loan or Canadian
Loan, as the case may be, or at the time of receipt of any payment of principal
on any such Note, an appropriate notation on such Lender's Revolving Credit Note
Record reflecting the making of such Loan or (as the case may be) the receipt of
such payment. The Outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans set forth on
such Lender's Revolving Credit Note Record shall be prima facie evidence of the
principal amount thereof owing and unpaid to such Lender, but the failure to
record, or any error in so recording, any such amount on such Lender's Revolving
Credit Note Record shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the
Borrowers hereunder or under any such Notes to make payments of principal of or
interest on any Note when due.

         2.5. INTEREST ON REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 6.10,

                  (a) Each Domestic Revolving Credit Loan that is a Base Rate
         Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown
         Date thereof and ending on the last day of the Interest Period with
         respect thereto and thereafter during each subsequent Interest Period
         with respect thereto at an annual rate equal to the sum of (i) the Base
         Rate plus (ii) the Applicable Margin with respect to Revolving Credit
         Loans which are Base Rate Loans, as in effect from time to time while
         such Base Rate Loan is Outstanding.

                  (b) Each Domestic Revolving Credit Loan that is a Eurodollar
         Rate Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with the
         Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of the Interest Period
         with respect thereto and thereafter during each subsequent Interest
         Period at an annual rate equal to the sum of (i) the Eurodollar Rate
         plus (ii) the Applicable Margin with respect to Revolving Credit Loans
         which are Eurodollar Rate Loans, as in effect from time to time while
         such Eurodollar Rate Loan is Outstanding.

                  (c) Each Canadian Loan that is a Canadian Prime Rate Loan
         shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date
         thereof and ending on the last day of the Interest Period with respect
         thereto and thereafter during each subsequent Interest Period at an
         annual rate equal to the sum of (i) the Canadian Prime Rate plus (ii)
         the Applicable Margin with respect to Revolving Credit Loans which are
         Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as in effect from time to time while such
         Canadian Prime Rate Loan is Outstanding.

                  (d) Each Canadian Loan that is a Canadian Cost of Funds Loan
         shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date
         thereof and ending on the last day of the Interest Period with respect
         thereto and thereafter during each subsequent Interest Period at an
         annual rate equal to the sum of (i) the Canadian Cost of Funds Rate
         plus (ii) the Applicable Margin with respect to Revolving Credit Loans
         which are Canadian Cost of Funds Loans, as in effect from time to time
         while such Canadian Cost of Funds Loan is Outstanding.

                  (e) The Domestic Borrowers jointly and severally promise to
         pay interest on each Domestic Revolving Credit Loan in arrears on each
         Interest Payment Date with respect thereto. The Canadian Borrower
         promises to pay interest on each Canadian Loan in arrears on each
         Interest Payment Date with respect thereto.

         2.6.  REQUESTS FOR REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

                  2.6.1. REQUESTS FOR DOMESTIC REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. The
Domestic Borrowers shall give to the Agent telephonic and written notice (such
written notice to be in the form of


<PAGE>
                                      -28-



Exhibit B-1 hereto) of each Domestic Revolving Credit Loan requested hereunder
(a "Domestic Revolving Credit Loan Request") (a) prior to 1:00 p.m. (Boston
time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Base Rate Loan and (b) prior to 1:00
p.m. (Boston time) on the third Eurodollar Business Day prior to the proposed
Drawdown Date of any Eurodollar Rate Loan. Each such written notice shall
specify (w) the principal amount of the Domestic Revolving Credit Loan
requested, (x) the proposed Drawdown Date of such Domestic Revolving Credit
Loan, (y) if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Interest Period for such Domestic
Revolving Credit Loan and (z) the Type of such Domestic Revolving Credit Loan.
Upon receipt of any such notices, the Agent shall promptly notify each of the
Domestic Lenders thereof. Each Revolving Credit Loan Request shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Domestic Borrowers and shall obligate the
Domestic Borrowers to accept the Domestic Revolving Credit Loan requested from
the Domestic Lenders on the proposed Drawdown Date. Each Revolving Credit Loan
Request shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $250,000 or an integral
multiple thereof.

                  2.6.2. REQUESTS FOR CANADIAN LOANS. The Canadian Borrower
shall give to the Agent and each of the Canadian Lenders telephonic and written
notice (such written notice to be in the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto) of each
Canadian Loan requested hereunder (a "Canadian Loan Request") prior to 1:00 p.m.
(Boston time) on the third Canadian Business Day prior to the proposed Drawdown
Date of any Canadian Prime Rate Loan or Canadian Cost of Funds Loan. Each such
written notice shall specify (w) the principal amount of the Canadian Loan
requested and the aggregate Outstanding principal amount of the Canadian Loans
on such date, (x) the proposed Drawdown Date of such Canadian Loan, (y) if such
Canadian Loan is to be a Canadian Cost of Funds Loan, the Interest Period for
such Canadian Loan and (z) the Type of such Canadian Loan. Each Canadian Loan
Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the Canadian Borrower and shall
obligate the Canadian Borrower to accept the Canadian Loan requested from the
Canadian Lenders on the proposed Drawdown Date. Each Canadian Loan Request shall
be in a minimum aggregate amount of C$500,000 or an integral multiple of
C$100,000 thereof. Notwithstanding the notice and minimum amount requirements
set forth in this Section 2.6.2 but otherwise in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Credit Agreement, the Canadian Borrower may request that the
Canadian Lenders make Canadian Prime Rate Loan advances and paydowns to the
Canadian Borrower's deposit account with Bank One, NA, Canada such that if the
balance in the account: (i) is a credit, the Canadian Lenders may apply the
amount of such credit or any part thereof, rounded to the nearest C$50,000 as a
repayment of borrowings outstanding under the Canadian Commitment, or (ii) is a
debit, the Canadian Lenders shall make available a borrowing in an amount
rounded to the nearest C$50,000 which is required to place the Canadian Borrower
in a minimum net credit position of C$0, provided that there are sufficient
funds available under the Canadian Commitment.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Canadian Borrower
wishes all or any portion of the Canadian Loan which is requested to bear
interest at the Cost of Funds Rate, the Canadian Borrower may request by
telephonic (to be immediately confirmed in writing), facsimile or other written
notice (a "Rate Request") that Bank One, NA, Canada Branch on any Canadian
Business Day give the Canadian Borrower a firm quotation of the Cost of Funds
Rate which would be applicable to a Cost of Funds Loan to be made on such day
for an Interest Period commencing on the date of such Rate Request. Each Rate
Request shall (i) specify the aggregate principal amount of the Cost of Funds
Loan to which such quotation would apply (which shall be in a minimum aggregate
amount of C$100,000 or an integral multiple thereof), (ii) specify the Interest
Period being requested for such Cost of Funds Loan, and (iii) shall be received
by the Canadian Lender not later than 11:00 a.m., Boston time, on such day. At
or before 12:00 noon, Boston time, the Canadian Lender shall notify the Canadian
Borrower by telephone, telex or telecopier of the Cost of Funds Rate which would
apply to such Cost of Funds Loan; provided, however, that the Canadian Lender
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, decline to give any such quotation.
Such rate

<PAGE>
                                      -29-


quotation shall remain in effect for one hour on such day. If the Canadian
Borrower wishes to accept the rate quotation from the Canadian Lender and
thereby request such Cost of Funds Loan, the Canadian Borrower shall give the
Canadian Lender written notice of acceptance (a "Cost of Funds Rate
Acceptance"), no later than the expiration of such one hour period. Each Cost of
Funds Rate Acceptance may be given by telecopier and shall confirm the Canadian
Borrower's acceptance of such rate quotation and the aggregate principal amount
of the Cost of Funds Loan requested.

         2.7.  CONVERSION OPTIONS.

                  2.7.1. CONVERSION TO DIFFERENT TYPE OF DOMESTIC REVOLVING
CREDIT LOAN. The Domestic Borrowers may elect from time to time to convert any
Outstanding Domestic Revolving Credit Loan to a Domestic Revolving Credit Loan
of another Type, provided that (a) with respect to any such conversion of a Base
Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Domestic Borrowers shall give the Agent
at least three (3) Eurodollar Business Days prior written notice (confirmed
telephonically on the date of delivery of such written notice) or telephonic
notice (confirmed in writing on the date of such telephonic notice) of such
election; (b) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan into
a Base Rate Loan, such conversion shall only be made on the last day of the
Interest Period with respect thereto and (c) no Loan may be converted into a
Eurodollar Rate Loan when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. On the date on which such conversion is being made each Domestic
Lender shall take such action as is necessary to transfer its Domestic Revolving
Credit Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loans to its Domestic
Lending Office or its Eurodollar Lending Office, as the case may be. All or any
part of Outstanding Domestic Revolving Credit Loans of any Type may be converted
into a Domestic Revolving Credit Loan of another Type as provided herein,
provided that any conversion to a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $250,000 in excess thereof
and the amount of any Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be at least $250,000 or an
integral multiple thereof. Each Conversion Request relating to the conversion of
a Domestic Revolving Credit Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be irrevocable
by the Domestic Borrowers.

                  2.7.2. CONVERSION TO DIFFERENT TYPE OF CANADIAN LOAN. The
Canadian Borrower may elect from time to time to convert any outstanding
Canadian Loan to a Canadian Loan of another Type by providing a Conversion
Request to the Agent and each of the Canadian Lenders provided that (i) with
respect to any such conversion of a Canadian Prime Rate Loan to a Canadian Cost
of Funds Loan, the Canadian Borrower shall give the Agent and each of the
Canadian Lenders at least three (3) Canadian Business Days prior written notice
of such election; (ii) with respect to any such conversion of a Canadian Cost of
Funds Loan into a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, such conversion shall only be made
on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto unless any payment
required by Section 6.9 is made on or prior to the day of such conversion; and
(iii) unless each Canadian Lender otherwise agrees, no Canadian Prime Rate Loan
may be converted into a Canadian Cost of Funds Loan when any Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing. All or any part of outstanding Canadian
Loans of any Type may be converted into a Canadian Loan of another Type as
provided herein, provided that any partial conversion shall be a whole multiple
of C$100,000 and shall not be inconsistent with the requirements of Section 6.4
with respect to the maximum permissible number of Interest Periods of Canadian
Cost of Funds Loans. Each Conversion Request shall be irrevocable by the
Canadian Borrower.

                  2.7.3. CONTINUATION OF TYPE OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN. Any
Revolving Credit Loan of any Type may be continued as a Revolving Credit Loan of
the same Type upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by
compliance by the Domestic Borrowers or the Canadian Borrower, as applicable,
with the notice provisions contained in Section 2.7.1 or Section 2.7.2, as
applicable; provided that no Eurodollar Rate Loan or Canadian Cost of Funds Loan
may be continued as such when any Default or



<PAGE>
                                      -30-


Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, but shall be automatically
converted to a Base Rate Loan or Canadian Prime Rate Loan, as applicable, on the
last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto ending during the
continuance of any Default or Event of Default of which officers of the Agent
or, in the case of Canadian Loans, the Canadian Lenders, active upon the
Borrowers' account have actual knowledge. In the event that the Domestic
Borrowers or Canadian Borrower, as applicable, fail to provide any such notice
with respect to the continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan or Canadian Cost of
Funds Loan as such, then such Eurodollar Rate Loan or Canadian Cost of Funds
Loan shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan or Canadian Prime Rate
Loan, as applicable, on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.
The Agent shall notify the Domestic Lenders, promptly when any such automatic
conversion contemplated by this Section 2.7.3 with respect to Domestic Revolving
Credit Loans is scheduled to occur.

                  2.7.4. EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS AND CANADIAN COST OF FUNDS LOANS.
Any conversion to or from Revolving Credit Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans
or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to
such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal
amount of (a) all Domestic Revolving Credit Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans
having the same Interest Period shall not be less than $500,000 and shall equal
$500,000 or a whole multiple of $250,000 in excess thereof, and (b) all Canadian
Loans that are Canadian Cost of Funds Loans having the same Interest Period
shall not be less than C$500,000 and shall equal C$500,000 or a whole multiple
of C$100,000 in excess thereof. At no time shall there be more than six (6)
Domestic Revolving Credit Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans having different
Interest Periods or three (3) Canadian Loans that are Canadian Cost of Funds
Loans having different Interest Periods.

         2.8.  FUNDS FOR REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

                  2.8.1. FUNDING PROCEDURES. Not later than 3:00 p.m. (Boston
time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Domestic Revolving Credit Loans,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each of the Domestic Lenders will
make available to the Agent, at the Agent's Office, in immediately available
funds, the amount of such Domestic Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentage of the amount of the requested Domestic Revolving Credit Loans. Upon
receipt from each Domestic Lender of such amount, and upon receipt of the
documents required by Sections 12 and 13 and the satisfaction of the other
conditions set forth therein, to the extent applicable, (a) the Agent will make
available to the Domestic Borrowers the aggregate amount of such Domestic
Revolving Credit Loans made available to the Agent by the Domestic Lenders. Not
later than 3:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Canadian
Loans and upon receipt of the documents required by Sections 12 and 13 and the
satisfaction of the other conditions set forth therein, to the extent
applicable, each of the Canadian Lenders will make available to the Canadian
Borrower, in immediately available funds, the amount of such Canadian Lender's
Canadian Commitment Percentage of the amount of the requested Canadian Loans.
The failure or refusal of any Lender to make available to the Agent or the
Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, at the aforesaid time and place on any
Drawdown Date the amount of its Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage
of the requested Domestic Revolving Credit Loans or the amount of its Canadian
Commitment Percentage of the requested Canadian Loans shall not relieve any
other Lender from its several obligation hereunder to make available to the
Agent or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, the amount of such other
Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage or Canadian Commitment
Percentage of any requested Revolving Credit Loans.

                  2.8.2. ADVANCES BY AGENT OF DOMESTIC REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.
The Agent may unless notified to the contrary by any Domestic Lender prior to a
Drawdown Date, assume that such Domestic Lender has made available to the Agent
on such Drawdown Date the amount of such Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage of the Domestic Revolving Credit Loans to be made on such
Drawdown Date, and the Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance
upon such

<PAGE>
                                      -31-

assumption, make available to the Domestic Borrowers a corresponding amount. If
any Domestic Lender makes available to the Agent such amount on a date after
such Drawdown Date, such Domestic Lender shall pay to the Agent on demand an
amount equal to the product of (a) the average computed for the period referred
to in clause (c) below, of the weighted average interest rate paid by the Agent
for federal funds acquired by the Agent, during each day included in such
period, times (b) the amount of such Domestic Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage of such Domestic Revolving Credit Loans, times (c) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and
including such Drawdown Date to the date on which the amount of such Lender's
Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Domestic Revolving
Credit Loans shall become immediately available to the Agent and the denominator
of which is 360. A statement of the Agent submitted to such Domestic Lender with
respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be prima facie evidence
of the amount due and owing to the Agent by such Domestic Lender. If the amount
of such Domestic Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of
such Domestic Revolving Credit Loans is not made available to the Agent by such
Lender within three (3) Business Days following such Drawdown Date, the Agent
shall be entitled to recover such amount from the Borrowers on demand, with
interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans
made on such Drawdown Date.

        2.9. REQUESTS FOR LOANS, CONVERSIONS, ETC. Any provisions in Section 2
or Section 4 which requires the Domestic Borrowers to deliver any notices or
requests for Domestic Revolving Credit Loans or to convert Domestic Loans from
one Type of Loan to another is satisfied by any Domestic Borrower signing the
request or notice, and each Domestic Borrower agrees to be bound by such request
or notice.

                   3. REPAYMENT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

        3.1. MATURITY. The Domestic Borrowers jointly and severally promise to
pay on the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date, or at such earlier time as the
Domestic Revolving Credit Loans become due and payable as set forth herein, and
there shall become absolutely due and payable on the Revolving Credit Loan
Maturity Date, or at such earlier time as the Domestic Revolving Credit Loans
become due and payable as set forth herein, all of the Domestic Revolving Credit
Loans Outstanding on such date, together with any and all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon. The Canadian Borrower promises to pay on the Revolving Credit
Loan Maturity Date, or at such earlier time as the Canadian Loans become due and
payable as set forth herein, and there shall become absolutely due and payable
on the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date, or at such earlier time as the
Canadian Loans become due and payable as set forth herein, all of the Canadian
Loans Outstanding on such date, together with any and all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon.

        3.2. MANDATORY REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. If at any time (i)
the sum of the Outstanding amount of the Domestic Revolving Credit Loans, plus
the Maximum Drawing Amount of Letters of Credit, plus all Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations exceeds the Total Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment whether by
reduction of the Total Domestic Revolving Commitment or otherwise, or (ii) the
U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the Outstanding amount of the Canadian Loans, exceeds
the Total Canadian Commitment, whether by reduction of the Total Canadian
Commitment, due to currency fluctuations or otherwise, then in the case of
clause (i) above, the Domestic Borrowers shall immediately pay the amount of
such excess to the Agent for the respective accounts of the Domestic Lenders for
application to the Domestic Revolving Credit Loans, and in the case of clause
(ii) above, the Canadian Borrower shall immediately pay the amount of such
excess to the Canadian Lenders (within two (2) Business Days of notice thereof
if due to currency fluctuations) for the respective accounts of the Canadian
Lenders for application to the Canadian Loans in proportion, as nearly as
practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amount thereof, with adjustments
to the extent practicable to equalize any


<PAGE>

                                      -32-


prior payments or repayments not exactly in proportion. Each prepayment of
Domestic Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated among the Domestic Lenders,
in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal
amount of each Domestic Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit Note, with
adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior payments or
repayments not exactly in proportion. Each prepayment pursuant to this Section
3.2 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.9. In addition
to the mandatory prepayment required by the preceding sentences, the Borrowers
shall also prepay the Revolving Credit Loans as required pursuant to Section
4.4.2. If no Revolving Credit Loans shall be outstanding, such amounts shall be
held by the Agent for the benefit of the applicable Lenders as collateral
security for such excess Maximum Drawing Amount; provided however, that if the
amount of cash collateral held by the Agent pursuant to this Section 3.2 exceeds
the Maximum Drawing Amount required to be collateralized from time to time, the
Agent shall return such excess to the applicable Borrowers.

        3.3. MANDATORY CLEAN DOWN. For a period of at least 15 consecutive days
during each rolling period of 180 days following the Closing Date, the aggregate
amount of the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding plus the Maximum Drawing
Amount, plus all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations shall not exceed $25,000,000.
At the beginning of each such fifteen (15) day period, the Borrowers shall pay
down outstanding Revolving Credit Loans to such level.

        3.4. OPTIONAL REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. The applicable
Borrowers shall have the right, at their election, to repay the Outstanding
amount of the Revolving Credit Loans, as a whole or in part, at any time without
penalty or premium, provided that any full or partial prepayment of the
outstanding amount of any Eurodollar Rate Loans or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans
pursuant to this Section 3.4 that is not made on the last day of the Interest
Period relating thereto shall be accompanied by any amounts due under Section
6.9 hereunder. The Borrowers shall give the Agent and each Canadian Lender (if
applicable), no later than 1:00 p.m., Boston time, on the date of any proposed
prepayment prior written notice (confirmed telephonically on the date of
delivery of such written notice, but in any case such confirmation to occur no
later than 1:00 p.m., Boston time, on the date of any such proposed prepayment)
or telephonic notice (confirmed in writing on the date of such telephonic
notice) of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this Section 3.4 of Base Rate
Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans and no later than 1:00 p.m., Boston time,
three (3) Eurodollar Business Days or three (3) Canadian Business Days, as
applicable, prior to the date of any proposed repayment, prior written notice
(confirmed telephonically on the date of delivery of such written notice) or
telephonic notice (confirmed in writing on the date of such telephonic notice)
of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this Section 3.4 of Eurodollar Rate Loans
or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans, in each case specifying the proposed date of
prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans and the principal amount to be prepaid.
Each such partial prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be in a minimum
amount of $500,000 or an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or the
Canadian Dollar Equivalent thereof), shall be accompanied by the payment of
accrued interest on the principal prepaid to the date of prepayment and shall be
applied, in the absence of instruction by the Borrowers, first to the principal
of Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans (as applicable) and then to the
principal of Eurodollar Rate Loans or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans (as
applicable). Each partial prepayment received from Domestic Borrowers shall be
allocated among the Domestic Lenders, in proportion, as nearly as practicable,
to the respective unpaid principal amount of each Domestic Lender's Revolving
Credit Note, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior
repayments not exactly in proportion. Each partial prepayment by the Canadian
Borrower shall be paid by the Canadian Borrower directly to each Canadian Lender
in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective Canadian Commitment
of each Canadian Lender, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize
any prior repayments not exactly in proportion. The Total Canadian Commitment
shall be permanently reduced by each optional repayment of the Canadian Loans
hereunder until the total U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the Canadian Commitment is
$500,000, and the Total Domestic Revolving Commitment shall be increased by the
same amount in accordance with Section 2.3.2 hereof.

        4.1. COMMITMENT TO LEND. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Credit Agreement, each Domestic Lender agrees to lend to the Domestic
Borrowers, on the Closing Date, the amount of its Term A Commitment Percentage
of the principal amount of $15,000,000.

        4.2. THE TERM A NOTE. Term Loan A shall be evidenced by separate joint

of Exhibit C hereto (each a "Term A Note" and collectively the "Term A Notes"),
dated the Closing Date (or such other date on which a Domestic Lender may become
a party hereto in accordance with Section 20 and completed with appropriate
insertions. One Term A Note shall be payable to the order of each Domestic
Lender in a principal amount equal to such Domestic Lender's Term A Commitment
Percentage of Term Loan A and representing the obligation of the Domestic
Borrowers to pay to such Domestic Lender such principal amount or, if less, such
Lender's Term A Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of Term Loan A,
plus interest accrued thereon, as set forth below. Each of the Domestic
Borrowers irrevocably authorizes each Domestic Lender to make or cause to be
made a notation on such Domestic Lender's Term Note Record reflecting the
original principal amount of such Domestic Lender's Term A Commitment Percentage
of Term Loan A and, at or about the time of such Domestic Lender's receipt of
any principal payment on such Domestic Lender's Term A Note, an appropriate
notation on such Domestic Lender's Term Note Record reflecting such payment. The
aggregate unpaid amount set forth on such Domestic Lender's Term Note Record
shall be prima facie evidence of the principal amount thereof owing and unpaid
to such Domestic Lender, but the failure to record, or any error in so
recording, any such amount on such Domestic Lender's Term Note Record shall not
affect the obligations of the Domestic Borrowers hereunder or under any Term A
Note to make payments of principal of and interest on any Term A Note when due.

        4.3. REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OF TERM LOAN A. The Domestic Borrowers
jointly and severally promise to pay to the Agent, for the pro rata accounts of

in an amount equal to $833,333 on the last day of each fiscal quarter of the
Domestic Borrowers, with a final payment of Term Loan A on the Term Loan A
Maturity Date in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of Term Loan A.

        4.4. PREPAYMENT OF TERM LOAN A.

                 4.4.1. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT. At any time no Revolving Credit
Loans are Outstanding, the Domestic Borrowers shall have the right at any time
to prepay the Term A Notes, as a whole, or in part, upon not less than three (3)
Business Days prior written notice to the Agent, provided that (i) each partial
prepayment shall be in the principal amount of $1,000,000 or a larger integral
multiple thereof, (ii) any portion of the Term Loan A bearing interest at the
Eurodollar Rate that is prepaid pursuant to this Section 4.4 on a day other than
the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto shall be accompanied by any
amounts due under Section 6.9, (iii) each partial prepayment of Term Loan A
shall be allocated among the Domestic Lenders, in proportion, as nearly as
practicable, to the respective outstanding amount of each Domestic Lender's Term
A Note, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior
prepayments not exactly in proportion. Any prepayment of principal of the Term
Loan A shall include all interest accrued to the date of prepayment and shall be
applied pro rata to the remaining scheduled installments of principal due on the
Term Loan A. No amount repaid with respect to the Term Loan A may be reborrowed.

        prepayments pursuant to Section 4.4.2.1 shall be applied first, to the
        principal of Term Loan A based upon the outstanding amounts thereof and
        against the remaining scheduled installments of the Term Loan A in
        inverse order of maturity until the Term Loan A is paid in full, second,
        to repay the Domestic Revolving Credit Loans and third, to repay the

        2.3.2 hereof. Any prepayment of any portion of the principal of the Term
        Loan A shall include all interest accrued on such portion of the Term
        Loan A to the date of prepayment. No amount repaid with respect to the

Term Loan A shall bear interest during each Interest Period relating to all or
any portion of the Term Loan A at the following rates:

                (a) To the extent that all or any portion of Term Loan A bears
        interest during such Interest Period determined by reference to the Base
        Rate, Term Loan A or such portion thereof shall bear interest during
        such Interest Period at the rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the
        Base Rate plus (ii) the Applicable Margin with respect to portions of
        Term Loan A consisting of Base Rate Loans as in effect from time to
        time.

                (b) To the extent that all or any portion of Term Loan A bears
        interest during such Interest Period determined by reference to the
        Eurodollar Rate, Term Loan A or such portion thereof shall bear interest
        during such Interest Period at the rate per annum equal to the sum of
        (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus (ii) the Applicable Margin with respect to
        portions of Term Loan A consisting of Eurodollar Rate Loans as in effect
        from time to time.

                (c) The Domestic Borrowers jointly and severally promise to pay

OPTIONS. The Domestic Borrowers shall notify the Agent, such notice to be
irrevocable, at least three (3) Eurodollar Business Days prior to the Drawdown

interest at the Eurodollar Rate. With respect to the Term Loan A, the provisions
of Section 2.7 shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to all or any portion
of the Term Loan A so that the Domestic Borrowers may have the same interest
rate options with respect to all or any portion of the Term Loan A as they would
be entitled to with respect to the Domestic Revolving Credit Loans.

the Eurodollar Rate relating to any Interest Period shall be in the amount of
$500,000 or an integral multiple thereof. No Interest Period relating to the
Term Loan A or any portion thereof bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate shall
extend beyond the date on which a regularly scheduled installment payment of the
principal of the Term Loan A is to be made unless either (i) a portion of the
Term Loan A at least equal to such installment payment has an Interest Period
ending on or prior to such date or (ii) there are Base Rate Loans outstanding in
an amount at least equal to such installment payment. At no time shall there be
more than three (3) portions of Term Loan A that are Eurodollar Rate Loans

representations and warranties of the Domestic Borrowers contained herein,
agrees, in its individual capacity, to issue, extend and renew for the account
of the Domestic Borrowers one or more standby or documentary letters of credit
(individually, a "Letter of Credit"), in such form as may be requested from time

Domestic Borrowers or their Subsidiaries described in clauses (i) or (ix) of the
definition of "Indebtedness" hereunder to the extent that such Indebtedness was
incurred prior to the proposed issuance date of such Letter of Credit, unless in
any such case the Domestic Borrowers demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Agent that (x) such prior incurred Indebtedness was then fully secured by a
prior perfected and unavoidable security interest in collateral provided by the
Domestic Borrowers or such Subsidiary to the proposed beneficiary of such Letter
of Credit or (y) such prior incurred Indebtedness were then secured or supported
by a letter of credit issued for the account of such Domestic Borrower or such
Subsidiary and the reimbursement obligation with respect to such letter of
credit was fully secured by a prior perfected and unavoidable security interest
in collateral provided to the issuer of such letter of credit by such Domestic
Borrower or such Subsidiary.

                 5.1.2. LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATIONS. Each Letter of Credit
Application shall be completed to the satisfaction of the Agent. In the event
that any provision of any Letter of Credit Application shall be inconsistent
with any provision of this Credit Agreement, then the provisions of this Credit
Agreement shall, to the extent of any such inconsistency, govern.

                 5.1.3. TERMS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Letter of Credit
issued, extended or renewed hereunder shall, among other things, (a) provide for
the payment of sight drafts for honor thereunder when presented in accordance
with the terms thereof and when accompanied by the documents described therein,
and (b) have an expiry date no later than the date which is fourteen (14) days
(or, if the Letter of Credit is confirmed by a confirmer or otherwise provides
for one or more nominated persons, forty-five (45) days) prior to the Revolving
Credit Loan Maturity Date. Each Letter of Credit so issued, extended or renewed
shall be subject to the Uniform Customs.

                 5.1.4. REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS OF DOMESTIC LENDERS. Each
Domestic Lender severally agrees that it shall be absolutely liable, without
regard to the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or any other
condition precedent whatsoever, to the extent of such Lender's Domestic
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage to reimburse the Agent on demand for the
amount of each draft paid by the Agent under each Letter of Credit to the extent
that such amount is not reimbursed by the Domestic Borrowers pursuant to Section
5.2 (such agreement for a Lender being called herein the "Letter of Credit
Participation" of such Lender).

                 5.1.5. PARTICIPATIONS OF DOMESTIC LENDERS. Each such payment
made by a Lender shall be treated as the purchase by such Lender of a
participating interest in the applicable Borrowers' Reimbursement Obligation
under Section 5.2 in an amount equal to such payment. Each Domestic Lender shall
share in accordance with its participating interest in any interest which
accrues pursuant to Section 5.2.

                 5.2. REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF THE DOMESTIC BORROWERS. In
order to induce the Agent to issue, extend and renew each Letter of Credit and
the Domestic Lenders to participate therein, the Domestic Borrowers hereby
jointly and severally agree to reimburse or pay to the Agent, for the account of
the Agent or (as the case may be) the Domestic Lenders, with respect to each
Letter of Credit, issued, extended or renewed by the Agent hereunder,

                (a) except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 5.2(b) and
        (c), on each date that any draft presented under any Letter of Credit is
        honored by the Agent, or the Agent otherwise makes a payment with
        respect thereto (such date referred to herein as an "LC Payment Date"),
        (i) the

<PAGE>
                                      -38-


        amount paid by the Agent under or with respect to such Letter of Credit,
        and (ii) the amount of any taxes, fees, charges or other costs and
        expenses whatsoever incurred by the Agent or any Lender in connection
        with any payment made by the Agent or any Lender under, or with respect
        to, such Letter of Credit (collectively, an "LC Payment Amount");
        provided, that unless the Domestic Borrowers otherwise notify the Agent
        prior to the making of such LC Payment Amount by the Agent, the Domestic
        Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested a Domestic Revolving Credit
        Loan that is a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.6 in an amount equal
        to the LC Payment Amount with a Drawdown Date on the LC Payment Date.
        The Agent shall apply the proceeds of any such Domestic Revolving Credit
        Loan (and the Borrowers hereby authorize such application) to the
        Domestic Borrowers' Reimbursement Obligations with respect to the LC
        Payment Amounts;

                (b) upon the reduction (but not termination) of the Total
        Revolving Credit Commitment to an amount less than the Maximum Drawing
        Amount, an amount equal to such difference, which amount shall be held
        by the Agent for the benefit of the Domestic Lenders and Agent as cash
        collateral for all Reimbursement Obligations, and

                (c) upon the termination of the Total Domestic Revolving Credit
        Commitment, or the acceleration of the Reimbursement Obligations with
        respect to all Letters of Credit in accordance with Section 14, an
        amount equal to the then Maximum Drawing Amount of all Letters of Credit
        shall be paid by the Domestic Borrowers to the Agent which amount shall
        be held by the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agent as
        cash collateral for all Reimbursement Obligations.

Each such payment shall be made to the Agent at the Agent's Office in
immediately available funds. Interest on any and all amounts remaining unpaid by
the Domestic Borrowers under this Section 5.2 at any time from the date such
amounts become due and payable (whether as stated in this Section 5.2, by
acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full (whether before or after
judgment) shall be payable to the Agent on demand at the rate specified in
Section 6.10 for overdue principal on the Domestic Revolving Credit Loans.

        5.3. LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS. If any draft shall be presented or other
demand for payment shall be made under any Letter of Credit, the Agent shall
notify the Domestic Borrowers of the date and amount of the draft presented or
demand for payment and of the date and time when it expects to pay such draft or
honor such demand for payment. If the Domestic Borrowers fail to reimburse the
Agent as provided in Section 5.2 on or before the date that such draft is paid
or other payment is made by the Agent, the Agent may at any time thereafter
notify the Domestic Lenders of the amount of any such Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligation. No later than 3:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the Business Day next
following the receipt of such notice, each Domestic Lender shall make available
to the Agent, at the Agent's Office, in immediately available funds, such
Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid
Reimbursement Obligation, together with an amount equal to the product of (i)
the average, computed for the period referred to in clause (iii) below, of the
weighted average interest rate paid by the Agent for federal funds acquired by
the Agent during each day included in such period, times (ii) the amount equal
to such Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid
Reimbursement Obligation, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days that elapse from and including the date the Agent paid the draft
presented for honor or otherwise made payment to the date on which such Lender's
Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligation shall become immediately available to the Agent, and the denominator
of which is 360. The responsibility of the Agent to the Domestic Borrowers and
the Lenders shall be only to determine that the documents (including each draft)
delivered under each Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment shall
be in conformity in all material respects with such Letter of Credit.

                                      -39-


        5.4. OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Domestic Borrowers' obligations under
this Section 5 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and irrespective of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default or any condition precedent whatsoever or any setoff, counterclaim or
defense to payment which any of the Borrowers may have or have had against the
Agent, any Domestic Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, other than
claims arising due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or
any Domestic Lender. Each of the Domestic Borrowers further agrees with the
Agent and the Domestic Lenders that neither the Agent nor any Domestic Lender
shall be responsible for, and the Domestic Borrowers' Reimbursement Obligations
under Section 5.2 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or
genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents
should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged,
or any dispute between or among the Domestic Borrowers, the beneficiary of any
Letter of Credit or any financing institution or other party to which any Letter
of Credit may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of any of the
Borrowers against the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such
transferee. The Agent and the Domestic Lenders shall not be liable for any
error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of
any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of
Credit. Each of the Domestic Borrowers agrees that any action taken or omitted
by the Agent or any Domestic Lender under or in connection with each Letter of
Credit and the related drafts and documents, if done in good faith, shall be
binding upon the Domestic Borrowers and shall not result in any liability on the
part of the Agent or any Domestic Lender to the Domestic Borrowers.

        5.5. RELIANCE BY THE AGENT. To the extent not inconsistent with Section
5.4, the Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in
relying upon, any Letter of Credit, draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and
other experts selected by the Agent. In connection with any such document, the
Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Credit Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or
concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it
shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Domestic
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Credit Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
upon the Domestic Lenders and all future holders of the Domestic Revolving
Credit Notes or of a Letter of Credit Participation.

        5.6. LETTER OF CREDIT FEE. With respect to each Letter of Credit issued
hereunder, the Domestic Borrowers shall pay to the Agent a fee (the "Letter of
Credit Fee") for each Letter of Credit issued or renewed by the Agent at a rate
per annum equal to the Applicable Margin with respect to Letters of Credit in
effect from time to time, on the Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit
for the period such Letter of Credit is outstanding. The Agent shall, in turn,
remit to each Domestic Lender (including Fleet) such Lender's Domestic Revolving
Credit Commitment Percentage of the Letter of Credit Fee. In addition, the
Domestic Borrowers will pay the Agent, for its own account, a Fronting Fee (the
"Fronting Fee") equal to one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) per annum on the
Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit for the period such Letter of
Credit is outstanding. The Letter of Credit Fee and the Fronting Fee shall be
payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter for the
calendar quarter then ending. In respect of each Letter of Credit, the Domestic
Borrowers shall also pay to the Agent, for its own account, at such time or
times as such charges are customarily made by the Agent, the Agent's customary
issuance, amendment, negotiation or document examination and other
administrative fees as in effect from time to time.

                         6. CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS.

        6.1. FEES. The Domestic Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay to
the Agent all fees described in the Fee Letter in accordance with the terms
thereof.

        6.2. FUNDS FOR PAYMENTS.

                 6.2.1. PAYMENTS TO AGENT AND CANADIAN LENDERS. All payments of
principal and interest in respect of Domestic Loans, Reimbursement Obligations,
Domestic Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and any other amounts due
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents from the Domestic Borrowers
shall be made to the Agent for the respective accounts of the applicable Lenders
and the Agent, at the Agent's Office or at such other location in the Boston,
Massachusetts, area that the Agent may from time to time designate, in each case
at or about 11:00 a.m. (Boston time) in immediately available funds. All
payments of principal and interest in respect of Canadian Loans, Reimbursement
Obligations, Canadian Commitment Fees and any other amounts due hereunder or
under any of the other Loan Documents from the Canadian Borrower shall be made
to each Canadian Lender for its respective account, at such Canadian Lender's
office or at such other location that such Canadian Lender may from time to time
designate, in each case at or about 11:00 a.m. (Boston time) in immediately
available funds.

                 6.2.2. NO OFFSET, ETC. All payments by the Borrowers hereunder
and under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made without setoff or
counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans,
restrictions or conditions of any nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by
any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other
authority therein unless the Borrowers are compelled by law to make such
deduction or withholding. If any such obligation is imposed upon the Borrowers
with respect to any amount payable by them hereunder or under any of the other
Loan Documents, the applicable Domestic Borrowers will pay to the applicable
Canadian Lender in the case of a payment by the Canadian Borrower or the Agent
for the account of the applicable Domestic Lenders or the Agent (as the case may
be)(in the case of a payment by a Domestic Borrower), on the date on which such
amount is due and payable hereunder or under such other Loan Document, such
additional amount in U.S. Dollars or Canadian Dollars, as applicable, as shall
be necessary to enable the applicable Lenders or the Agent to receive the same
net amount which such Lenders or the Agent would have received on such due date
had no such obligation been imposed upon the Borrowers. The Borrowers will
deliver promptly to the Agent certificates or other valid vouchers for all taxes
or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by the
Borrowers hereunder or under such other Loan Document.

        6.3. COMPUTATIONS. All computations of interest on Base Rate Loans and
Canadian Prime Rate Loans shall be based on a 365-day year and the actual number
of days elapsed. All computations of interest on the Eurodollar Rate Loans and
Canadian Cost of Funds Loans and of Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees,
Fronting Fees or other fees shall be based on a 360-day year and paid for the
actual number of days elapsed. Except as otherwise provided in the definition of
the term "Interest Period" with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans and Canadian
Cost of Funds Loans, whenever a payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest
shall accrue during such extension. The outstanding amount of the Loans as
reflected on the Revolving Credit Note Records and the Term Note Records from
time to time shall be considered correct and binding on the Borrowers absent
manifest error.

        Wherever interest is calculated on the basis of a period which is less
than the actual number of days in a calendar year, each rate of interest
determined pursuant to such calculation, for the purposes of the Interest Act
(Canada) is equivalent to such rate multiplied by the actual number of days in
the calendar


<PAGE>
                                      -41-


year in which such rate is to be ascertained and divided by the number of days
used as the basis of that calculation.

        6.4. INABILITY TO DETERMINE EURODOLLAR RATE OR CANADIAN COST OF FUNDS
RATE. In the event, prior to the commencement of any Interest Period relating to
any Eurodollar Rate Loan or Canadian Cost of Funds Loan, the Agent shall
determine or be notified by the Required Lenders or the Canadian Lenders, as
applicable, that adequate and reasonable methods do not exist for ascertaining
the Eurodollar Rate or Canadian Cost of Funds Rate, as applicable, that would
otherwise determine the rate of interest to be applicable to any Eurodollar Rate
Loan or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans during any Interest Period, the Agent shall
forthwith give notice of such determination (which shall be conclusive and
binding on the applicable Borrowers and the applicable Lenders) to the
applicable Borrowers and the applicable Lenders. In such event (i) any Revolving
Credit Loan Request or Conversion Request with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans
or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans, as applicable, shall be automatically withdrawn
and shall be deemed a request for Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans,
as applicable, (ii) each Eurodollar Rate Loan or Canadian Cost of Funds Loan, as
applicable, will automatically, on the last day of the then current Interest
Period relating thereto, become a Base Rate Loan or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan,
as applicable, and (iii) the obligations of the applicable Lenders to make
Eurodollar Rate Loans or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans shall be suspended until
the Agent or the Required Lenders determine that the circumstances giving rise
to such suspension no longer exist, whereupon the Agent, upon the instruction of
the Required Lenders, shall so notify the applicable Borrowers and the
applicable Lenders.

        6.5. ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if any
present or future law, regulation, treaty or directive or in the interpretation
or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Loans or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans, as applicable, such
Lender shall forthwith give notice of such circumstances to the applicable
Borrowers and the other applicable Lenders and thereupon (i) the commitment of
such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans, as
the case may be, or convert Loans of another Type to Eurodollar Rate Loans or
Canadian Cost of Funds Loans, as the case may be, shall forthwith be suspended
and (ii) such Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding as
Eurodollar Rate Loans or Canadian Loans then outstanding as Canadian Cost of
Funds Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans or
Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as applicable, on the last day of each Interest
Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans or Canadian Cost of Funds Loans,
as the case may be, or within such earlier period as may be required by law.
Each of the Domestic Borrowers (with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans) and the
Canadian Borrower (with respect to Canadian Cost of Funds Loans) hereby agrees
promptly to pay the Agent for the account of such Lender, upon demand by such
Lender, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs
incurred by such Lender in making any conversion in accordance with this Section
6.5, including any interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans or
Canadian Cost of Funds Loans, as applicable, hereunder.

        6.6. ADDITIONAL COSTS, ETC. If any present or future applicable law,
which expression, as used herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations
thereunder and interpretations thereof by any competent court or by any
governmental or other regulatory body or official charged with the
administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives,
instructions and notices at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or
otherwise issued to any Lender or the Agent by any central bank or other fiscal,
monetary or other authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall:

                (a) subject any Lender or the Agent to any tax, levy, impost,
        duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding of any nature with respect
        to this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any Letters of
        Credit, such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment or the Loans



<PAGE>
                                      -42-


        (other than taxes based upon or measured by the income or profits of
        such Lender or the Agent), or

                (b) materially change the basis of taxation (except for changes
        in taxes on income or profits) of payments to any Lender of the
        principal of or the interest on any Loans or any other amounts payable
        to any Lender or the Agent under this Credit Agreement or any of the
        other Loan Documents, or

                (c) impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the
        extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this Credit Agreement) any
        special deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or
        other similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law)
        against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans
        by, or letters of credit issued by, or commitments of an office of any
        Lender, or

                (d) impose on any Lender or the Agent any other conditions or
        requirements with respect to this Credit Agreement, the other Loan
        Documents, any Letters of Credit, the Loans, such Lender's Revolving
        Credit Commitment, or any class of loans, letters of credit or
        commitments of which any of the Loans, or such Lender's Revolving Credit
        Commitment forms a part, and the result of any of the foregoing is

                        (i) to increase the cost to any Lender of making,
                funding, issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining any of the
                Loans or such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment or any Letter
                of Credit; or

                        (ii) to reduce the amount of principal, interest,
                Reimbursement Obligation or other amount payable to such Lender
                or the Agent hereunder on account of such Lender's Revolving
                Credit Commitment, any Letter of Credit, or any of the Loans, or

                        (iii) to require such Lender or the Agent to make any
                payment or to forego any interest or Reimbursement Obligation or
                other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which payment or
                foregone interest or Reimbursement Obligation or other sum is
                calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum
                receivable or deemed received by such Lender or the Agent from
                any of the Borrowers hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Canadian Borrower, in the case of Canadian
Loans, and the Domestic Borrowers in each other case, will, upon demand made by
such Lender or (as the case may be) the Agent at any time and from time to time
and as often as the occasion therefore may arise, pay to such Lender or the
Agent such additional amounts as will be sufficient to compensate such Lender or
the Agent for such additional cost, reduction, payment or foregone interest or
Reimbursement Obligation or other sum.

        6.7. CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If after the date hereof any Lender or the Agent
determines that (i) the adoption of or change in any law, governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies or any
change in the interpretation or application thereof by a court or governmental
authority with appropriate jurisdiction, or (ii) compliance by such Lender or
the Agent or any corporation controlling such Lender or the Agent with any such
law, governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive issued after
the date hereof (whether or not having the force of law) of any such entity
regarding capital adequacy, has the effect of reducing the return on such
Lender's or the Agent's commitment with respect to any Loans or Letters of
Credit to a level below that which such Lender or the Agent could have achieved
but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such
Lender's or the Agent's then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy
and assuming full utilization of such entity's capital) by any



<PAGE>
                                      -43-


amount deemed by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Agent to be material,
then such Lender or the Agent may notify the Borrowers of such fact. To the
extent that the amount of such reduction in the return on capital is not
reflected in the Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate, as applicable, the Canadian
Borrower, in the case of the Canadian Lenders, and the Domestic Borrowers in the
case of the Domestic Lenders, agree to pay such Lender or (as the case may be)
the Agent for the amount of such reduction in the return on capital as and when
such reduction is determined upon presentation by such Lender or (as the case
may be) the Agent of a certificate in accordance with Section 6.8 hereof. Each
Lender shall allocate such cost increases among its customers in good faith and
on an equitable basis.

        6.8. CERTIFICATE. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts
payable pursuant to Sections 6.6 or 6.7 and a brief explanation of such amounts
which are due, submitted by any Lender or the Agent to the applicable Borrowers
and the Agent, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts are
due and owing.

        6.9. INDEMNITY. The Domestic Borrowers jointly and severally agree to
indemnify each Domestic Lender and to hold each Domestic Lender harmless from
and against any loss, cost or expense (including loss of anticipated profits
actually incurred but not other consequential damages) that such Domestic Lender
may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) default by the Domestic Borrowers
in payment of the principal amount of or any interest on any Eurodollar Rate
Loans as and when due and payable, including any such loss or expense arising
from interest or fees payable by such Domestic Lender to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) default by
the Domestic Borrowers in making a borrowing or conversion after the Domestic
Borrowers have given (or are deemed to have given) a Revolving Credit Loan
Request, notice (in the case of all or any portion of the Term Loan A pursuant
to Section 4.6) or a Conversion Request relating thereto in accordance with
Section 2.6 or Section 2.7 or Section 4.6 or (iii) the making of any payment of
a Eurodollar Rate Loan or the making of any conversion of any such Loan to a
Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest
Period with respect thereto, including interest or fees payable by such Domestic
Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain any such Loans.
The Canadian Borrower agrees to indemnify each Canadian Lender and to hold each
Canadian Lender harmless from and against any loss, cost or expense (including
loss of anticipated profits actually incurred but not other consequential
damages) that such Canadian Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (A)
default by the Canadian Borrower in payment of the principal amount of or any
interest on any Canadian Cost of Funds Loans as and when due and payable,
including any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by such
Canadian Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its
Canadian Cost of Funds Loans, (B) default by the Canadian Borrower in making a
borrowing or conversion after the Canadian Borrower has given (or is deemed to
have given) a Canadian Loan Request or a Conversion Request relating thereto in
accordance with Section 2.6 or Section 2.7 or (C) the repayment of any Canadian
Cost of Funds Loan or the conversion of any such Canadian Cost of Funds Loan to
a Canadian Prime Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the applicable
Interest Period with respect thereto, including interest or fees payable by such
Canadian Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain any such
Canadian Loans.

        6.10. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT.

                 6.10.1. OVERDUE AMOUNTS. Overdue principal and (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) interest on the Loans and all other overdue amounts
payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall bear interest
compounded monthly and payable on demand at a rate per annum equal to (a) with
respect to Domestic Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder, the Base Rate
plus the Applicable


<PAGE>
                                      -44-


Margin for Base Rate Loans plus two percent (2%) per annum, (b) with respect to
Canadian Loans, the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Canadian
Prime Rate Loans plus two percent (2%) per annum and (c) with respect to Term
Loan A, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Term Loan A plus two
percent (2%) per annum, in each case until such amount shall be paid in full
(after as well as before judgment).

                 6.10.2. AMOUNTS NOT OVERDUE. During the continuance of an Event
of Default the principal of the Loans not overdue shall, until such Event of
Default has been cured or remedied or such Event of Default has been waived by
the Lenders pursuant to Section 27, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
(a) with respect to Domestic Loans, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for
Base Rate Loans plus two percent (2%) per annum and (b) with respect to Canadian
Loans, the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Canadian Prime
Rate Loans plus two percent (2%) per annum.

                 6.10.3. LETTERS OF CREDIT. The Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations
and (to the extent permitted by law) unpaid interest thereon (as provided in
this sentence) shall bear interest compounded monthly and payable on demand at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate
Loans then in effect with respect to Revolving Credit Loans plus two percent
(2%) per annum until such amount shall be paid in full (after as well as before
judgment).

        6.11. CONCERNING JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF THE DOMESTIC BORROWERS.

                (a) Each of the Domestic Borrowers is accepting joint and
        several liability hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in
        consideration of the financial accommodations to be provided by the
        Agent and the Lenders under this Credit Agreement, for the mutual
        benefit, directly and indirectly, of each of the Borrowers and in
        consideration of the undertakings of each other Domestic Borrower to
        accept joint and several liability for the Obligations (including the
        Canadian Obligations).

                (b) Each of the Domestic Borrowers, jointly and severally,
        hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety
        but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other
        Domestic Borrowers, with respect to the payment and performance of all
        of the Obligations of both the Domestic Borrowers and the Canadian
        Borrower (including, without limitation, any Obligations arising under
        this Section 6.11), it being the intention of the parties hereto that
        all the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each
        of the Domestic Borrowers without preferences or distinction among them.

                (c) If and to the extent that any of the Borrowers shall fail to
        make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due
        or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms
        thereof, then in each such event any other Domestic Borrowers will make
        such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation.

                (d) The Obligations of each of the Domestic Borrowers under the
        provisions of this Section 6.11 constitute the full recourse Obligations
        of each of the Domestic Borrowers enforceable against each such Person
        to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the
        validity, regularity or enforceability of this Credit Agreement or the
        other Loan Documents or any other circumstance whatsoever as to any
        other Domestic Borrower.

                (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Domestic
        Borrower hereby waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand,
        protest, notice of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice
        of any and all advances of the Loans made under this Credit Agreement
        and the Notes, notice of occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
        (except to the extent notice is expressly required to be given pursuant
        to the terms of this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan
        Documents), or of any demand for any payment under this Credit
        Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by the
        Agent or the Lenders under or in respect of any


<PAGE>
                                      -45-


        of the Obligations hereunder, any requirement of diligence and,
        generally, all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in
        connection with this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each
        Domestic Borrower hereby waives all defenses which may be available by
        virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now
        or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshaling of assets of
        the Borrowers and any other entity or Person primarily or secondarily
        liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all suretyship
        defenses generally. Each Domestic Borrower hereby assents to, and waives
        notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment, or
        place or manner for payment, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or
        renewals of any of the Obligations hereunder, the acceptance of any
        partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or
        acquiescence by the Agent and the Lenders at any time or times in
        respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or
        satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this
        Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any and all other
        indulgences whatsoever by the Agent and the Lenders in respect of any of
        the Obligations hereunder, and the taking, addition, substitution or
        release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for
        any of such Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in
        whole or in part, of any Borrower or any other entity or Person
        primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation. Such Domestic
        Borrower further agrees that its Obligations shall not be released or
        discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by the adequacy
        of any rights which the Agent or any Lender may have against any
        collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of any of the
        Obligations, the impairment of any collateral security securing the
        Obligations, including, without limitation, the failure to protect or
        preserve any rights which the Agent or any Lender may have in such
        collateral security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release,
        loss or destruction of any such collateral security, any other act or
        omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of
        such Domestic Borrower, or otherwise operate as a release or discharge
        of such Domestic Borrower, all of which may be done without notice to
        such Domestic Borrower; provided, however, that the foregoing shall in
        no way be deemed to create commercially unreasonable standards as to the
        Agent's duties as secured party under the Loan Documents (as such rights
        and duties are set forth therein). If for any reason any of the other
        Borrowers has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to
        discharge any of the Obligations, or if any of the Obligations have
        become irrecoverable from any of the other Borrowers by reason of such
        other Borrower's insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other
        operation of law or for any reason, this Credit Agreement and the other
        Loan Documents to which it is a party shall nevertheless be binding on
        such Domestic Borrower to the same extent as if such Domestic Borrower
        at all times had been the sole obligor on such Obligations. Without
        limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Domestic Borrower assents
        to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of
        the Agent and the Lenders, including, without limitation, any failure
        strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to
        comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder which might,
        but for the provisions of this Section 6.11, afford grounds for
        terminating, discharging or relieving such Domestic Borrower, in whole
        or in part, from any of its obligations under this Section 6.11, it
        being the intention of each Domestic Borrower that, so long as any of
        the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the obligations of such
        Domestic Borrower under this Section 6.11 shall not be discharged except
        by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The
        Obligations of each Domestic Borrower under this Section 6.11 shall not
        be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up,
        reorganization, amalgamation, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction
        or similar proceeding with respect to any reconstruction or similar
        proceeding with respect to any other Borrower, the Agent or any of the
        Lenders. The joint and several liability of the Domestic Borrowers
        hereunder shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any
        absorption, merger, amalgamation or any other change whatsoever in the
        name, ownership, membership, constitution or place of formation of any
        Borrower or the Lenders. Each of the Domestic Borrowers acknowledges and
        confirms that it has itself established its own adequate means of
        obtaining from each of the other

<PAGE>
                                      -46-


        Borrowers on a continuing basis all information desired by such Domestic
        Borrower concerning the financial condition of each of the other
        Borrowers and that each such Domestic Borrower will look to each of the
        other Borrowers and not to the Agent or any Lender in order for such
        Domestic Borrower to keep adequately informed of changes in each of the
        other Borrowers' respective financial conditions.

                (f) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are made for the benefit
        of the Agent and the Lenders and their respective permitted successors
        and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against
        any or all of the Domestic Borrowers as often as occasion therefore may
        arise and without requirement on the part of the Agent or the Lenders or
        such successor or assign first to marshal any of its or their claims or
        to exercise any of its or their rights against any of the other
        Borrowers or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any
        of the other Borrowers or to resort to any other source or means of
        obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any
        other remedy. The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall remain in effect
        until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise
        fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made
        in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be
        restored or returned by the Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency,
        bankruptcy or reorganization of any of the Borrowers, or otherwise, the
        provisions of this Section 6.11 will forthwith be reinstated in effect,
        as though such payment had not been made.

                (g) Each of the Domestic Borrowers hereby agrees that it will
        not enforce any of its rights of reimbursement, contribution,
        subrogation or the like against the other Borrowers with respect to any
        liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan
        Documents, any payments made by it to any of the Agent or the Lenders
        with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security
        therefore until such time as all of the Obligations have been
        irrevocably paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Domestic Borrower
        may have against any other Borrower with respect to any payments to the
        Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under any other Loan Documents are
        hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment,
        without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations arising
        hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full of the Obligations
        and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership,
        liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws
        of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets,
        whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in
        full before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in
        cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower
        therefore.

                (h) Each of the Domestic Borrowers hereby agrees that the
        payment of any amounts due with respect to the indebtedness owing by any
        Borrower to any Domestic Borrower is hereby subordinated to the prior
        payment in full in cash of the Obligations. Each Domestic Borrower
        hereby agrees that after the occurrence and during the continuance of
        any Default or Event of Default, such Domestic Borrower will not demand,
        sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any indebtedness of any other
        Borrower owing to such Domestic Borrower until the Obligations shall
        have been paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing
        sentence, such Domestic Borrower shall collect, enforce or receive any
        amounts in respect of such indebtedness, such amounts shall be
        collected, enforced and received by such Domestic Borrower as trustee
        for the Agent and be paid over to the Agent for the pro rata accounts of
        the Lenders to be applied to repay the Obligations.

        6.12. CURRENCY MATTERS.

                 6.12.1. CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.


<PAGE>
                                      -47-


                (a) Not later than 1:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the last Business
        Day of each calendar month or upon the request of any Lender (the
        "Calculation Date"), the Agent shall determine the Exchange Rate as of
        such date. The Exchange Rate so determined shall become effective on the
        first Business Day immediately following such determination (a "Reset
        Date") and shall remain effective until the next succeeding Reset Date.

                (b) Not later than 4:00 p.m. (Boston time) on each Reset Date,
        the Agent shall determine the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the Outstanding
        Canadian Loans.

                (c) If, on any Reset Date and on the Revolving Credit Loan
        Maturity Date, the aggregate Outstanding amount (expressed in U.S.
        Dollars) of all Canadian Loans exceeds the Total Canadian Commitment
        (expressed in U.S. Dollars) by more than $100,000, then (i) the Agent
        shall give notice thereof to the Canadian Borrower and the Canadian
        Lenders and (ii) within two (2) Business Days thereafter, the Canadian
        Borrower shall repay or prepay Canadian Loans in accordance with this
        Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount such that, after
        giving effect thereto, the aggregate Outstanding amount (expressed in
        U.S. Dollars) of all Canadian Loans no longer exceeds the Total Canadian
        Commitment (expressed in U.S. Dollars).

                (d) Without limiting subsection Section 6.12.1(c), if, on any
        day prior to the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date, the Outstanding
        Canadian Loans (expressed in U.S. Dollars using the Exchange Rate
        calculated on or around such day) exceed the Total Canadian Commitment
        (expressed in U.S. Dollars using the Exchange Rate calculated on or
        around such day) by five percent (5%) or more, then (i) the Agent shall
        give notice thereof to the Canadian Borrower and the Canadian Lenders
        and (ii) within two (2) Business Days thereafter, the Canadian Borrower
        shall repay or prepay Canadian Loans in accordance with this Credit
        Agreement in an aggregate principal amount such that, after giving
        effect thereto, the Outstanding Canadian Loans (expressed in U.S.
        Dollars) no longer exceed the Total Canadian Commitment (expressed in
        U.S. Dollars). Nothing set forth in this Section 6.12 shall be construed
        to require the Agent to calculate daily compliance under this Section
        6.12 unless expressly requested to do so by a Lender.

                 6.12.2. CURRENCY OF ACCOUNT.

                (a) No payment to the Agent or any Lender (whether under any
        judgment or court order or otherwise) shall discharge the obligation or
        liability in respect of which it was made unless and until the Agent or
        such Lender shall have received payment in full in the currency in which
        such obligation or liability was incurred, and to the extent that the
        amount of any such payment shall, on actual conversion into such
        currency, fall short of such obligation or liability, actual or
        contingent, expressed in that currency, the Domestic Borrowers or, with
        respect to the Canadian Obligations only, the Canadian Borrower, shall
        indemnify and reimburse the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
        with respect to the amount of the shortfall.

                (b) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is
        necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in one currency (the "first
        currency") into any other currency (the "second currency") the
        conversion shall be made at the spot rate of exchange of the Agent (as
        conclusively determined by the Agent absent manifest error) on the
        Business Day preceding the day on which the final judgment is given. If,
        however, on the Business Day following receipt by the Agent in the
        second currency of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder (or any
        proportion thereof) the Agent purchases the first currency with the
        amount


<PAGE>
                                      -48-


        of the second currency so received and the first currency so purchased
        falls short of the sum originally due hereunder in the first currency
        (or the same proportion thereof) the applicable Borrowers, shall, as a
        separate obligation and notwithstanding any judgment, pay to the Agent
        in the first currency an amount equal to such shortfall.

                   7. COLLATERAL SECURITY; COLLATERAL NOTES.

        7.1. SECURITY OF DOMESTIC BORROWERS. The Obligations shall be secured by
(a) a perfected first priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens
entitled to priority under applicable law) in all assets of each Domestic
Borrower, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, pursuant to the terms of the
Domestic Security Documents to which each Domestic Borrower is a party; (b) a
pledge of 100% of the capital stock or other equity interests of the Domestic
Borrowers (other than DBI) to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders pursuant
to the Securities Pledge Agreement to secure the Obligations; and (c) a
first-priority pledge of 66% of the capital stock or other Equity Interests of
the Canadian Borrower to the Agent for the benefit of the Domestic Lenders
pursuant to the Securities Pledge Agreement to secure the Domestic Obligations;
provided that (i) the Mortgage by and among DBI and the other parties thereto
with respect to the Real Estate located at 7025 Salisbury Road, Jacksonville,
Florida shall secure only the Obligations under the Collateral Note referred to
in such Mortgage and (ii) the Mortgage by and among DBI and the other parties
thereto with respect to the Real Estate located at 3000 Oakwood Blvd.,
Hollywood, Florida 33020 shall secure only the Obligations under the Collateral
Note referred to in such Mortgage.

        7.2. SECURITY OF CANADIAN BORROWER. The Canadian Obligations shall be
secured by a perfected first-priority interest (subject to the liens described
on Schedule 10.2, the liens permitted pursuant to Section 10.2(g) and Permitted
Liens entitled to priority under applicable law) in all assets of the Canadian
Borrower whether now owned or hereafter acquired, pursuant to the terms of the
Canadian Security Documents to which the Canadian Borrower is a party. The
Canadian Obligations shall also be guaranteed by the Domestic Borrowers and such
Guaranty shall be secured as provided in Section 7.1 and shall also be secured
by a first-priority pledge of 34% of the capital stock or other Equity Interests
of the Canadian Borrower to the Agent for the benefit of the Canadian Lenders
pursuant to the Securities Pledge Agreement and a second-priority pledge of 66%
of the capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Canadian Borrower to the
Agent for the benefit of the Canadian Lenders pursuant to the Securities Pledge
Agreement.

        7.3. COLLATERAL NOTES. In addition to the Term A Notes, the Revolving
Credit Notes and the Canadian Notes, each of the Borrowers agrees that with
respect to any of the Real Estate to be mortgaged by it or any of its
Subsidiaries hereunder, it will execute and deliver or cause such Subsidiary to
execute and deliver to the Agent such collateral notes (the "Collateral Notes")
in such form as the Agent and the Borrowers may from time to time agree. The
parties hereto hereby agree that (a) the aggregate amount of the Outstanding
Obligations shall not be increased by the issuance of the Collateral Notes and
(b) any payment or recovery on the Collateral Notes shall be applied to the
Obligations pursuant to Section 14.4. All Collateral Notes shall be payable to
the order of the Agent, on demand; provided that the Agent hereby agrees that it
shall not demand payment on any Collateral Note unless the Obligations shall
have become immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 14.1.

                       8. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

        The Borrowers represent and warrant to each of the Lenders and the Agent
as follows:

        8.1. CORPORATE AUTHORITY.

                 8.1.1. INCORPORATION; GOOD STANDING. Each of the Borrowers and
each of their Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or limited partnership duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, (ii) has all requisite corporate or
limited partnership power to own or lease its property as the case may be and
conduct its business as now conducted and as presently contemplated, and (iii)
is in good standing as a foreign corporation or limited partnership and is duly
authorized to do business in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary except where a failure to be so qualified would not have a materially
adverse effect on the business, assets or financial condition of such Borrower
or such Subsidiary.

                 8.1.2. AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which each of the
Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries is or is to become a party and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (i) are within the corporate or
limited partnership authority of such Person, (ii) have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate or limited partnership proceedings, (iii) do not
conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of any provision of law,
statute, rule or regulation to which any of the Borrowers or any of their
Subsidiaries is subject or any judgment, order, writ, injunction, license or
permit applicable to any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries and (iv)
do not conflict with any provision of the corporate charter or bylaws or other
organizational documents of, or any agreement or other instrument binding upon,
any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries.

                 8.1.3. ENFORCEABILITY. The execution and delivery of this
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which any of the Borrowers or
any of their Subsidiaries is or is to become a party will result in valid and
legally binding obligations of such Person enforceable against it in accordance
with the respective terms and provisions hereof and thereof, except as
enforceability is limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors'
rights and except to the extent that availability of the remedy of specific
performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefore may be brought.

        8.2. GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries of this Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents to which each is or is to become a party and the credit
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not require the approval or
consent of, or filing with, any governmental agency or authority other than
those already obtained.

        8.3. TITLE TO PROPERTIES; LEASES. Attached hereto as Schedule 8.3 is a
complete list of Real Estate owned or leased by the Borrowers or any of their
Subsidiaries. The Borrowers and their Subsidiaries own or lease all of the
assets reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of the Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries as at the Balance Sheet Date or acquired since that date (except
property and assets sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business since that date), subject to no rights of others, including any
mortgages, leases, conditional sales agreements, title retention agreements,
liens or other encumbrances except Permitted Liens.

                                      -50-


        8.4. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS.

                 8.4.1. FISCAL YEAR. The Borrowers and their Subsidiaries have a
fiscal year that ends on the Sunday after the Saturday closest to January 31 of
each calendar year. The term "Fiscal Year XXXX", where "XXXX" is a calendar
year, shall refer to the fiscal year of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries
ending during such calendar year.

                 8.4.2. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. There has been furnished to each
of the Lenders (a) a consolidated balance sheet of the Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries as at the Balance Sheet Date, and a consolidated statement of
income of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year then ended,
certified by Ernst & Young LLP, and (b) unaudited balance sheets and statements
of income and cash flow for that portion of the fiscal year ending on August 3,
2003. Such financial statements described in the preceding sentence have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present the financial condition of
the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries as at the close of business on the date
thereof and the results of operations for the fiscal period then ended subject
to year end adjustments in the case of interim statements. There are no
contingent liabilities of any of the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries as of such
date involving material amounts, known to the officers of the Borrowers, which
were not disclosed in such balance sheet and the notes related thereto.

                 8.4.3. PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET AND PROJECTIONS. The Borrowers
have delivered to the Agent a consolidated pro forma balance sheet as of the
Closing Date reflecting the borrowing hereunder on such date, which pro forma
balance sheet has been prepared in good faith on the basis of the assumptions
stated therein. The projections of the annual operating budgets of the Borrowers
and their Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, balance sheets and cash flow
statements for the 2004 to 2007 fiscal years, copies of which have been

any of its Subsidiaries to, become a party to any merger, amalgamation or
consolidation except the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of one or more of

(other than the Canadian Borrower) so long as the Borrowers give the Agent prior
written notice of such transfer and take such steps as the Agent may reasonably
deem necessary to perfect, or preserve the perfection of, the Agent's security
interest in the assets subject to such transfer. Nothing in this Section 10.5.2
is intended to prohibit any Borrower or any of the Borrowers' Subsidiaries from
conditionally agreeing to dispose of any assets subject to the prior approval of
the Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders in the case of the sale of a
material portion of the Collateral) if such Borrower or Subsidiary will not be
subject to any penalties in connection with such agreement in the event that the
Required Lenders do not consent to such disposition. The Agent may release any
Collateral disposed of by any Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower (other
than by transfer to another Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower) if such
disposition is in compliance with this Section 10.5.2 and otherwise with the
terms hereof.

(whether of stock or of substantially all of the assets of a business or
business division as a going concern or by means of a merger or consolidation)
of a 100% interest in any other Person (a "Permitted Acquisition") provided that
all of the following conditions shall have been satisfied: (i) such other Person
shall not be a Borrower and shall operate a similar business to that of the
Borrowers, (ii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and none shall exist after giving effect thereto, (iii) if a Borrower
shall merge or amalgamate with such other Person, such Borrower shall be the
surviving party of such merger or amalgamation, (iv) if such Person shall become
a Subsidiary of any Borrower, such new Subsidiary shall become a Borrower
pursuant to, and take all other actions required by, Section 9.16 hereof, (v)
such Borrower shall have delivered to the Agent Compliance Certificates (such
Compliance Certificates to be distributed to the Lenders by the Agent)
demonstrating, both immediately prior to and immediately after such acquisition,
compliance on a Pro Forma Basis with the covenants set forth in Section 11 of
this Credit Agreement and (vi) the aggregate amount expended by the Borrowers
and their Subsidiaries for all Permitted Acquisitions shall not exceed
$7,500,000. Nothing in this Section 10.5.3 is intended to prohibit any Borrower
or any of the Borrowers' Subsidiaries from conditionally agreeing to any asset

with such agreement in the event that the Required Lenders do not consent to

any real or personal property owned by it in order then or thereafter to lease
such property or lease other property that such Borrower or any Subsidiary of
such Borrower intends to use for substantially the same purpose as the property
being sold or transferred (a "Sale-Leaseback"); provided that, so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result there from, a
Borrower or a Borrower's Subsidiary may enter into a Sale-Leaseback with respect
to Units or a leasehold or fee interest in Real Estate if (a) the terms of the
sale as such are comparable to terms which could be obtained in an arm's-length
sale among unaffiliated parties not involving a Sale-Leaseback transaction and
(b) the terms of the lease as such are comparable to terms which could be
obtained in an arm's-length commercial operating lease among unaffiliated
parties and, provided further that, assuming that such Sale-Leaseback (and any
repayment of Indebtedness in conjunction therewith) had occurred immediately
prior to the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended, no
Default or Event of Default would have occurred under Section 11 after giving
effect to such Sale-Leaseback (such Sale-Leaseback referred to herein as a
"Permitted Sale-Leaseback"). The Agent shall release any


<PAGE>
                                      -69-


Collateral disposed of by such Borrower or any Subsidiary of such Borrower if
such disposition is in compliance with this Section 10.5.2 and otherwise with
the terms hereof.

compliance with applicable Environmental Law, (iii) generate any Hazardous
Substances on any of the Real Estate except in compliance with applicable
Environmental Law, (iv) conduct any activity at any Real Estate or use any Real
Estate in any manner so as to cause a release (i.e. releasing, spilling,
leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping,
leaching, disposing or dumping) or threatened release of Hazardous Substances
on, upon or into the Real Estate except in compliance with applicable
Environmental Law or (v) otherwise conduct any activity at any Real Estate or
use any Real Estate in any manner that would violate any Environmental Law or
bring such Real Estate in violation of any Environmental Law.

        10.8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Neither any Borrower nor any ERISA
Affiliate will engage in any "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code which could result in a
material liability for any of the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries. No Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries shall maintain nor contribute to any Guaranteed
Pension Plan or Multiemployer Plan. No Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall
fail to contribute to any funded Canadian Plan any amount required to be
contributed thereto in accordance with applicable Canadian pension legislation
or the terms of such Canadian Plan resulting in a material liability to such
Canadian Plan; or permit or take any action which would result in the aggregate
going concern unfunded liability or the aggregate solvency deficiency in respect
of all the Canadian Plans which are funded plans, determined pursuant to the
actuarial assumptions and methodology utilized in the most recent actuarial
valuations therefore, to exceed the Canadian Dollar Equivalent of $250,000.

        10.9. CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR. None of the Borrowers will, and none will

other arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing
for rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring
payments to or from any such Affiliate or, to the knowledge of any Borrower, any
corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in which any such Affiliate has
a substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee or partner, on terms
more favorable to such Person than would have been obtainable on an arm's-length
basis in the ordinary course of business.

        10.11. BANK ACCOUNTS. None of the Borrowers will, and none will permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) violate directly or indirectly an Agency Account
Agreement or other bank agency or lock box agreement in favor of the Agent for
the benefit of the Lenders and the Agent with respect to such account or (ii)
deposit into any of the payroll accounts listed on Schedule 8.22 any amounts in
excess of amounts necessary to pay current payroll obligations from such
accounts.

        10.12. FRANCHISES. The Borrowers will not, and will not permit any of
their Subsidiaries to, enter into any franchise agreement pursuant to which such
Borrower or such Subsidiary is prohibited from pledging or otherwise assigning

Obligations.

                    11. FINANCIAL COVENANTS OF THE BORROWERS.

        Each of the Borrowers covenants and agrees that, so long as any Loan,
Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation, Letter of Credit or Note is Outstanding, or any
Lender has any obligation to make any Loans, or the Agent has any obligation to
issue, extend or renew any Letters of Credit, the Borrowers will comply with the
following financial covenants calculated on a Pro Forma Basis with respect to

parte appointment of a receiver or receiver and manager, and, if such amount
shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the
payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of such Lender. No remedy
herein conferred upon any Lender or the Agent or the holder of any Note or
purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation is intended to be exclusive of
any other remedy and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be

                                      -78-



in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing
at law or in equity or by statute or any other provision of law.

        14.4. DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS. In the event that, following
the occurrence or during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the
Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, receives any monies in connection with
the enforcement of any of the Security Documents, or otherwise with respect to
the realization upon any of the Collateral, such monies shall be distributed for
application as follows:

                (a) First, to the payment of, or (as the case may be) the
        reimbursement of the Agent for or in respect of all reasonable costs,
        expenses, disbursements and losses which shall have been incurred or
        sustained by the Agent in connection with the collection of such monies
        by the Agent, for the exercise, protection or enforcement by the Agent
        of all or any of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the
        Agent under this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or
        in respect of the Collateral or in support of any provision of adequate
        indemnity to the Agent against any taxes or liens which by law shall
        have, or may have, priority over the rights of the Agent to such monies;

                (b) Second, to all other Obligations in such order or preference
        as the Required Lenders may determine; provided, however, that (i)
        distributions shall be made (A) pari passu among Obligations with
        respect to the Agent's fee payable pursuant to the Fee Letter and all
        other Obligations and (B) with respect to each type of Obligation owing
        to the Lenders, such as interest, principal, fees and expenses, among
        the Lenders pro rata, and (ii) the Agent may in its discretion make
        proper allowance to take into account any Obligations not then due and
        payable;

                (c) Third, upon payment and satisfaction in full or other
        provisions for payment in full satisfactory to the Lenders and the Agent
        of all of the Obligations, to the payment of any obligations required to
        be paid pursuant to Section 9-608(a)(1)(c) or 9-615(a)(3) of the Uniform
        Commercial Code of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and

                (d) Fourth, the excess, if any, shall be returned to the
        Borrowers or to such other Persons as are entitled thereto.

                                   15. SETOFF.

        Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral, during the continuance of
any Event of Default, (i) any deposits or other sums credited by or due from any
of the Lenders or the Agent to any of the Domestic Borrowers and any securities
or other property of any of the Domestic Borrowers in the possession of such
Lender or the Agent may be applied to or set off by such Lender against the
payment of Obligations and any and all other liabilities, direct, or indirect,
absolute or contingent, due or to become due, now existing or hereafter arising,
of any of the Domestic Borrowers to such Lender and (ii) any deposits or other
sums credited by or due from any of the Canadian Lenders or the Agent to the
Canadian Borrower and any securities or other property of the Canadian Borrower
in the possession of such Canadian Lender or the Agent may be applied to or set
off by such Canadian Lender against the payment of Obligations and any and all
other liabilities, direct, or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to become
due, now existing or hereafter arising, of the Canadian Borrower to such
Canadian Lender. ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE ANY LENDER TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS
OR REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THE OBLIGATIONS,
PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS
OR OTHER PROPERTY OF ANY BORROWER ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVED. Each of the

<PAGE>
                                      -79-



Lenders agrees with each other Lender that (a) if an amount to be set off is to
be applied to Indebtedness of any of the Borrowers to such Lender, other than
Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes held by such Lender or constituting
Reimbursement Obligations owed to such Lender, such amount shall be applied
ratably to such other Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness evidenced by all such
Notes held by such Lender or constituting Reimbursement Obligations owed to such
Lender, and (b) if such Lender shall receive from any of the Borrowers, whether
by voluntary payment, exercise of the right of setoff, counterclaim, cross
action, enforcement of the claim evidenced by the Notes held by, or
Reimbursement Obligations owed to such Lender by proceedings against such
Borrower at law or in equity or by proof thereof in bankruptcy, reorganization,
liquidation, receivership or similar proceedings, or otherwise, and shall retain
and apply to the payment of the Note or Notes held by, or Reimbursement
Obligations owed to such Lender any amount in excess of its ratable portion of
the payments received by all of the Lenders with respect to the Notes held by
all of the Lenders, such Lender will make such disposition and arrangements with
the other Lenders with respect to such excess, either by way of distribution,
pro tanto assignment of claims, subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each
Lender receiving in respect of the Notes held by it or Reimbursement Obligations
owed it, its proportionate payment as contemplated by this Credit Agreement;
provided that if all or any part of such excess payment is thereafter recovered
from such Lender, such disposition and arrangements shall be rescinded and the
amount restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

                                 16. THE AGENT.

        16.1. AUTHORIZATION. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and
authorizes Fleet National Bank to act as the Agent hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents.

                (a) The Agent is authorized to take such action on behalf of
        each of the Lenders and to exercise all such powers as are hereunder and
        under any of the other Loan Documents and any related documents
        delegated to the Agent, together with such powers as are reasonably
        incident thereto including the authority, without the necessity of any
        notice to or further consent of the Lenders, from time to time to take
        any action with respect to any Collateral or the Security Documents
        which may be necessary to perfect, maintain perfected or insure the
        priority of the security interest in and liens upon the Collateral
        granted pursuant to the Security Documents, provided that no duties or
        responsibilities not expressly assumed herein or therein shall be
        implied to have been assumed by the Agent.

                (b) The relationship between the Agent and each of the Lenders
        is that of an independent contractor. The use of the term "Agent" is for
        convenience only and is used to describe, as a form of convention, the
        independent contractual relationship between the Agent and each of the
        Lenders. Nothing contained in this Credit Agreement nor the other Loan
        Documents shall be construed to create an agency, trust or other
        fiduciary relationship between the Agent and any of the Lenders.

                (c) As an independent contractor empowered by the Lenders to
        exercise certain rights and perform certain duties and responsibilities
        hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Agent is nevertheless
        a "representative" of the Lenders, as that term is defined in Article 1
        of the Uniform Commercial Code, for purposes of actions for the benefit
        of the Lenders and the Agent with respect to all collateral security and
        guaranties contemplated by the Loan Documents. Such actions include the
        designation of the Agent as "secured party", "mortgagee" or the like on
        all financing statements and other documents and instruments, whether
        recorded or otherwise, relating to the attachment, perfection, priority
        or enforcement of any security interests, mortgages or deeds of trust in
        collateral security intended to secure the payment or performance of any
        of the Obligations, all for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agent.

                                      -80-




        16.2. EMPLOYEES AND THE AGENT. The Agent may exercise its powers and
execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be entitled to
take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to its
rights and duties under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The
Agent may utilize the services of such Persons as the Agent in its sole
discretion may reasonably determine, and all reasonable fees and expenses of any
such Persons shall be paid by the Borrowers.

        16.3. NO LIABILITY. Neither the Agent, the Documentation Agent nor any
of their respective shareholders, directors, officers or employees nor any other
Person assisting them in their duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall
be liable for any waiver, consent or approval given or any action taken, or
omitted to be taken, in good faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the
other Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible
for the consequences of any oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except
that the Agent, the Documentation Agent or such other Person, as the case may
be, may be liable for losses due to its willful misconduct or gross negligence.

        16.4. NO REPRESENTATIONS.

                 16.4.1. GENERAL. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
execution or validity or enforceability of this Credit Agreement, the Notes, the
Letters of Credit, any of the other Loan Documents or any instrument at any time
constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the Notes, or
for the value of any such collateral security or for the validity,
enforceability or collectability of any such amounts owing with respect to the
Notes, or for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made
herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate or instrument
hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of any Borrower or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or
agreements herein or in any instrument at any time constituting, or intended to
constitute, collateral security for the Notes or to inspect any of the
properties, books or records of any Borrower or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. The Agent shall not be bound to ascertain whether any notice,
consent, waiver or request delivered to it by any Borrower or any holder of any
of the Notes shall have been duly authorized or is true, accurate and complete.
The Agent has not made nor does it now make any representations or warranties,
express or implied, nor does it assume any liability to the Lenders, with
respect to the credit worthiness or financial conditions of any Borrower or any
of their respective Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based
upon such information and documents as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement.

                 16.4.2. CLOSING DOCUMENTATION, ETC. For purposes of determining
compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 12, each Lender that has
executed this Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or
accepted, or to be satisfied with, each document and matter either sent, or made
available, by the Agent or the Arranger to such Lender for consent, approval,
acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or
approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to such Lender, unless an officer of
the Agent or the Arranger active upon the Borrowers' account shall have received
notice from such Lender prior to the Closing Date specifying such Lender's
objection thereto and such objection shall not have been withdrawn by notice to
the Agent or the Arranger to such effect on or prior to the Closing Date.

        16.5. PAYMENTS.

                 16.5.1. PAYMENTS TO AGENT. A payment by any Borrower to the
Agent hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents (and in the case of the
Canadian Borrower, despite the express provisions of Section 6.2.1) for the
account of any Lender shall constitute a payment to such Lender. The Agent
agrees promptly (but in no case later than two Business Days after the receipt
of such payments by the

<PAGE>
                                      -81-




Agent) to distribute to each Lender such Lender's pro rata share of payments
received by the Agent for the account of the Lenders except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or in any of the other Loan Documents.

                 16.5.2. DISTRIBUTION BY AGENT. If in the opinion of the Agent
the distribution of any amount received by it in such capacity hereunder, under
the Notes or under any of the other Loan Documents might involve it in
liability, it may refrain from making distribution until its right to make
distribution shall have been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction.
If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and
distributed by the Agent is to be repaid, each Person to whom any such
distribution shall have been made shall either repay to the Agent its
proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the
same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.

                 16.5.3. DELINQUENT LENDERS. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,
any Lender that fails (i) to make available to the Agent its pro rata share of
any Loan or to purchase any Letter of Credit Participation or (ii) to comply
with the provisions of Section 15 with respect to making dispositions and
arrangements with the other Lenders, where such Lender's share of any payment
received, whether by setoff or otherwise, is in excess of its pro rata share of
such payments due and payable to all of the Lenders, in each case as, when and
to the full extent required by the provisions of this Credit Agreement, shall be
deemed delinquent (a "Delinquent Lender") and shall be deemed a Delinquent
Lender until such time as such delinquency is satisfied. A Delinquent Lender
shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the
Borrowers, whether on account of outstanding Loans, Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations, interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining nondelinquent Lenders
for application to, and reduction of, their respective pro rata shares of all
outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations. The Delinquent Lender
hereby authorizes the Agent to distribute such payments to the nondelinquent
Lenders in proportion to their respective pro rata shares of all outstanding
Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations. A Delinquent Lender shall be deemed
to have satisfied in full a delinquency when and if, as a result of application
of the assigned payments to all outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations of the nondelinquent Lenders, the Lenders' respective pro rata
shares of all outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations have
returned to those in effect immediately prior to such delinquency and without
giving effect to the nonpayment causing such delinquency.

        16.6. HOLDERS OF NOTES. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any
Note or the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation as the absolute
owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have been
furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent
holder, assignee or transferee.

        16.7. INDEMNITY. The Lenders ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold
harmless the Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Arranger and their respective
affiliates from and against any and all claims, actions and suits (whether
groundless or otherwise), losses, damages, costs, expenses (including any
expenses for which the Agent, the Documentation Agent or such affiliate has not
been reimbursed by the Borrowers as required by Section 18), and liabilities of
every nature and character arising out of or related to this Credit Agreement,
the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated
or evidenced hereby or thereby, or the Agent's or Documentation Agent's actions
taken hereunder or thereunder in such capacities as Agent, Documentation Agent
or Arranger except to the extent that any of the same shall be directly caused
by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the indemnified party. Without
limiting the foregoing indemnification of Fleet as Agent, Bank One, NA as
Documentation Agent and Fleet Securities, Inc., the indemnification provided for
in this Section 16.7 shall not include any indemnification of Fleet, or Bank
One, NA solely in their respective capacities as Lenders hereunder.

                                      -82-



        16.8. AGENT AS LENDER. In its individual capacity, Fleet shall have the
same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect to its
Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment and Term A Commitment, as applicable, and
the Loans made by it, and as the holder of any of the Notes, as it would have
were it not also the Agent.

        16.9. RESIGNATION. The Agent may resign at any time by giving sixty (60)
days prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon any
such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor Agent. Unless a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, such successor Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Borrowers. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after
the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent
may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a
financial institution having a rating of not less than A or its equivalent by
Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent
hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation, the provisions of
this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for
its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was acting as Agent.

        16.10. NOTIFICATION OF DEFAULTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT; OTHER NOTICES.
Each Lender hereby agrees that, upon learning of the existence of a Default or
an Event of Default, it shall promptly notify the Agent thereof; provided that a
failure to provide such information shall not result in any liability by such
Lender. The Agent hereby agrees that upon receipt of any notice under this
Section 16.10 it shall promptly notify the other Lenders of the existence of
such Default or Event of Default.

        16.11. DUTIES IN THE CASE OF ENFORCEMENT. In case one of more Events of
Default have occurred and shall be continuing, and whether or not acceleration
of the Obligations shall have occurred, the Agent shall, if (i) so requested by
the Required Lenders and (ii) the Lenders have provided to the Agent such
additional indemnities and assurances against expenses and liabilities as the
Agent may reasonably request, proceed to enforce the provisions of the Security
Documents authorizing the sale or other disposition of all or any part of the
Collateral and exercise all or any such other legal and equitable and other
rights or remedies as it may have in respect of such Collateral. The Required
Lenders may direct the Agent in writing as to the method and the extent of any
such sale or other disposition, the Lenders hereby agreeing ratably to indemnify
and hold the Agent harmless from all liabilities incurred in respect of all
actions taken or omitted in accordance with such directions, provided that the
Agent need not comply with any such direction to the extent that the Agent
reasonably believes the Agent's compliance with such direction to be unlawful or
commercially unreasonable in any applicable jurisdiction.

        16.12. AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

        (a) In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other judicial, administrative or like proceeding or any assignment for the
benefit of creditors relative to any Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, the
Agent and in respect of the Canadian Obligations, the Canadian Lenders (in
either case, irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan, Reimbursement
Obligation or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation shall then be due and payable as
herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrowers) shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such proceeding, under any such assignment or
otherwise:


<PAGE>
                                      -83-


                (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
        principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans,
        Reimbursement Obligations, Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations and all
        other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
        documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims
        of the Lenders and the Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
        compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and
        the Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts
        due the Lenders and the Agent under Sections 2.2, 5.6, 6.1, and 18.1)
        allowed in such proceeding or under any such assignment; and

                (ii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable
        or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

        (b) Any custodian, receiver, receiver and manager, assignee, trustee,
liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding or
under any such assignment is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such
payments to the Agent or in case of Canadian Obligations, any Canadian Lender
and, in the event that the Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, nevertheless to pay to the Agent any amount due for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agent and
its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Agent under Sections 2.2,
5.6, 6.1, and 18.1.

        (c) Nothing contained herein shall authorize the Agent to consent to or
accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations owed to such Lender or the
rights of any Lender or authorize the Agent to vote in respect of the claim of
any Lender in any such proceeding or under any such assignment.

               17. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

        17.1. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Lenders and the Agent agrees, on
behalf of itself and each of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and
representatives, to use reasonable precautions to keep confidential, in
accordance with their customary procedures for handling confidential information
of the same nature and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices, any
non-public information supplied to it by any of the Borrowers or their
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Credit Agreement that is identified by such Person
as being confidential at the time the same is delivered to the Lenders or the
Agent, provided that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any such
information (a) after such information shall have become public other than
through a violation of this Section 17, or becomes available to any of the
Lenders or the Agent on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the
Borrowers, (b) to the extent required by statute, rule, regulation or judicial
process, (c) to counsel, accountants or other professionals or agents acting on
behalf of any of the Lenders or the Agent, (d) to bank examiners or any other
regulatory authority having jurisdiction over any Lender or the Agent, or to
auditors or accountants, (e) to the Agent, any Lender or any Financial
Affiliate, (f) in connection with any litigation involving the Borrowers or any
of their Subsidiaries and the Lenders, the Agent or any Financial Affiliate, or
in connection with the enforcement of rights or remedies hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, (g) to a Subsidiary or affiliate of such Lender or to other
affiliates in the ordinary course of such Lender's business, provided that such
other affiliates are not engaged in or investors in restaurant businesses
competing with the Borrowers, (h) to any assignee or participant (or prospective
assignee or participant) so long as such assignee or participant agrees to be
bound by the provisions of Section 17 or (i) with the consent of the Borrowers.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Agent and each Lender may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, any information
with respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to the Agent or such Lender relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure;

<PAGE>
                                      -84-



provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in either case
contains information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the
transaction as well as other information, this sentence shall only apply to such
portions of the document or similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax
structure of the Loans, Letters of Credit and transactions contemplated hereby.

        17.2. PRIOR NOTIFICATION. Unless specifically prohibited by applicable
law or court order, each of the Lenders and the Agent shall, prior to disclosure
thereof, notify the Borrowers of any request for disclosure of any such
non-public information by any governmental agency or representative thereof
(other than any such request in connection with an examination of the financial
condition of such Lender by such governmental agency) or pursuant to legal
process.

        17.3. OTHER. In no event shall any Lender or the Agent be obligated or
required to return any materials furnished to it or any Financial Affiliate by
any of the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries. The obligations of each Lender under
this Section 17 shall supersede and replace the obligations of such Lender under
any confidentiality letter in respect of this financing signed and delivered by
such Lender to any of the Borrowers prior to the date hereof and shall be
binding upon any assignee of, or purchaser of any participation in, any interest
in any of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations from any Lender.

                        18. EXPENSES AND INDEMNIFICATION.

        18.1. EXPENSES. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay (i) the

of the proceeds of any of the Loans or Letters of Credit, (ii) the reversal or
withdrawal of any provisional credits granted by the Agent upon the transfer of
funds from lock box, bank agency or concentration accounts or in connection with
the provisional honoring of checks or other items, (iii) any actual or alleged
infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark, service mark or similar right
of any of the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries comprised in the Collateral, (iv)
any of the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries entering into or performing this
Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or (v) with respect to each
of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and their respective properties and
assets, the violation of any Environmental Law, the presence, disposal, escape,
seepage, leakage, spillage, discharge, emission, release or threatened release
of any Hazardous Substances or any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
brought or threatened with respect to any Hazardous Substances (including, but
not limited to, claims with respect to wrongful death, personal injury or damage
to property), in each case including, without limitation, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel incurred in
connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding. In
litigation, or the preparation therefore, the Lenders, the Agent, the Arranger
and the affiliates of the Agent and the Arranger shall be entitled to select
their own counsel and, in addition to the foregoing indemnity, the Borrowers
jointly and severally agree to pay promptly the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel. EACH BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS
PROVISIONS RELEASING EACH INDEMNITEE FROM LIABILITY AND/OR INDEMNIFYING AND
HOLDING HARMLESS EACH INDEMNITEE FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INDEMNITEE'S OWN
NEGLIGENCE. EACH BORROWER AGREES THAT THE RELEASE AND/OR INDEMNITY PROVISIONS
CONTAINED IN THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE CAPTIONED TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE RELEASE
AND/OR INDEMNITY PROVISIONS AND, THEREFORE, ARE SO CONSPICUOUS THAT SUCH
BORROWER HAS FAIR NOTICE OF THE EXISTENCE AND CONTENTS OF SUCH PROVISIONS. EACH
BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES ANY DEFENSES IT MIGHT ASSERT AGAINST EACH INDEMNITEE

THE FIFTH CIRCUIT IN QUORUM HEALTH RESOURCES, L.L.C. v. MAVERICK COUNTY HOSPITAL
DISTRICT, 308 F.3d 451 (5TH CIR. 2002) AND ANY RELATED CASE LAW HOLDINGS. If,
and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrowers under this Section 18.2
are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrowers hereby jointly and severally
agree to make the maximum contribution to the payment in satisfaction of such
obligations which is permissible under applicable law.

        18.3. SURVIVAL. The covenants contained in this Section 18 shall survive
payment or satisfaction in full of all other Obligations.

                         19. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, ETC.

        All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made herein,
in the Notes, in any of the other Loan Documents or in any documents or other
papers delivered by or on behalf of any of the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries
pursuant hereto shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the Lenders and the
Agent, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by any of
them, and shall survive the making by the Lenders of any of the Loans and the
issuance, extension or renewal of any Letters of Credit, as herein contemplated,
and shall continue in full force and effect so long as any Letter of Credit or
any amount due under this Credit Agreement or the Notes or any of the other Loan
Documents remains outstanding or any Lender has any obligation to make any Loans
or the Agent has any obligation to issue, extend or renew any Letter of Credit,
and for such further time as may be otherwise expressly specified in this Credit
Agreement. All statements contained in any certificate or other paper delivered
to any Lender or the Agent at any time by or on behalf of any of the Borrowers
or

                                      -86-


their Subsidiaries pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall constitute representations and warranties by such
Borrower or such Subsidiary hereunder.

                        20. ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATION.

        20.1. GENERAL CONDITIONS. The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrowers

the provisions of Section 20.2, (b) by way of participation in accordance with
the provisions of Section 20.5 or (c) by way of pledge or assignment of a
security interest subject to the restrictions of Section 20.7 (and any other

Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in
Section 20.5 and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related
Parties of each of the Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Credit Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents.

        20.2. ASSIGNMENTS. Any (a) Domestic Lender may at any time assign to one
or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of (i) its Domestic Revolving
Credit Commitment Percentage and Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment and the
same portion of the Domestic Revolving Credit Loans at the time owing to it, the
Domestic Revolving Credit Notes held by it and its participating interest in the
risk relating to any Letters of Credit, and (ii) its Term A Commitment
Percentage and Term A Commitment and the same portion of Term Loan A at the time
owing to it and the Term A Note held by it) and (b) Canadian Lender may at any
time assign all or a portion of its Canadian Commitment Percentage and Canadian
Loans outstanding to an Eligible Canadian Assignee; provided that in each case
referred to above:

               (a) except in the cases of an assignment of the entire remaining
        amount of the assigning Lender's Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment,
        Term A Commitment, Canadian Commitment and the Loans at the time owing
        to it or of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, the
        aggregate amount of the Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment (which for
        this purpose includes Revolving Credit Loans outstanding thereunder),
        Canadian Commitment (which for this purpose includes Canadian Loans
        outstanding thereunder) Term A Commitment, or, if the applicable
        Revolving Credit Commitment is not then in effect, the principal
        outstanding balance of the applicable Revolving Credit Loans of the
        assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the
        date on which the Assignment and Acceptance, with respect to such
        assignment is delivered to the Agent) shall not be less than $2,500,000
        unless each of the Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default
        has occurred and is continuing, each of the Borrowers otherwise consent
        (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

               (b) each such assignment shall be in constant, and not varying,
        percentages of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in
        respect of each of the following, considered separately: (i) its
        Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage and Domestic Revolving
        Credit Commitment, the Domestic Revolving Credit Loans at the time owing
        to it, and its participating interest in the risk relating to any

<PAGE>
                                      -87-


               (c) any assignment of a Revolving Credit Commitment must be
        approved by the Agent unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is
        itself a Lender with a Revolving Credit Commitment (whether or not the
        proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee or an
        Eligible Canadian Assignee); and

               (d) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
        the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and
        recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee or Eligible
        Canadian Assignee, as the case may be, if it shall not be a Lender,
        shall deliver to the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

        Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to
        Section 20.3, from and after the effective date specified in each
        Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee or Eligible Canadian
        Assignee, as the case may be, thereunder shall be a party to this Credit
        Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
        and Acceptance have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
        Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the
        extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be
        released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the
        case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning
        Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender
        shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to
        the benefits of (i) Sections 6.2.2, 6.6, 6.7, and 6.9 with respect to
        facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
        assignment and (ii) Section 18.2 notwithstanding such assignment. Any
        assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
        Credit Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be
        treated for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a sale by such Lender
        of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
        Section 20.5.

        20.3. REGISTER. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment
and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lenders, the Revolving Credit Commitments and Term A
Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and each of the Borrowers, the Agent and the
Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to
the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

        20.4. NEW NOTES. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by the parties to such assignment, together with each Note subject to
such assignment, the Agent shall (a) record the information contained therein in
the Register, and (b) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers and the
Lenders (other than the assigning Lender). Within five (5) Business Days after
receipt of such notice, the Borrowers, at their own expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Agent, in exchange for each surrendered Note, a new Note to the
order of such Eligible Assignee or if requested, Eligible Canadian Assignee, as
the case may be, in an amount equal to the amount assumed by such Eligible
Assignee or Eligible Canadian Assignee, as the case may be, pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained some portion
of its obligations hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Lender in
an amount equal to the amount retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall
provide that they are replacements for the surrendered Notes, shall be in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the
surrendered Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and
Acceptance and shall otherwise be substantially the form of the assigned Notes.
Within five (5) days of issuance of any new Notes pursuant to this Section 20.4,
upon the request of the holders of such New Notes the Borrowers shall deliver an
opinion of counsel, addressed to the Lenders and the Agent, relating to the due
authorization, execution and delivery of such new Notes and the legality,
validity and


<PAGE>
                                      -88-


binding effect thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to the Lenders. The
surrendered Notes shall be cancelled and returned to the Borrowers.

        20.5. PARTICIPATIONS. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the Borrowers or the Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of
such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including
all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, Term A Commitment and/or
the Loans owing to it; provided however, that a Lender may sell participations
in all or a portion of its Canadian Commitment Percentage and Canadian Loans
outstanding, only to an Eligible Canadian Assignee); provided further that (a)
such Lender's obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(b) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
the performance of such obligations and (c) the Borrowers, the Agent and the
other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided that such agreement
or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that would reduce
the principal of or the interest rate on any Loans, extend the term or increase
the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment or Term A Commitment of such
Lender as it relates to such Participant, reduce the amount of any Commitment
Fees or Letter of Credit Fees to which such Participant is entitled or extend
any regularly scheduled payment date for principal or interest. Subject to
Section 20.6, each of the Borrowers agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 6.2.2, 6.6, 6.7, and 6.9 to the same extent
as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
Section 20.2. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 15 as though it were a Lender, provided such
Participant agrees to be subject to Section 15 as though it were a Lender.

        20.6. PAYMENTS TO PARTICIPANTS. A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Sections 6.2.2, 6.6 and 6.7 than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the Borrowers' prior written consent.

        20.7. MISCELLANEOUS ASSIGNMENT PROVISIONS. A Lender may at any time
grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation (a)
any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to the Bank of Canada or any of
the twelve Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal
Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341 and (b) with respect to any Lender that is an
Approved Fund, to any lender or any trustee for, or any other representative of,
holders of obligations owed or securities issued by such Approved Fund as
security for such obligations or securities or any institutional custodian for
such Approved Fund or for such lender; provided that no such grant shall release
such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder, provide any voting rights
hereunder to the secured party thereof, substitute any such secured party for
such Lender as a party hereto or affect any rights or obligations of the
Borrowers or Agent hereunder.

        20.8. ASSIGNEE OR PARTICIPANT AFFILIATED WITH THE BORROWERS. If any
assignee Lender is an Affiliate of any Borrower, then any such assignee Lender
shall have no right to vote as a Lender hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents for purposes of granting consents or waivers or for purposes of
agreeing to amendments or other modifications to any of the Loan Documents or
for purposes of making requests to the Agent pursuant to Section 14.1 or Section
14.2, and the determination of the Required Lenders shall for all purposes of
this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents be made without regard to
such assignee Lender's interest in any of the Loans or Reimbursement
Obligations. If any Lender sells a participating interest in any of the Loans or
Reimbursement Obligations to a participant,


<PAGE>
                                      -89-


and such participant is a Borrower or an Affiliate of any Borrower, then such
transferor Lender shall promptly notify the Agent of the sale of such
participation. A transferor Lender shall have no right to vote as a Lender
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents for purposes of granting
consents or waivers or for purposes of agreeing to amendments or modifications
to any of the Loan Documents or for purposes of making requests to the Agent
pursuant to Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 to the extent that such participation
is beneficially owned by a Borrower or any Affiliate of any Borrower, and the
determination of the Required Lenders shall for all purposes of this Credit
Agreement and the other Loan Documents be made without regard to the interest of
such transferor Lender in the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations to the extent
of such participation. The provisions of this Section 20.8 shall not apply to an
assignee Lender or participant which has disclosed to the other Lenders that it
is an Affiliate of any Borrower and which, following such disclosure, has been
excepted from the provisions of this Section 20.8 in a writing signed by the
Required Lenders determined without regard to the interest of such assignee
Lender or transferor Lender, to the extent of such participation, in Loans or
Reimbursement Obligations.

        20.9. SYNDICATION. Each of the Borrowers hereby agrees to assist and
cooperate with the Arranger in its efforts to complete the syndication of the
commitments and Loans hereunder, including, but not limited to, promptly
preparing and providing materials and information reasonably deemed necessary by
the Arranger to successfully complete and otherwise facilitate such syndication,
including, without limitation, all projections prepared by or on behalf of the
Borrowers relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
Borrowers and its directors, officers, employees and agents shall, at the
reasonable request of the Arranger, meet with potential lenders and provide such
additional information as such Persons may reasonably request.

        20.10. LENDER MERGER ETC. Nothing herein shall be deemed to restrict the
merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Lender into any Eligible Assignee
or Eligible Canadian Assignee, as the case may be, and nothing herein shall be
deemed to require that an Assignment and Acceptance or any other consent need be
executed with respect to such merger.

        20.11. SPECIAL PURPOSE FUNDING VEHICLE. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 20, any Domestic Lender (a "Granting Lender")
may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC") of such Granting
Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time delivered by the
Granting Lender to the Agent and the Borrowers, the option to provide to the
Borrowers all or any part of any Domestic Loan that such Granting Lender would
otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to this Credit
Agreement, provided that (a) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to
make any Domestic Loan by any SPC, (b) the Granting Lender's obligations under
this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged, (c) the Granting Lender should
retain the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement and
(d) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide
all or any part of such Domestic Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to
make such Domestic Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an
SPC hereunder shall utilize the Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment or Term A
Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Domestic
Loan were made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no
SPC shall be liable for any expense reimbursement, indemnity or similar payment
obligation under this Credit Agreement (all liability for which shall remain
with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Credit
Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the later
of (i) the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC and
(ii) the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date, or, as applicable, the Term Loan A
Maturity Date, it will not institute against, or join any other person in
instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of
the United States of America or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 20.11, any SPC may (A) with
notice to, but


<PAGE>
                                      -90-


(except as specified below) without the prior written consent of, the Borrowers
or the Agent and without paying any processing fee therefore, assign all or a
portion of its interests in any Domestic Loans to its Granting Lender or to any
financial institutions (consented to by the Agent and, so long as no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrowers, which consents
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) providing liquidity and/or credit
facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the Domestic Loans made by
such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued by such SPC to fund such
Domestic Loans and (B) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
information relating to its Domestic Loans (other than financial statements
referred to in Sections 8.4 or 9.4) to any rating agency, commercial paper
dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to
such SPC. In no event shall the Borrowers be obligated to pay to an SPC that has
made a Domestic Loan any greater amount than the Borrowers would have been
obligated to pay under this Credit Agreement if the Granting Lender had made
such Domestic Loan. An amendment to this Section 20.11 without the written
consent of an SPC shall be ineffective insofar as it alters the rights and
obligations of such SPC.

                                21. NOTICES, ETC.

        21.1. NOTICES GENERALLY. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this

approved by the Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to
any Lender pursuant to Sections 2.6, 3.1 and 5.1 if such Lender, as applicable,
has notified the Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under Sections
2.6, 3.1 and 5.1 by electronic communication. The Agent or each of the Borrowers

provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices
or communications. Unless the Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other

requested" function, as available, return e-mail or other written

deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in
the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is

        Each of the Borrowers hereby waives its right to a jury trial with

obligations. Except as prohibited by law, each of the Borrowers hereby waives
any right it may have to claim or recover in any litigation referred to in the

any damages other than, or in addition to, actual damages. Each of the Borrowers
(i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any Lender or the
Agent has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such Lender or the Agent
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers and
(ii) acknowledges that the Agent and the Lenders have been induced to enter into
this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents to which it is a party by, among
other things, the waivers and certifications contained herein.

                     27. CONSENTS, AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC.

        Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement and the
Fee Letter, any consent or approval required or permitted by this Credit
Agreement to be given by the Lenders may be given, and any term of this Credit
Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other instrument related hereto or
mentioned herein may be amended, and the performance or observance by any of the
Borrowers or their Subsidiaries of any terms of this Credit Agreement, the other
Loan Documents or such other instrument or the continuance of any Default or
Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and
either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent
of the Borrowers and the written consent of the Required Lenders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, modification or waiver shall:

        (a)  without the written consent of the Borrowers and each Lender
directly affected thereby:

               (i) decrease the rate of interest on the Notes (other than
        interest accruing pursuant to Section 6.10.2 following the effective
        date of any waiver by the Required Lenders of the Default or Event of
        Default relating thereto);

               (ii) release a material portion of the Collateral;

               (iii) release any Borrower or any Person that is liable, whether
        directly or contingently, for payment obligations hereunder;

               (iv) change or modify the term of the Notes, the timing or amount
        of any required payments of principal and interest hereunder, any rates
        of interest payable hereunder, the application of proceeds from any
        mandatory prepayment of the Term Loan A, or the amount of the Revolving
        Credit Commitments (other than reallocations between the Canadian
        Commitment and the Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment permitted under
        Section 2.3.2) and the Term A Commitments of the Lenders;

               (v) amend or waive the amount of Commitment Fees or Letter of
        Credit Fees hereunder;

        (b)  without the written consent of all of the Lenders:

               (i)  amend or waive the definition of Required Lenders or this
        Section 27;

        (c)  without the written consent of the Agent:


<PAGE>
                                      -93-


               (i) amend or waive the amount of the Agent's fee under the Fee
        Letter, the Letter of Credit Fees, the Fronting Fees or any other fees
        or amounts payable for the Agent's account;

               (ii)  amend or waive Section 5 or Section 16 hereof.

No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or
impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing or delay or omission
on the part of the Agent or any Lender in exercising any right shall operate as
a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto. No notice to or demand
upon any Borrower shall entitle any Borrower to other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 27 to the contrary, the Agent may terminate its security interest in and
otherwise release any Collateral or any Borrower sold, transferred or otherwise
disposed of by any Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower if such
disposition is in compliance with Section 10.5.2 and otherwise with the terms
hereof.

                                28. SEVERABILITY.

        The provisions of this Credit Agreement are severable and if any one
clause or provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in
part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability shall affect
only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction, and shall
not in any manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or
any other clause or provision of this Credit Agreement in any jurisdiction.

                             29. RIGHT TO PUBLICIZE.

        Each of the Borrowers hereby acknowledges that the Agent will have the
right to publicize the transactions contemplated hereby by means of a tombstone
advertisement or other customary advertisement in newspapers and other
periodicals and, for such purpose, the Agent may utilize any trade name,
trademark, logo or other distinctive symbol associated with any of the Borrowers
or their Subsidiaries or any of their businesses. Each of the Agent agrees to
provide the Borrowers with the opportunity to review any such tombstone
advertisement prior to publication thereof and to provide reasonable comments as
to the accuracy and contents thereof.

                                   30. USURY.

        All agreements between the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders are
hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether
by reason of acceleration of the maturity of any Note or otherwise, shall the
amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders and the Agent for the use or the
forbearance of the Indebtedness represented by the Notes exceed the maximum
permissible under applicable law, including, without limitation, the Criminal
Code (Canada). In this regard, it is expressly agreed that it is the intent of
the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders, in the execution, delivery and
acceptance of the Notes, to contract in strict compliance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. If, under any circumstances whatsoever,
performance or fulfillment of any provision of the Notes or any of the other
Loan Documents at the time such provision is to be performed or fulfilled shall
involve exceeding the limit of validity prescribed by applicable law, then the
obligation so to be performed or fulfilled shall be reduced automatically to the
limits of such validity, and if under any circumstances whatsoever the Lenders
and the Agent should ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the
highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be
applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced by the Notes and not
to the payment of interest. The provisions of this Section 30 shall control
every other provision of this Credit Agreement and the Notes.

                            31. DOCUMENTATION AGENT.

        The Documentation Agent shall have no rights, powers, duties,
obligations, liabilities or responsibilities under this Credit Agreement or any
other of the Loan Documents other than these applicable to all Lenders as such.
It is acknowledged by all parties to this Credit Agreement that the title of
"Documentation Agent" is merely for convenience and does not carry with it any
duties, obligations, responsibilities or liabilities arising with respect to the
form or sufficiency of the Loan Documents or otherwise. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Documentation Agent shall not have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship to any Lender or any other party to the Loan Documents.

                         32. TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.

        32.1. FORMER CREDIT AGREEMENT SUPERSEDED. On the Closing Date, this
Credit Agreement shall supersede the Former Credit Agreement in its entirety,
except as provided in this Section 32. On the Closing Date, the rights and
obligations of the parties evidenced by the Former Credit Agreement shall be
evidenced by the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the "Loans" as
defined in the Former Credit Agreement shall be converted to Loans as defined
herein and the Existing Letters of Credit issued by the Agent for the account of
the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date shall be
converted into Letters of Credit under this Credit Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that the changes to the terms and conditions of the Former Credit
Agreement set out herein and the execution of these presents shall not
constitute novation and all the security interests, hypothecs, pledges and other
collateral of whatever nature securing any of the Obligations shall continue to
apply to the Former Credit Agreement, as amended and restated by these presents,
and to the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and to the extent necessary, the Lenders and the Agent reserve all of
their rights under each of the Security Documents.

        32.2. RETURN AND CANCELLATION OF PRIOR NOTES. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, the Lenders under the Former Credit
Agreement will promptly return to the Borrowers, marked "Substituted" or
"Cancelled", as the case may be, any notes held by the Lenders pursuant to the
Former Credit Agreement.

        32.3. INTEREST AND FEES UNDER SUPERSEDED AGREEMENT. All interest and
fees and expenses, if any, owing or accruing under or in respect of the Former
Credit Agreement through the Closing Date shall be calculated as of the Closing
Date (pro rated in the case of any fractional periods), and shall be paid on the
Closing Date. Commencing on the Closing Date, the Commitment Fees hereunder
shall be payable by the Borrowers to the Agent for the account of the Lenders in
accordance with Section 2.2.

                            33. PARI PASSU TREATMENT.

        (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each
payment or prepayment of principal and interest received after the occurrence of
an Event of Default hereunder shall be distributed pari passu among the Lenders,
in accordance with the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Obligations
owing to each Lender divided by the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
all Obligations.

        (b) Following the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender agrees that it shall be deemed to have automatically upon
the occurrence of such Event of Default purchased from each other Lender a
participation in the risk associated with the Notes and Obligations held by such
other Lender, so that the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and


<PAGE>
                                      -95-


Obligations held by each Lender shall be equivalent to such Lender's Applicable
Percentage (without duplication in the case of any Canadian Lender and its
affiliated Domestic Lender, whose Notes and Obligations shall be taken as a
whole). Upon demand by the Agent, made at the request of the Required Lenders,
each Lender that has purchased such participation (a "Purchasing Lender") shall
pay the amount of such participation to the Agent for the account of each Lender
whose outstanding Loans exceed their Applicable Percentages (without duplication
in the case of any Canadian Lender and its affiliated Domestic Lender, whose
Notes and Obligations shall be taken as a whole). Any such participation may, at
the option of such Purchasing Lender, be paid in U.S. Dollars or Canadian
Dollars (the "Funding Currency") (in an amount equal to the then applicable
Dollar Equivalent or Canadian Dollar Equivalent, as the case may be, amount of
such participation) and such payment shall be converted by the Agent at the
Exchange Rate calculated on or around such day into the currency of the Loan in
which such participation is being purchased. The Borrowers agree to indemnify
each Purchasing Lender for any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Purchasing
Lender as a result of entering into any reasonable hedging arrangements between
the Funding Currency and the currency of the Loan in which such participation is
being purchased in connection with the funding of such participation or as a
result of any payment on account of such participation in a currency other than
that funded by the Purchasing Lender.

        (c) Each Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and
agrees that any Person holding such a participation in the Notes, Loans and the
Obligations deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of
banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing
by such Borrower to such Person as fully as if such Person had made a Loan
directly to such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

        (d) Nothing contained in this Section 33 shall impair, as between the
Borrowers and any Lender, the obligation of the applicable Borrowers to pay such
Lender all amounts payable in respect of such Lender's Notes, Loans, and other
Obligations as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with
the terms thereof.
