Each Commitment Party and Mandated Lead  Arranger may, subject to Section 8, employ the services of its respective affiliates in providing certain  services hereunder and, in connection with the provision of such services, but subject to Section 5 above,  may exchange with such affiliates information concerning you and the other companies that may be the  subject of the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, and, to the extent  so employed, such affiliates shall be entitled to the benefits, and be subject to the obligations, of the  applicable Commitment Party or Mandated Lead Arranger hereunder.

You also hereby  acknowledge that (a) pursuant to the services provided herein, the Commitment Parties and the Mandated  Lead Arrangers have not advised and are not advising you as to any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax  matters or any other matters in any jurisdiction, and that you are consulting your own advisors concerning  such matters to the extent you deem it appropriate and (b) you are capable of evaluating, and understand  and accept, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby.         You understand that the Commitment Parties, the Mandated Lead Arrangers, and their respective  affiliates (collectively, the &#8220;Group&#8221;) are full service securities or banking firms and are engaged in  securities trading and brokerage activities as well as providing a wide range of investment banking and  other financial services and businesses (including investment management, financing, securities trading,  corporate and investment banking and research).  Members of the Group and businesses within the Group  generally act independently of each other, both for their own account and for the account of clients.   Accordingly, there may be situations where parts of the Group and/or their clients either now have or may  in the future have interests, or take actions, that may conflict with your interests.  For example, the Group  may, in the ordinary course of business, engage in trading in financial products or undertake other  investment businesses for their own account or on behalf of other clients, including without limitation,  trading in or holding long, short or derivative positions in securities, loans or other financial products of  you or your affiliates or other entities connected with the Credit Facilities or the transactions contemplated  hereby.  With respect to any securities and/or financial instruments so held by any Commitment Party, any  Mandated Lead Arranger, or any of its or their respective customers, all rights in respect of such securities  and financial instruments, including any voting rights, will be exercised by the holder of the rights, in its  sole discretion.         In recognition of the foregoing, you agree that the Group is not required to restrict its activities as  a result of this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter and that the Group may undertake any business  activity without further consultation with or notification to you.  Neither this Commitment Letter, the Fee  Letter, nor the receipt by the Commitment Parties or the Mandated Lead Arrangers of confidential  information nor any other matter will give rise to any fiduciary, equitable or contractual duties (including  without limitation, any duty of trust or confidence) that would prevent or restrict the Group from acting on  behalf of other customers or for its own account.  Furthermore, you agree that neither the Group nor any  member or business of the Group is under a duty to disclose to you or use on your behalf any information  whatsoever about or derived from those activities or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in  connection with such activities.  However, consistent with the Group&#8217;s long-standing policy to hold in  confidence the affairs of its customers, the Group will not use confidential information obtained from you  except in connection with its services to, and its relationship with, you, provided, however, that the Group  will be free to disclose information upon reasonable advance notice to you (to the extent practicable and  permissible) in any manner as required by law, regulation, regulatory authority or other applicable judicial  or government order.         In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby acknowledges that the Commitment  Parties, the Mandated Lead Arrangers, or their respective affiliates, (i) may provide debt financing, equity  capital or other services to other persons with whom the Company or its affiliates may have conflicting  interests in respect of the Credit Facilities in this or other transactions, and (ii) may act in more than one  capacity in relation to the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and  may have conflicting interests in respect of such different capacities. The Company acknowledges (on  behalf of itself and its affiliates) that the Commitment Parties and the Mandated Lead Arrangers have no  obligation to use any information obtained from another source for purposes of the Credit Facilities or  otherwise in connection with its obligations under this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, or to furnish  such information to the Company or its affiliates.                                                                                           13    </FONT></DIV>

Assignments         The Company may not assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Commitment  Letter without the prior written consent of each Mandated Lead Arranger and each Commitment Party, and  any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void ab initio.  The Commitment Parties and the  Mandated Lead Arrangers may not assign or delegate any of their rights, commitments with respect to the  Credit Facilities or other obligations under this Commitment Letter, as applicable, without the Company&#8217;s  prior written consent or except (i) to its affiliates, (ii) as provided in Section 2 hereof or (iii) on or after the  Closing Date, as provided in the section titled &#8220;Transfers and Assignments&#8221; in each Term Sheet, and any  attempted assignment without such consent (to the extent required in accordance with this Commitment  Letter) shall be void ab initio.

Each of the parties hereto agrees that the Fee Letter is a binding and enforceable  agreement with respect to the subject matter contained therein.

Taxes:              Novelis expects the initial Lenders to book the loans in jurisdictions with, or in a                      manner giving rise to, zero U.S. federal withholding tax, unless, as a result of a                      change  in  law  after  the  date  the  applicable  Lender  provided  a  binding                      commitment to fund the Short Term Loan, booking the loans in jurisdictions with,                      or  in  a  manner  giving  rise  to,  zero  U.S.  federal  withholding  tax  would,  in  the                      Lender&#8217;s  reasonable  judgment,  subject  such  Lender  to  any  material                      unreimbursed  cost  or  expense  or  would  materially  prejudice  the legal  or                      commercial position of such Lender.                                             The terms of the Short Term Loan will contain gross-up provisions for withholding                      taxes solely to the extent such withholding taxes are applicable to changes in law                      following  the  earlier  of  (1)  the  date  applicable  Lender  provided  a  binding                      commitment to a member of the Novelis Group to fund the Short Term Loans and                      (2) the date the applicable Lender acquired its interest in the  Short  Term  Loan                      (including  an  acquisition  of  an  interest  in  the  Short  Term  Loan  pursuant  to  an                      assignment). In addition to the gross-up set forth in the preceding sentence for                      changes in law after the date of an assignment, in the case of an assignment of                      the Short Term Loan, an assignee Lender shall also be entitled to a gross-up for                      withholding taxes to the extent such Lender&#8217;s assignor was entitled to a gross-up                      for withholding taxes immediately prior to the assignment; provided that, for the                      avoidance  of  doubt,  no  assignee  shall  be  entitled  to  any  such  gross-up  for                      withholding taxes in excess of the  withholding taxes to which such assignee is                      subject.                                            Novelis&#8217;s  obligation  to  provide any  gross-up  for  U.S.  federal  withholding  taxes                      shall  be  subject  to  the  applicable  lender  providing  U.S.  federal  tax  forms                      customarily  required  to  be  delivered  by  lenders  pursuant  to  U.S.  loan                      agreements,  including  applicable  Forms  W-8  or  W-9,  which  would reduce  or                      eliminate  U.S.  federal  withholding  tax,  to  the  extent  the  applicable  lender  is                      legally entitled to provide such forms. Novelis&#8217;s obligation to provide any gross-                     up  for  non-U.S.  withholding  taxes  shall  be  subject  to  the  applicable  lender                      providing  non-U.S.  tax  forms  reasonably  requested  by  Novelis  which  would                      reduce  or  eliminate  non-U.S.  withholding  tax,  provided,  however,  that  the                      submission  of  such  non-U.S.  tax  forms  shall  not  be  required  if in  the  lender&#8217;s                      reasonable judgment the completion, execution or submission of any such forms                      would  subject  such  lender  to  any  material  unreimbursed  cost  or expense  or                      would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such lender.                                            In  the  event  Novelis  is  required  to  pay  any  withholding  taxes  with  respect  to                      interest and fees with respect to Short Term Loans held by any Lender and such                      Lender  is  not  grossed-up  for  such taxes  pursuant  to  the  provisions  described                      herein, Novelis will provide such Lender with a certificate confirming the amount                      of such withholding taxes paid.
