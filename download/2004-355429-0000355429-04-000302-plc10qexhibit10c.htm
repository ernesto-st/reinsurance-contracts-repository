commitment fees, late charges and loan charges, shall be limited to the Maximum Lawful
Amount. Such charges hereunder shall be characterized and all provisions of the Credit
Documents shall be construed as to uphold the validity of charges provided for therein to
the fullest possible extent. Additionally, all charges hereunder shall be spread over the

thereof to the fullest possible extent, without regard to prepayment of or the right to
prepay the Obligations. If for any reason whatsoever, however, any charges paid or
contracted to be paid in respect of the Obligations shall exceed the Maximum Lawful
Amount, then, without any specific action by Lenders, Agent or the Borrowers, the
obligation to pay such interest and/or other charges shall be reduced to the Maximum
Lawful Amount in effect from time to time and any amounts collected by Lenders that exceed
the Maximum Lawful Amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of
the Obligations and/or refunded to the Borrowers so that at no time shall the interest or
loan charges paid or payable in respect of the Obligations exceed the Maximum Lawful
Amount. This provision shall control every other provision herein and in any and all other

          occasion, that on the date of commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR
          Loan, a Lender shall have determined (i) that dollar deposits in the amount of
          the requested principal amount of such LIBOR Loan are not generally available in
          the London Interbank Market; (ii) that the rate at which such dollar deposits
          are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender
          of making or maintaining such LIBOR Loan during such Interest Period; or (iii)
          that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate, such Lender
          shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give written or telephonic notice of
          such determination to the Borrowers. In the event of any such determination, any
          request by the Borrowers for a LIBOR Loan under this Agreement shall, until the
          circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be deemed to be a

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this Agreement any change

taxes imposed on the overall net income, gross receipts or added value of a Lender by the
country in which the Lender is located, or by the jurisdiction in which a Lender has its
principal office, or by any political subdivision or taxing authority therein), or shall
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve requirement, special deposit, insurance
charge (including FDIC insurance on LIBOR Liabilities) or similar requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, a Lender or shall
impose on a Lender or the London Interbank Market any other condition affecting this
Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by a Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be
to increase the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining its LIBOR Loan or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by a Lender hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise) in respect thereof by an amount deemed by the affected Lender to be
material, then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as

foreign Law; or (ii) compliance with any directive, guidelines or request from any central
bank or other United States or foreign Governmental Authority (whether or not having the

amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by a Lender (or any lending office
of a Lender) or any corporation directly or indirectly owning or controlling a Lender (or
any lending office of a Lender) based upon the existence of this Agreement, and the Lender
shall have determined that such introduction, change or compliance has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the Lender&#146;s capital or on the capital of
such owning or controlling corporation as a consequence of its obligations hereunder
(including its commitment) to a level below that which the Lender or such owning or
controlling corporation could have achieved but for such introduction, change or
compliance (after taking into account that Lender&#146;s policies or the policies of such
owning or controlling corporation, as the case may be, regarding capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by the Lender (in its sole discretion) to be material, then, from time to

compensate the Lender for such reduction attributable to making, funding and maintaining
its commitment and Loans hereunder. </FONT></P>

(or its participating banks) as specified above, as the case may be, shall be delivered to
the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided however, that the
Borrowers shall be responsible for compliance herewith and the payment of increased costs
only to the extent that (i) any change in Laws giving rise to increased costs occurs after
the date of this Agreement; and (ii) the Lender gives notice of the change giving rise to
increased costs within one hundred eighty (180) Business Days after the Lender has, or
with reasonable diligence should have had, knowledge of the change, or else Lender can
only collect costs from and after the date of the notice. Subject to the foregoing, the
Borrowers shall pay the affected Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate
within ten (10) Business Days after their receipt of such certificate. </FONT></P>

contrary to a position taken by the Lender generally with taxing authorities or any other

disadvantage the Lender in the event of such contest, as the affected Lender may determine

(effective upon receipt) specifying the Business Day each Letter of Credit is to be issued
and describing in reasonable detail the proposed terms of such Letter of Credit (including
its beneficiary) and the nature of the transactions or obligations proposed to be

On each day during the period commencing with the issuance by the Agent of any Letter of
Credit and until such Letter of Credit shall have expired or been terminated or, if drawn
upon, until the resulting obligations of reimbursement (the &#147;Reimbursement
Obligations&#148;) have been satisfied in full by Borrowers (whether by a borrowing under
this Agreement or otherwise), the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Lender shall be
deemed to be utilized for all purposes of this Agreement (including, but not limited to,
the calculation of availability) in an amount equal to such Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share
of the Letter of Credit Liabilities associated with such Letter of Credit. Each Lender
(other than the Agent) agrees that, upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit, it shall
automatically be deemed to have acquired a participation in the Agent&#146;s liability
under such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of
such liability, and each Lender (other than the Agent) thereby shall absolutely,

Forthwith upon its receipt of a notice referred to in Section&nbsp;2.16.3 hereof, PLC
shall advise the Agent whether or not PLC, on behalf of Borrowers, intends to obtain a
Loan to finance its obligation to reimburse the Agent for the amount of the related demand
for payment and, if it does, submit a notice of such borrowing as provided in this
Agreement. In the event that PLC fails to so advise the Agent, and if PLC fails to
reimburse the Agent for a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit by the date of such
payment, the Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of the amount of the demand for
payment, specifying such Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of the amount of the related demand
for payment, and Borrowers shall be deemed in default hereunder for breaching Section

be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the failure of any other Lender to make its payment under this Section 2.16.5,
the financial condition of Borrowers, the existence of any Unmatured Default or Event of
Default or the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments. Each such payment to the

or application of proceeds of any collateral security) the Agent shall promptly pay to
each Lender who shall have previously assumed a participation in such payment under clause
(ii) above, such Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of such payment, each such payment by the
Agent to be made in the same money and funds in which received by the Agent. In the event
any payment received by the Agent and so paid to Lenders is rescinded or must otherwise be

by reason of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Agent. It shall not be a
condition to any such indemnification that the Agent or any Lender shall be a party to any
such investigations, litigation or other proceeding. Nothing in this Section&nbsp;2.16.13

assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit with
respect to the use of the Letter of Credit. None of the Agent, any Lender nor any of their
respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys or agents shall be liable
or responsible for: (a) the use which may be made of the Letter of Credit or for any acts
or omissions of any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit in connection with such Letter of
Credit; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents presented to the Agent,
or of any endorsement on such documents, even if such documents should in fact prove to be
in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by the
Agent against presentation of documents which do not comply with the terms of any Letter
of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference
to such Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failure

against the Agent to the extent of damages (other than any special or consequential
damages) suffered by Borrowers which Borrowers prove were caused by the Agent&#146;s

foregoing, the Agent may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order,

acknowledge that the Agent will be required by applicable rules and regulations of the
Federal Reserve Board to maintain reserves for its liability to honor draws made pursuant
to a Letter of Credit notwithstanding the obligation of the Lenders for a participation in
such Letter of Credit Liabilities. The Borrowers agree to reimburse the Agent promptly for
all additional costs incurred by reason of any Regulatory Change that the Agent may
hereafter incur solely by reason of its acting as issuer of the Letters of Credit and its
being required to reserve for such liability, it being understood by the Borrowers that
other interest and fees payable under this Agreement do not include compensation of the
Agent for such reserves. The Agent shall furnish to the Borrowers, at the time of the
Agent&#146;s demand for payment of such additional costs, the computation of such
additional cost, which shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error, provided that such
computations are made on a reasonable basis. The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent
administrative and other fees, if any, in connection with the Letters of Credit in such
amounts and at such times as the Agent and the Borrowers shall agree from time to time. </FONT></P>

by PLICO (if any); the proposed date of the requested disbursement and the aggregate

Swingline Lender. The Borrowers agree that if the Swingline Lender elects to fund any
requested Swingline Loan(s) sooner after requested than is required hereunder, the
Swingline Lender may nevertheless use the entire response period allowed hereunder upon
receipt of any subsequent request, at its sole option. </FONT></P>

disbursement of Swingline Loans. The Account Agreements may be established using
standardized forms that do not address the specific circumstances of the Swingline Loan.
All Swingline Loans made pursuant to Account Agreements shall be deemed advanced on behalf
of PLC only. To resolve potential inconsistencies between this Agreement and Account

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>2.17.4 (a) Funding and Payment
Procedures Controlled by Account Agreements. The Account Agreements shall control this

Payment Dates, to the extent that an Account Agreement may provide for such payment more
frequently than otherwise required under this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>2.17.4 (c) Continuing Warranty Under

Borrowers&#146; warranty under Section 2.17.5 hereof as to the satisfaction of all
conditions to the right to receive Swingline Loans shall be a continuing one during any
period that such an Account Agreement may be in effect. Therefore, any Swingline Loans
funded by the Swingline Lender pursuant to an Account Agreement after the failure of a

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a Default and during the
continuation of such Default until it is cured or waived, interest shall be charged at the

remedies available to it, including, without limitation, acceleration of the maturity of
the outstanding principal of the Swingline Loans. All such interest shall be paid at the
time of and as a condition precedent to the curing of any such Default to the extent any

It is the intention of the parties that all charges under or in connection with this
Agreement and the Obligations, however denominated, and including (without limitation) all
interest, commitment fees, late charges and loan charges, shall be limited to the Maximum
Lawful Amount. Such charges hereunder shall be characterized and all provisions of the
Credit Documents shall be construed as to uphold the validity of charges provided for
therein. If for any reason whatsoever, however, any charges paid or contracted to be paid
in respect of the Swingline Loans shall exceed the Maximum Lawful Amount, then, ipso facto
the obligation to pay such interest and/or other charges shall be reduced to the Maximum
Lawful Amount in effect from time to time, and any amounts collected by Lender that exceed
the Maximum Lawful Amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of
the Swingline Loans and/or refunded to the Borrowers so that at no time shall the interest
or loan charges paid or payable in respect of the Swingline Loans exceed the Maximum
Lawful Amount. This provision shall control every other provision herein and in any and
all other agreements and instruments now existing or hereafter arising between the
Borrowers and the Swingline Lender with respect to the Swingline Loans. </FONT></P>

prepay the interest or principal on any outstanding Swingline Loans in whole or in part
without premium or penalty. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>2.17.9 Procedures Among Lenders Upon
Default. Upon the occurrence of a Default, Lenders shall acquire participation interests
in the outstanding Swingline Loans as necessary to cause each Lender to own a Pro Rata
interest in the outstanding Swingline Loans, pursuant to such documentation as Agent may
deem necessary. The obligation of each Lender to acquire such a participation interest
shall be unconditional and, without limiting the foregoing, shall remain in effect
irrespective of (i) the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default, (ii) the financial
condition of the Borrowers, the Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other Lender or (iii)
the termination or cancellation of the Revolving Credit Commitments (provided that such
Swingline Loan was made prior to the date of such termination or cancellation). The
Swingline Loans shall thereafter be administered by Lenders and Agent as though the
Swingline Loans were amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Loan. Additionally, to
this end, upon the occurrence and continuation of a Default, Agent may, in its discretion,
and without the Borrowers&#146; consent, cause an advance to be made under the Revolving
Credit Loan sufficient to repay the outstanding Swingline Loans, even if a Default is then
outstanding. </FONT></P>

          Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such Lender is a United States person
          for United States federal income tax purposes. Each Lender further undertakes to

          that if any such notice has also been furnished to Lenders, Agent shall have no
          obligation to notify Lenders with respect thereto. Each Lender shall promptly
          give Agent such a notice upon its actual knowledge of an Unmatured Default or a
          Default; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to deliver such
          notice in the absence of gross negligence or reckless or willful misconduct
          shall not affect its rights hereunder or under the other Credit Documents. </FONT></P>

          prior written notice to the Borrowers and Agent. Such resignation or removal, as
          the case may be, shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Agent as
          provided herein. The Required Lenders will appoint from among Lenders a
          successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been appointed within such

          Borrowers, a successor agent from among Lenders, who shall serve as Agent until

          Agent as provided hereinabove. Upon the written acceptance of any appointment as
          Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
          succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
          of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its
          duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents. After any

          Sharing of Payments, etc. Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the
          exercise of a right of banker&#146;s lien, set-off, counterclaim or otherwise,
          obtain payment with respect to the Obligations which results in its receiving
          more than its Pro Rata Share of the aggregate payments with respect to all of
          the Obligations, then (a) such Lender shall be deemed to have simultaneously
          purchased from the other Lenders a share in the Obligations so that the amount
          of the Obligations held by each of Lenders shall continue to equal their
          respective Pro Rata Shares, and (b) such other adjustments shall be made from
          time to time as shall be equitable to insure that Lenders share such payments
          ratably. No Lender shall exercise its banker&#146;s lien, set-off or other right
          to accomplish such payment absent Agent&#146;s prior consent. </FONT></P>

          Bankruptcy Provisions. Should the Borrowers become parties to a case under the

          extent such a filing may be necessary. Agent shall review each claim before

          with Agent&#146;s records and Agent&#146;s legal positions taken pursuant to
          this Agreement. Should the Borrowers become parties to a reorganization
          proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, each Lender shall be recognized as the
          holder of a separate claim for the purpose of the approval or rejection of a
          Plan under 11 U.S.C. &sect; 1126, may freely vote such claim, and the provisions
          of that Section shall control the other provisions of this Agreement that
          otherwise require the consent of the Required Lenders or all Lenders in certain
          circumstances. Agent shall continue to administer the Revolving Credit Loan on

          Termination. The termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of
          the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Agent or any obligation of the Borrowers, the
          Lenders or the Agent, arising prior to the effective date of such termination,
          and the provisions hereof shall continue to be fully operative until all
          transactions entered into or rights created or obligations incurred prior to
          such termination have been fully disposed of, concluded or liquidated and the
          Obligations arising prior to or after such termination have been irrevocably
          paid in full. The rights granted to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders
          hereunder and under the other Credit Documents shall continue in full force and
          effect, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, until all of the
          Obligations have been paid in full after the termination hereof or the Borrowers
          have furnished the Lenders with an indemnification satisfactory to the Lenders
          with respect thereto. All representations, warranties, covenants, waivers and
          agreements contained herein shall survive termination hereof until payment in
          full of the Obligations unless otherwise provided herein. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, if after receipt of any payment of all or any part of the
          Obligations, the Agent or the Lenders are for any reason compelled to surrender
          such payment to any Person because such payment is determined to be void or
          voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, a diversion of trust funds or
          for any other reason, this Agreement shall continue in full force and the
          Borrowers shall be liable to, and shall indemnify and hold the Agent and the
          Lenders harmless for, the amount of such payment surrendered until the Agent and
          the Lenders shall have been finally and irrevocably paid in full. The provisions
          of the foregoing sentence shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any
          contrary action which may have been taken by the Agent or the Lenders in
          reliance upon such payment, and any such contrary action so taken shall be
          without prejudice to the Agent&#146;s or the Lenders&#146; rights under this
          Agreement and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment having
          become final and irrevocable. If on any date on which the Borrowers wish to pay
          the Obligations in full and terminate this Agreement, there are any outstanding
          Letters of Credit, the Borrowers shall, unless otherwise agreed by the Required
          Lenders in their sole discretion, make a cash prepayment to the Agent on such
          date in an amount equal to the then-outstanding Letter of Credit Liabilities,
          and the Agent shall hold such prepayment in an interest-bearing cash collateral
          account in the name and under the sole control of the Agent (which account shall
          bear interest at the Agent&#146;s then-current rate for such accounts) as
          security for the Reimbursement Obligations and other Letter of Credit
          obligations. To the extent allowed by law, such account shall not constitute an
          asset of the Borrowers, or any of them, subject to their rights therein under
          this Section 10.22. The Agent shall from time to time debit such account for the
          payment of the Letter of Credit Liabilities as the same become due and payable
          and shall promptly refund any excess funds (including interest) held in said
          account to the Borrowers if and when no Letter of Credit Liabilities remain
          outstanding hereunder and all of the Obligations have been paid in full. The
          Borrowers shall remain liable for any Obligations in excess of the amounts paid
          from such account. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>A number of civil jury verdicts have
been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which PLICO does business involving
the insurers&#146; sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly
supervise agents, and other matters. Increasingly these lawsuits have resulted in the
award of substantial judgments against the insurer that are disproportionate to the actual
damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. In addition, in some class action
and other lawsuits involving insurers&#146; sales practices, insurers have made material
settlement payments. In some states, including Alabama (where PLICO maintains its
headquarters), juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive and non-economic
compensatory damages, which creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse
judgments in any given lawsuit. PLICO, like other insurers, in the ordinary course of
business, is involved in such litigation or alternatively in arbitration. The outcome of
any such litigation or arbitration cannot be predicted with certainty. </FONT></P>
