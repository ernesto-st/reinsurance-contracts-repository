      Bank has made such amount available to Agent on such date, as aforesaid
      and may, in its sole discretion and without obligation to do so, in
      reliance upon such assumption, make available to Company a corresponding
      amount. If such amount is not in fact made available to Agent by such
      Revolving Credit Bank in accordance with Section 2.8(a), as aforesaid,
      Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such
      Revolving Credit Bank. If such Revolving Credit Bank does not pay such
      amount forthwith upon Agent's demand therefor, the Agent shall promptly
      notify Company, and Company shall pay such amount to Agent. Agent shall
      also be entitled to recover from such Revolving Credit Bank or from
      Company, as the case may be, interest on such amount in respect of each
      day from the date such amount was made available by Agent to Company to
      the date such amount is recovered by Agent, at a rate per annum equal to:

                  (i)   in the case of such Revolving Credit Bank, the Federal
                        Funds Effective Rate for the first two (2) Business Days
                        such amount remains unpaid and at the rate of interest
                        applicable to the Revolving Credit Advances thereafter;
                        or

                  (ii)  in the case of Company, the rate of interest then
                        applicable to the Revolving Credit Advance.

      The obligation of any Revolving Credit Bank to make any Revolving Credit
Advance hereunder shall not be affected by the failure of any other Revolving
Credit Bank to make any Revolving Credit Advance hereunder, and no Revolving
Credit Bank shall have any liability to the Company, the Agent, any other Bank,
or any other party for another Revolving Credit Bank's failure to make any loan
or Revolving Credit Advance hereunder.

      2.9 Prime-based Advance in Absence of Election or Upon Default. If, as to
any outstanding Eurodollar-based Advance, Agent has not received payment on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or does not receive a timely
Request for Revolving Credit Advance meeting the requirements of Section 2.7
hereof with respect to the refunding or conversion of such Advance, or, subject
to Section 2.6 hereof, if on such day a Default or Event of Default shall exist,
the principal amount thereof which is not then prepaid shall be converted
automatically to a Prime-based Advance and the Agent shall thereafter promptly
notify Company of said action.

      2.10 Prepayment. (a) Company may prepay all or part of the outstanding
balance of any Prime-based Advance(s) at any time, provided that the amount of
any partial prepayment shall be at least One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000)
and the aggregate balance of Prime-based Advance(s) remaining outstanding under
the Revolving Credit Notes shall be at least Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000). Subject to the provisions of Section 10.1, Company may prepay all or
part of any Eurodollar-based Advance (subject to not less than three (3)
Business Days' notice to Agent) provided that the amount of any such partial
prepayment shall be at least One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and the
unpaid portion of such Advance which is refunded or converted under Section 2.7
shall be at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). Any prepayment made in
accordance with this Section shall be without premium, penalty or prejudice to
the right to reborrow under the terms of this Agreement.

            (b) The Company may prepay all or part of the outstanding principal
      of any Swing Line Advance carried at the Prime-based Rate at any time.

            (c) The Company may prepay at any time all or part of the
      outstanding principal of any Swing Line Advance carried at the Quoted Rate
      (subject to not less than one (1) day's notice to the Swing Line Bank)
      provided that the amount of such prepayment shall be at least Ten Thousand
      Dollars ($10,000) and, after giving effect to any such partial prepayment,
      the aggregate unpaid portion of such Swing Line Advance shall be at least
      Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000).

                                       22
<PAGE>

            (d) Any prepayment of all or any portion of the Revolving Credit,
      whether by acceleration, mandatory or required prepayment or otherwise,
      shall be subject to Section 10.1 hereof, but otherwise without premium,
      penalty or prejudice.

      2.11 Revolving Credit Facility Fee. From the date hereof to (but
excluding) the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Company shall pay to each of
the Revolving Credit Banks, a Revolving Credit Facility Fee determined by
multiplying three eighths of one percent (3/8%) per annum times the average
daily amount of the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment. The Revolving Credit
Facility Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears commencing October 15, 2006,
and on the fifteenth day of each January, April, July and October thereafter and
at the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, and shall be computed on the basis of a
year of three hundred sixty (360) days and assessed for the actual number of
days elapsed. Whenever any payment of the Revolving Credit Facility Fee shall be
due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
extended to the next Business Day. Such Revolving Credit Facility Fee shall be
paid by Company to the Agent. Upon receipt of such payment, Agent shall make
prompt payment to each Revolving Credit Bank of its share of the Revolving
Credit Facility Fee. The Revolving Credit Facility Fee shall not be refundable
under any circumstance. The portion of the Revolving Credit Facility Fee accrued
under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have accrued up to the
date of the execution of this Agreement and its related documents and be payable
under this Agreement.

      2.12 Reduction of Indebtedness; Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment. If
at any time and for any reason the aggregate principal amount of Advances to
Company under the Revolving Credit and the Swing Line and the Letter of Credit
Obligations, which shall be outstanding at such time, shall exceed the then
applicable Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment, Company shall immediately
reduce any pending request for an Advance on such day by the amount of such
excess and, to the extent any excess remains thereafter, immediately repay an
amount of the Advances equal to such excess. Company acknowledges that, in
connection with any repayment required hereunder, it shall also be responsible
for the reimbursement of any prepayment or other costs required under Section
10.1 hereof; provided, however, that Company shall, in order to reduce any such
prepayment costs and expenses, first prepay such portion of the Advances then
carried as a Prime-based Advance, if any. To the extent that, on the date any
mandatory prepayment of the Advances under this Section 2.12 is due, the
Advances under the Revolving Credit Notes are being carried, in whole or in
part, at the Eurodollar-based Rate and no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Company may deposit the amount of such mandatory
prepayment in a cash collateral account to be held by the Agent, for and on
behalf of the Revolving Credit Banks (which shall be an interest-bearing
account), on such terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to Agent and
the Majority Banks. Subject to the terms and conditions of said cash collateral
account, sums on deposit in said cash collateral account shall be applied (until
exhausted) to reduce the principal balance of the Advances on the last day of
each Interest Period attributable to the Eurodollar-based Advances.

      2.13 Optional Reduction or Termination of Revolving Credit Aggregate
Commitment. The Company may, upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written
notice to Agent, permanently reduce the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment in
whole at any time, or in part from time to time, without premium or penalty,
provided that: (i) each partial reduction of

                                       23
<PAGE>

the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment shall be in an aggregate amount equal
to at least Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) or a larger integral multiple of
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000); (ii) each reduction shall be accompanied by
the payment of the Revolving Credit Facility Fee, if any, accrued to the date of
such reduction attributable to the amount of such reduction; (iii) the Company
shall prepay in accordance with the terms hereof the amount, if any, by which
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Revolving Credit Advances plus the
outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations exceeds the amount of the Revolving
Credit Aggregate Commitment, taking into account the aforesaid reductions
thereof, together with accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount of
such prepaid Advances to the date of prepayment; (iv) if the termination or
reduction of the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment requires the prepayment
of a Eurodollar-based Advance or Quoted Rate Advance, the termination or
reduction may be made only on the last Business Day of the then current Interest
Period applicable to such Advance; and (v) no such reduction shall reduce the
Swing Line unless Company so elects. Reductions of the Revolving Credit
Aggregate Commitment and any accompanying prepayments of the Revolving Credit
Notes shall be distributed by Agent to each Revolving Credit Bank in accordance
with such Revolving Credit Bank's Percentage thereof, and will not be available
for reinstatement by or readvance to the Company, and any accompanying payments
of Advances of the Swing Line shall be distributed by Agent to the Swing Line
Bank and will not be available for reinstatement any or readvance to Company.
Any reductions of the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment hereunder shall
reduce each Revolving Credit Bank's portion thereof proportionately (based upon
the applicable Percentages), and shall be permanent and irrevocable.

      2.14 Use of Revolving Credit Proceeds. Proceeds of the Revolving Credit
(including Swing Line Advances) shall be used, subject to the terms hereof, to
finance Permitted Acquisitions and to fund working capital needs of the Company.

      2.15 Swing Line Advances. The Swing Line Bank shall, on the terms and
subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth (including without limitation
Section 2.15(c) hereof), make one or more advances (each such advance being a
"Swing Line Advance") to the Company, from time to time on any Business Day
during the period from the date hereof to (but excluding) the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date in an amount not to exceed in the aggregate at any time
outstanding the Swing Line Maximum Amount. The Swing Line Bank shall not make
any Swing Line Advance if it shall have received written notice from a Bank that
the conditions to the making of the Advance set forth in Section 4 have not been
satisfied. Swing Line Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Company to Swing Line Bank
resulting from each Swing Line Advance of such Bank from time to time, including
the amounts of principal and interest payable thereon and paid to such Bank from
time to time. The entries made in such account or accounts of Swing Line Bank
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be conclusive evidence, absent
manifest error, of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Company
therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of Swing Line Bank to
maintain such account, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any
manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay the Swing Line Advances
(and all other amounts owing with respect thereto) made to Company by Swing Line
Bank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Advances, repayments and
readvances under the Swing Line may be made, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. Each Swing Line Advance shall mature and the principal amount
thereof shall be

                                       24
<PAGE>

due and payable by the Company in the case of any Quoted Rate Advance, on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (if any) and, in the case of
any Prime-based Advance, on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

      The Company agrees that, upon the written request of Swing Line Bank, the
Company will execute and deliver to Swing Line Bank a Swing Line Note; provided,
that the delivery of such Swing Line Note shall not be a condition precedent to
the Effective Date.

            (a) Accrual of Interest. Each Swing Line Advance shall, from time to
      time after the date of such Advance, bear interest at its Applicable
      Interest Rate. The amount and date of each Swing Line Advance, its
      Applicable Interest Rate, its Interest Period, if any, and the amount and
      date of any repayment shall be noted on Swing Line Bank's account
      maintained pursuant to Section 2.15(a), which records will be conclusive
      evidence thereof, absent manifest error; provided, however, that any
      failure by the Swing Line Bank to record any such information shall not
      relieve the Company of its obligation to repay the outstanding principal
      amount of such Advance, all interest accrued thereon and any amount
      payable with respect thereto in accordance with the terms of this
      Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

            (b) Requests for Swing Line Advances. The Company may request a
      Swing Line Advance only after the delivery to Swing Line Bank of a Request
      for Swing Line Advance executed by a person authorized (in a writing a
      copy of which has been previously delivered to the Agent) by the Company
      to make such requests, subject to the following:

                  (i)   each such Request for Swing Line Advance shall set forth

                        (C)   in the case of a Quoted Rate Advance, the duration
                              of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

                        the Company on such date of determination, the aggregate
                        principal amount of all Swing Line Advances outstanding
                        on such date shall not exceed the Swing Line Maximum

                        giving effect to all Advances and Letters of Credit
                        requested by the Company on such date of determination,
                        the aggregate principal amount of all Advances of the
                        Revolving Credit and of the Swing

                        Line requested or outstanding on such date plus the
                        outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations shall not
                        exceed the then applicable Revolving Credit Aggregate
                        Commitment;

                        Prime-based Advance, the principal amount of the initial
                        funding of such Advance, as opposed to any refunding or
                        conversion thereof, shall be at least Two Hundred Fifty
                        Thousand Dollars ($250,000) or such lesser amount as
                        agreed to by Agent from time to time (unless the "Sweep
                        to Loan" system referred to in subsection (c) below is
                        in effect in which case no minimum shall apply).

                  (v)   in the case of a Swing Line Advance that is a Quoted
                        Rate Advance, the principal amount of such Advance plus
                        any other outstanding Advances of the Swing Line to be
                        then combined therewith having the same Applicable

                  (vii) each Request for Swing Line Advance, once delivered to
                        Swing Line Bank, shall be irrevocable by the Company,
                        and shall constitute and include a certification by the
                        Company as of the date thereof that:

                        (A)   both before and after making such Swing Line
                              Advance, the obligations of the Loan Parties set
                              forth in this Agreement and the other Loan
                              Documents, are valid, binding and enforceable
                              obligations of such Loan Parties;

                        (B)   all conditions to the making of Swing Line
                              Advances have been satisfied (both before and
                              after giving effect to such Advance);

                        (C)   both before and after giving effect to such Swing
                              Line Advance, there is no Default or Event of
                              Default in existence; and

                        (D)   both before and after giving effect to such Swing
                              Line Advance, the representations and warranties

                              respects, other than any

                                       26
<PAGE>

                              representation or warranty that expressly speaks
                              only as of a different date.

            (c) At the option of the Agent, subject to revocation by Agent at
      any time and from time to time and only for so long as Comerica Bank is
      the only Swing Line Credit Bank under this Agreement, the Company may
      utilize the Agent's "Sweep to Loan" automated system for obtaining Swing
      Line Advances and making periodic repayments, subject to the terms hereof.
      Each time a Swing Line Advance is made using the "Sweep to Loan" system,
      the Company shall be deemed to have certified to the Agent and the Swing
      Line Banks each of the matters set forth in clause (b) of this Section.
      Agent may revoke the Company's privilege to use the "Sweep to Loan" system
      at any time and from time to time for any reason and, immediately upon any
      such revocation, the "Sweep to Loan" system shall no longer be available
      to the Company for the funding of Swing Line Advances hereunder (or
      otherwise) and the regular procedures set forth for the making of Swing
      Line Advances shall be deemed immediately to apply.

      Swing Line Bank, may, at its option, lend under this Section 2.15(c) upon
the telephone request of an authorized officer of Company and, in the event
Swing Line Bank makes any such Advance upon a telephone request, the requesting
officer shall, if so requested by Swing Line Bank, fax to Swing Line Bank, on
the same day as such telephone request, a Request for Swing Line Advance.
Company hereby authorizes Swing Line Bank to disburse Advances under this
Section 2.15(c) pursuant to the telephone instructions of any person purporting
to be a person identified by name on a written list of persons authorized by the
Company to make Requests for Advance on behalf of the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company acknowledges that Company shall bear all risk of loss
resulting from disbursements made upon any telephone request. Each telephone
request for an Advance shall constitute a certification of the matters set forth
in the Request for Swing Line Advance form as of the date of such requested
Advance. Swing Line Bank shall promptly deliver to Agent by telecopy a copy of
any Request for Advance received hereunder.

            (d) Disbursement of Swing Line Advances. Subject to submission of an
      executed Request for Swing Line Advance by the Company without exceptions
      noted in the compliance certification therein, Swing Line Bank shall make
      available to the Company the amount so requested, in like funds and
      currencies, not later than 4:00 p.m. (Detroit time) on the date of such
      Advance by credit to an account of the Company maintained with Agent or to
      such other account or third party as the Company may reasonably direct in
      writing.

      Swing Line Bank shall promptly notify Agent of any Swing Line Advance by
telephone, telex or telecopier.

            (e) Refunding of or Participation Interest in Swing Line Advances.

                  (i)   The Agent, at any time in its sole and absolute
                        discretion, may, in each case on behalf of the Company
                        (which hereby irrevocably directs the Agent to act on
                        its behalf) request each of the Banks (including the
                        Swing Line Bank in its capacity as a Bank) to make

                                       27
<PAGE>

                        an Advance of the Revolving Credit to the Company, in an
                        amount equal to such Bank's Percentage of the principal
                        amount of the aggregate Swing Line Advances made in
                        accordance with the terms of this Agreement which are
                        outstanding on the date such notice is given (the
                        "Refunded Swing Line Advances"); provided however that
                        Swing Line Advances which are carried at the Quoted Rate
                        which are converted to Revolving Credit Advances at the
                        request of the Agent at a time when no Default or Event
                        of Default has occurred and is continuing, shall not be
                        subject to Section 10.1 and no losses, costs or expenses
                        may be assessed by the Swing Line Bank against the
                        Company or the Banks as a consequence of such
                        conversion. In the case of each Refunded Swing Line
                        Advance the applicable Advance of the Revolving Credit
                        used to refund such Swing Line Advance shall be a
                        Prime-based Advance. In connection with the making of
                        any such Refunded Swing Line Advances or the purchase of
                        a participation interest in Swing Line Advances under
                        Section 2.15(e)(ii) hereof, the Swing Line Bank shall
                        retain its claim against the Company for any unpaid

                        Agent the amount required pursuant to clause (i) or (ii)
                        above, as the case may be, the Agent shall be entitled

                        be affected by the failure of any other Bank to make
                        such amounts available, and no Bank shall have any
                        liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, the

rely on such certification without any duty of inquiry.

<PAGE>

            (b) A letter of credit facing fee in the amount equal to the greater

      account.

      special deposit, limitation or similar requirement against letters of
      credit issued or participated in by, or assets held by, or deposits in or
      for the account of, Issuing Bank or any Revolving Credit Bank or (ii)
      impose on Issuing Bank or any Bank any other condition regarding this
      Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any participations in such Letters of
      Credit, and the result of any event referred to in clause (i) or (ii)
      above shall be to increase the cost or expense to Issuing Bank or such
      Revolving Credit Bank of issuing or maintaining or participating in any of
      the Letters of Credit (which increase in cost or expense shall be
      determined by the Issuing Bank's or such Revolving Credit Bank's
      reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such cost increases and expenses
      resulting from such events), then, upon demand by the Issuing Bank or such
      Revolving Credit Bank, as the case may be, the applicable Account Party
      shall, within thirty (30) days following demand for payment, pay to
      Issuing Bank or such Revolving Credit Bank, as the case may be, from time
      to time as specified by the Issuing Bank or such Revolving Credit Bank,
      additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate the Issuing
      Bank or such Revolving Credit Bank for such increased cost and expense,
      together with interest on each such amount from ten days after the date
      such payment is due until payment in full thereof at the Prime-based Rate.
      Each demand for payment under this Section 3.4(c), shall be accompanied by
      a certificate of Issuing Bank or the applicable Revolving Credit Bank (as
      applicable) setting forth the amount of such increased cost or expense
      incurred by the Issuing Bank or such Revolving Credit Bank, as the case
      may be, as a result of any event mentioned in clause (i) or (ii) above,
      and in reasonable detail, the methodology for calculating and the
      calculation of such amount, which certificate shall be prepared in good
      faith and shall be conclusive evidence, absent manifest error, as to the
      amount thereof.

            (d) All payments by the Company to the Agent for distribution to the
      Issuing Bank or the Revolving Credit Banks under this Section 3.4 shall be
      made in Dollars in immediately available funds at the Issuing Office or
      such other office of the Agent as may be designated from time to time by
      written notice to the Company by the Agent. The fees described in clauses
      (a) and (b) above shall be nonrefundable under all circumstances and shall
      be payable upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit and thereafter
      semi-annually in advance. The fees due under clause (a) above shall be
      determined by multiplying the Applicable Fee Percentage times the undrawn
      amount of the face amount of each such Letter of Credit on the date of
      determination, and shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year and
      assessed for the actual number of days from the date of the issuance
      thereof to the stated expiration thereof. The parties hereto acknowledge
      that any amendment or extension to a Letter of Credit issued hereunder
      shall be treated as a new Letter of Credit for the purposes of the letter
      of credit facing fee.

                                       32
<PAGE>

      3.5 Other Fees. In connection with the Letters of Credit, and in addition
to the Letter of Credit Fees, the Company and the applicable Account Party(ies)
shall pay, for the sole account of the Issuing Bank, standard documentation,
administration, payment and cancellation charges assessed by Issuing Bank or the
Issuing Office, at the times, in the amounts and on the terms set forth or to be
set forth from time to time in the standard fee schedule of the Issuing Office
in effect from time to time and delivered to the relevant Account Party(ies).

      3.6 Drawings and Demands for Payment Under Letters of Credit.

            (a) If the Issuing Bank shall honor a draft or other demand for
      payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit, the Company and each
      applicable Account Party agree to pay to the Issuing Bank an amount equal
      to the amount paid by the Issuing Bank in respect of such draft or other
      demand under such Letter of Credit and all expenses paid or incurred by
      the Agent relative thereto not later than 1:00 p.m. (Detroit time), on (i)
      the Business Day that the Company receives notice of such presentment and
      honor, if such notice is received prior to 11:00 a.m. (Detroit time) or
      (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that Company receives
      such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time. Unless the
      Company or the applicable Account Party shall have made such payment to
      the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank on such day, upon each such
      payment by the Issuing Bank, the Agent shall be deemed to have disbursed
      to the Company, and the Company shall be deemed to have elected to
      substitute for the reimbursement obligation, with respect to the
      applicable Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars, a Prime-based Advance
      of the Revolving Credit for the account of the Revolving Credit Banks in
      an amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Bank in respect of
      such draft or other demand under such Letter of Credit. Such Prime-based
      Advance shall be deemed disbursed notwithstanding any failure to satisfy
      any conditions for disbursement of any Advance set forth in Section 2
      hereof and, to the extent of the Advances so disbursed, the reimbursement
      obligation of the Company or the applicable Account Party under this
      Section 3.6 shall be deemed satisfied.

            (b) If the Issuing Bank shall honor a draft or other demand for
      payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank
      shall provide notice thereof to the Company and the applicable Account
      Party on the date such draft or demand is honored, and to each Revolving
      Credit Bank on such date unless the Company or applicable Account Party
      shall have satisfied its reimbursement obligation under Section 3.6(a)
      hereof by payment to the Agent on such date. The Issuing Bank shall
      further use reasonable efforts to provide notice to the Company or
      applicable Account Party prior to honoring any such draft or other demand
      for payment, but such notice, or the failure to provide such notice, shall
      not, subject to Section 3.6(a), affect the rights or obligations of the
      Issuing Bank with respect to any Letter of Credit or the rights and
      obligations of the parties hereto, including without limitation the
      obligations of the Company or applicable Account Party under Section
      3.6(a) hereof.

            (c) Upon issuance by the Issuing Bank of each Letter of Credit
      hereunder, each Revolving Credit Bank shall automatically acquire a pro
      rata participation interest in such Letter of Credit and each related
      Letter of Credit Payment based on its respective Percentage. Each
      Revolving Credit Bank, on the date a draft or demand under any Letter

                                       33
<PAGE>

      of Credit is honored (or the next succeeding Business Day if the notice
      required to be given by Agent to the Revolving Credit Banks under Section
      3.6(b) hereof is not given to the Revolving Credit Banks prior to 2:00
      p.m. (Detroit time) on such date of draft or demand), shall make its
      Percentage of the amount paid by the Issuing Bank, and not reimbursed by
      the Company or applicable Account Party on such day, in immediately
      available funds at the principal office of the Agent for the account of
      Issuing Bank. If and to the extent such Revolving Credit Bank shall not
      have made such pro rata portion available to the Agent, such Revolving
      Credit Bank, the Company and the applicable Account Party severally agree
      to pay to the Issuing Bank forthwith on demand such amount together with
      interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount was paid by the
      Issuing Bank until such amount is so made available to the Agent at a per
      annum rate equal to the interest rate applicable during such period to the
      related Advance deemed to have been disbursed under Section 3.6(a) in
      respect of the reimbursement obligation of the Company and the applicable
      Account Party, as set forth in Section 2.4(c)(i) or 2.4(c)(ii) hereof, as
      the case may be (or, in the case of a Revolving Credit Bank, for the first
      two (2) Business Days such amount remains unpaid, at a per annum rate
      equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate and thereafter at the per annum
      rate payable by the Company and the applicable Account Party). If such
      Revolving Credit Bank shall pay such amount to the Agent for the account
      of Issuing Bank together with such interest, if any, such amount so paid
      shall be deemed to constitute an Advance by such Revolving Credit Bank
      disbursed in respect of the reimbursement obligation of the Company or
      applicable Account Party under Section 3.6(a) hereof for purposes of this
      Agreement, effective as of the dates applicable under said Section 3.6(a).
      The failure of any Revolving Credit Bank to make its pro rata portion of
      any such amount paid by the Issuing Bank available to the Agent for the
      account of Issuing Bank shall not relieve any other Revolving Credit Bank
      of its obligation to make available its pro rata portion of such amount,
      but no Revolving Credit Bank shall be responsible for failure of any other
      Revolving Credit Bank to make such pro rata portion available to the Agent
      for the account of Issuing Bank.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing however no Revolving Credit Bank shall be
deemed to have acquired a participation in a Letter of Credit if, prior to the
issuing of the Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank, the Agent or the Issuing
Bank had obtained actual knowledge that an Event of Default had occurred and was
continuing; provided, however that the Revolving Credit Banks shall be deemed to
have acquired such a participation upon the date of which such Event of Default
has been waived by the requisite Banks.

            (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require or
      authorize any Revolving Credit Bank to issue any Letter of Credit, it
      being recognized that the Issuing Bank shall be the sole issuer of Letters
      of Credit under this Agreement;

      3.7 Obligations Irrevocable. The obligations of the Company and any
Account Party to make payments to Agent for the account of Issuing Bank or the
Revolving Credit Banks with respect to Letter of Credit Obligations under
Section 3.6 hereof, shall be unconditional and irrevocable and not subject to
any qualification or exception whatsoever, including, without limitation:

                                       34
<PAGE>

            (a) Any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit
      or any documentation relating to any Letter of Credit or to any
      transaction related in any way to any Letter of Credit (the "Letter of
      Credit Documents");

            (b) Any amendment, modification, waiver, consent, or any
      substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect any interest in
      collateral or security, with

            (c) The existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which
      the Company or any Account Party may have at any time against any
      beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any persons or
      entities for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be
      acting), the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Revolving Credit Bank or any
      other person or entity, whether in connection with any of the Letter of
      Credit Documents, the transactions contemplated herein or therein or any
      unrelated transactions;

            (d) Any draft or other statement or document presented under any
      Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
      in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
      respect;

            (e) Payment by the Issuing Bank to the beneficiary under any Letter
      of Credit against presentation of documents which do not comply with the
      terms of such Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear
      any reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit;

            (f) Any failure, omission, delay or lack on the part of the Agent,
      Issuing Bank or any Revolving Credit Bank or any party to any of the
      Letter of Credit Documents to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power
      or remedy conferred upon the Agent, Issuing Bank, any Revolving Credit
      Bank or any such party under this Agreement, any of the other Loan
      Documents or any of the Letter of Credit Documents, or any other acts or
      omissions on the part of the Agent, Issuing Bank, any Revolving Credit
      Bank or any such party; or

            (g) Any other event or circumstance that would, in the absence of
      this Section 3.7, result in the release or discharge by operation of law
      or otherwise of the Company or any Account Party from the performance or
      observance of any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in Section
      3.6 hereof.

No setoff, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any obligation or any
defense of any kind or nature which the Company or any Account Party has or may
have against the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit shall be available
hereunder to the Company or any Account Party against the Agent, Issuing Bank or
any Revolving Credit Bank. Nothing contained in this Section 3.7 shall be deemed
to prevent Company after satisfaction in full of the absolute and unconditional
obligations of Company hereunder, from asserting in a separate action any claim,
defense, set off or other right which it may have against Agent, Issuing Bank or
any Revolving Credit Bank.

      3.8 Risk Under Letters of Credit. (a) In the administration and handling
of Letters of Credit and any security therefor, or any documents or instruments
given in connection therewith,

                                       35
<PAGE>

Issuing Bank shall have the sole right to take or refrain from taking any and
all actions under or upon the Letters of Credit.

            (b) Subject to other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Issuing
      Bank shall issue the Letters of Credit and shall hold the documents
      related thereto in its own name and shall make all collections thereunder
      and otherwise administer the Letters of Credit in accordance with Issuing
      Bank's regularly established practices and procedures and will have no
      further obligation with respect thereto. In the administration of Letters
      of Credit, Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any action taken or
      omitted on the advice of counsel, accountants, appraisers or other experts
      selected by Issuing Bank with due care and Issuing Bank may rely upon any
      notice, communication, certificate or other statement from the Company,
      any Account Party, beneficiaries of Letters of Credit, or any other Person
      which Issuing Bank believes to be authentic. Issuing Bank will, upon
      request, furnish the Revolving Credit Banks with copies of Letter of
      Credit Documents related thereto.

            (c) In connection with the issuance and administration of Letters of
      Credit and the assignments hereunder, Issuing Bank makes no representation
      and shall have no responsibility with respect to (i) the obligations of
      the Company or any Account Party or the validity, sufficiency or
      enforceability of any document or instrument given in connection
      therewith, or the taking of any action with respect to same, (ii) the
      financial condition of, any representations made by, or any act or
      omission of, the Company, the applicable Account Party or any other
      Person, or (iii) any failure or delay in exercising any rights or powers
      possessed by Issuing Bank in its capacity as issuer of Letters of Credit
      in the absence of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each of the
      Revolving Credit Banks expressly acknowledges that it has made and will
      continue to make its own evaluations of the Company's and the Account
      Parties' creditworthiness without reliance on any representation of
      Issuing Bank or Issuing Bank's officers, agents and employees.

            (d) If at any time Issuing Bank shall recover any part of any
      unreimbursed amount for any draw or other demand for payment under a
      Letter of Credit, or any interest thereon, Agent or Issuing Bank, as the
      case may be, shall receive same for the pro rata benefit of the Revolving
      Credit Banks in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit
      Percentages and shall promptly deliver to each Revolving Credit Bank its
      share thereof, less such Bank's pro rata share of the costs of such
      recovery, including court costs and attorney's fees. If at any time any
      Revolving Credit Bank shall receive from any source whatsoever any payment
      on any such unreimbursed amount or interest thereon in excess of such
      Bank's Revolving Credit Percentage of such payment, such Revolving Credit
      Bank will promptly pay over such excess to Agent, for redistribution in
      accordance with this Agreement.

      3.9 Indemnification. The Company and each Account Party hereby indemnifies
and agrees to hold harmless the Revolving Credit Banks, the Issuing Bank and the
Agent, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an
"L/C Indemnified Person"), from and against any and all claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which the
Revolving Credit Banks, the Issuing Bank or the Agent or any such Person may
incur or which may be claimed against any of them by reason of or in connection

                                       36
<PAGE>

with any Letter of Credit (collectively, the "L/C Indemnified Amounts"), and
none of the Issuing Bank, any Revolving Credit Bank or the Agent or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable or
responsible for:

            (a) the use which may be made of any Letter of Credit or for any
      acts or omissions of any beneficiary in connection therewith;

            (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents or of any
      endorsement thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in
      any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged;

            (c) payment by the Issuing Bank to the beneficiary under any Letter
      of Credit against presentation of documents which do not strictly comply
      with the terms of any Letter of Credit (unless such payment resulted from
      the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank), including
      failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to
      such Letter of Credit;

            (d) any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission,
      dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in
      connection with any Letter of Credit; or

            (e) any other event or circumstance whatsoever arising in connection
      with any Letter of Credit;

            (f) It is understood that in making any payment under a Letter of
      Credit the Issuing Bank will rely on documents presented to it under such
      Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein without
      further investigation and regardless of any notice or information to the
      contrary.

With respect to subparagraphs (a) through (e) hereof, (i) Company shall not be
required to indemnify any L/C Indemnified Person for any L/C Indemnified Amounts
to the extent such amounts result from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such L/C Indemnified Person or any officer, director, employee or
agent of such L/C Indemnified Person and (ii) the Issuing Bank shall be liable
to Company to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or incidental, damages suffered by Company which were caused by
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank or any officer,
director, employee or agent of the Issuing Bank or by the Issuing Bank's
wrongful dishonor of any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
beneficiary thereunder of a draft or other demand for payment and other
documentation strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of
Credit.

      3.10 Right of Reimbursement. Each Revolving Credit Bank agrees to
reimburse the Issuing Bank on demand, pro rata in accordance with its respective
Percentage, for (i) the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Issuing Bank to be reimbursed by the Company or any Account Party pursuant to
any Letter of Credit Agreement or any Letter of Credit, to the extent not
reimbursed by the Company or any Account Party and (ii) any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, fees,
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Issuing Bank
in any way relating to or

                                       37
<PAGE>

arising out of this Agreement (including Section 3.6(c) hereof), any Letter of
Credit, any documentation or any transaction relating thereto, or any Letter of
Credit Agreement, to the extent not reimbursed by the Company or any Account
Party, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, costs or expenses
were incurred by Issuing Bank as a result of Issuing Bank's gross negligence or
willful misconduct or by the Issuing Bank's wrongful dishonor of any Letter of
Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary thereunder of a draft or
other demand for payment and other documentation strictly complying with the
terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

      Effect, Company and its Subsidiaries have all material approvals,
      authorizations, consents, licenses, orders and other permits of all
      governmental agencies and authorities, whether federal, state or local,
      required to permit the operation of their business as presently conducted,
      except such approvals, authorizations, consents, licenses, orders and

      or administrative proceeding, nor so far as is known by Company is any
      litigation or administrative proceeding threatened against Company or any
      Subsidiary, the outcome of which would reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect which in either case (i) asserts or alleges that
      Company or any Subsidiary violated Hazardous Material Laws, (ii) asserts
      or alleges that Company or any Subsidiary is required to clean up, remove,
      or take remedial or other response action due to the disposal, depositing,

      materials, (iii) asserts or alleges that Company or any Subsidiary is

      other release of any hazardous substances or materials by Company or any
      Subsidiary.

            (c) Neither Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to any judgment,
      decree, order or citation related to or arising out of applicable
      Hazardous Material Laws which would reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect and to the best knowledge of the Company, neither
      Company nor any Subsidiary has been named or listed as a potentially
      responsible party by any governmental body or agency in a matter arising
      under any applicable Hazardous Material Laws which would reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (d) To the best of Company's knowledge, Company and its Subsidiaries
      have all permits, licenses and approvals required under applicable
      Hazardous Material Laws, the failure of which to have would have a
      Material Adverse Effect

                                       42
<PAGE>

      5.12 No Defaults. There exists no material default under the provisions of
any instrument evidencing any indebtedness for borrowed money of Company which
is permitted hereunder or of any agreement relating thereto which would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      5.13 Consents, Approvals and Filings, Etc. Except as have been previously
obtained, no authorization, consent, approval, license, qualification or formal
exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any court,
governmental agency or regulatory authority or any securities exchange or any
other person or party (whether or not governmental) is required in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance: (i) by Company of this Agreement,
any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or any other documents
or instruments to be executed and or delivered by Company in connection
therewith or herewith, or (ii) by Company of the Liens granted, conveyed or
otherwise established (or to be granted, conveyed or otherwise established) by
or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for such filings to
be made as are required by the Loan Documents to perfect Liens in favor of the
Agent. All such authorizations, consents, approvals, licenses, qualifications,
exemptions, filings, declarations and registrations which have previously been
obtained or made, as the case may be, are in full force and effect and are not
the subject of any attack, or to the knowledge of Company threatened attack (in
any material respect) by appeal or direct proceeding or otherwise.

its Subsidiaries is party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any
charter or other corporate restriction which has a Material Adverse Effect.

      5.15 Labor Relations. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is engaged in
any unfair labor practice that could reasonably be expected to have a Material

      United States District Court of a trustee to administer such Pension Plan
      and such reportable event is not corrected and such determination is not

            (p) if the operation of Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
      become subject to the control of any Regulatory Agency, other than in the
      normal course of business.

continuing hereunder: (v) the Agent shall, upon being directed to do so by the
Majority Banks, declare the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment terminated;
(w) the Agent shall, upon being directed to do so by the Majority Banks, declare
the entire unpaid principal Indebtedness, including the Notes, immediately due
and payable, without presentment, notice or demand, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by Company; (x) upon the occurrence of any Event of Default
specified in subsection 8.1(l), above, and notwithstanding the lack of any
declaration by Agent under preceding clause (w), the entire unpaid principal
Indebtedness, including the Notes, shall become automatically and immediately
due and payable, and the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment shall be
automatically and immediately terminated; and (y) the Agent shall, if directed
to do so by the Majority Banks or the Banks, as applicable (subject to the terms
hereof), exercise any remedy permitted by this Agreement, the Loan Documents or
law and (z) the Agent shall, upon being directed to do so by the Majority Banks,
demand immediate delivery of cash collateral, and Company and each Account Party
agrees to deliver such cash collateral upon demand, in an amount equal to the
maximum amount that may be available to be drawn at any time prior to the stated

Bank with copies of all the notices delivered under this Section and (ii) notify
each Bank in the event it accelerates any of Company's obligations hereunder.

      8.3 Rights Cumulative. No delay or failure of Agent and/or Banks in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall affect such right,
power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other power, right or
privilege. The rights of Agent and Banks under this Agreement are cumulative and
not exclusive of any right or remedies which Banks would otherwise have.

      8.4 Waiver by Company of Certain Laws. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, Company hereby agrees to waive, and does hereby absolutely and
irrevocably waive and relinquish the benefit and advantage of any valuation,
stay, appraisement, extension or redemption laws now existing or which may
hereafter exist, which, but for this provision, might be applicable to any sale
made under the judgment, order or decree of any court, on any claim for interest
on the Notes, or any Lien contemplated by or granted under or in connection with
this Agreement. These waivers have been voluntarily given, with full knowledge
of the consequences thereof.

      8.5 Waiver of Defaults. No Event of Default shall be waived by the Banks
except in a writing signed by an officer of the Agent in accordance with Section
12.11 hereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder, nor any delay in the exercise thereof, shall preclude other or
further exercise of their rights by Agent or the Banks. No waiver of any Event
of Default shall extend to any other or further Event of Default. No forbearance
on the part

                                       57
<PAGE>

of the Agent or the Banks in enforcing any of their rights shall constitute a
waiver of any of their rights. Company expressly agrees that this Section may
not be waived or modified by the Banks or Agent by course of performance,
estoppel or otherwise.

      8.6 Deposits and Accounts. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default, each Bank may at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Company (any requirement for such notice being
expressly waived by the Company) set off and apply against any and all of the
obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under this Agreement,
whether owing to such Bank or any other Bank or the Agent, any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and
other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the
account of the Company and any property of the Company from time to time in
possession of such Bank, irrespective of whether or not such deposits held or
indebtedness owing by such Bank may be contingent and unmatured and regardless
of whether any Collateral then held by Agent or any Bank is adequate to cover
the Indebtedness. Promptly following any such setoff, such Bank shall give
written notice to Agent and to Company of the occurrence thereof. The Company
hereby grants to the Banks and the Agent a Lien on all such deposits,
indebtedness and property as collateral security for the payment and performance
of all of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. The rights of
each Bank under this Section 8.6 are in addition to the other rights and
remedies which such Bank may have.

      9. PAYMENTS, RECOVERIES AND COLLECTIONS.

      9.1 Payment Procedure. (a) All payments by Company of principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or in respect of any Letter of Credit Obligations under
the Revolving Credit or of Fees, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim on
the date specified for payment under this Agreement not later than 11:00 a.m.
(Detroit time) in immediately available funds to Agent, for the ratable account
of the Revolving Credit Banks in the case of payments with respect to the
Revolving Credit, at Agent's office located at One Detroit Center, Detroit,
Michigan 48226 (care of Agent's Eurodollar Lending Office, for Eurodollar-based
Advances bearing interest at the Eurodollar-based Rate). Upon receipt by the
Agent of each such payment, the Agent shall make prompt payment in like funds
received to each Bank as appropriate, or, in respect of Eurodollar-based
Advances bearing interest at the Eurodollar-based Rate, to such Bank's
Eurodollar Lending Office.

            (b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified by Company prior to
      the date on which any payment to be made by Company is due that Company
      does not intend to remit such payment, the Agent may, in its sole
      discretion and without obligation to do so, assume that the Company has
      remitted such payment when so due and the Agent may, in reliance upon such
      assumption, make available to each Revolving Credit Bank, on such payment
      date an amount equal to such Bank's share of such assumed payment. If
      Company has not in fact remitted such payment to the Agent each Bank shall
      forthwith on demand repay to the Agent the amount of such assumed payment
      made available or transferred to such Bank, together with the interest
      thereon, in respect of each day from and including the date such amount
      was made available by the Agent to such Bank to the date such amount is
      repaid to the Agent at a rate per annum equal to (i) for Prime-based
      Advances, the Federal Funds Effective Rate (daily average), as the same
      may vary from

                                       58
<PAGE>

      time to time, and (ii) with respect to Eurodollar-based Advances or Quoted
      Rate Advances, Agent's aggregate marginal cost (including the cost of
      maintaining any required reserves or deposit insurance and of any fees,
      penalties, overdraft charges or other costs or expenses incurred by Agent)
      of carrying such amount.

            (c) Subject to the definition of Interest Period, whenever any
      payment to be made hereunder shall otherwise be due on a day which is not
      a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business
      Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest, if
      any, in connection with such payment.

            (d) All payments to be made by the Company under this Agreement or
      any of the Notes shall be made without set-off or counterclaim, as
      aforesaid, and without deduction, except for Excluded Taxes, for or on
      account of any present or future withholding or other taxes of any nature
      imposed by any governmental authority or of any political subdivision
      thereof or any federation or organization of which such governmental
      authority may at the time of payment be a member, unless Company is
      compelled by law to make payment subject to such tax. In such event,
      Company shall:

                  (i)   pay to the Agent for Agent's own account and/or, as the
                        case may be, for the account of the Banks (or, in the
                        case of Advances of the Swing Line, pay to the Swing
                        Line Bank which funded such Advances) such additional
                        amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the Agent
                        and/or such Bank or Banks receive a net amount equal to
                        the full amount which would have been receivable had
                        payment not been made subject to such tax; and

                  (ii)  remit such tax to the relevant taxing authorities
                        according to applicable law, and send to the Agent or
                        the applicable Bank (including the Swing Line Bank) or
                        Banks, as the case may be, such certificates or
                        certified copy receipts as the Agent or such Bank or
                        Banks shall reasonably require as proof of the payment
                        by the Company, of any such taxes payable by the
                        Company.

      If any tax of the United States of America or any other governmental
authority shall be or become applicable (y) after the date of this Agreement, to
such payments by Company made to a Bank's principal lending office or any other
office that such Bank may claim as its applicable lending office, or (z) after
such Bank's selection and designation of any other lending office, to such
payments made to such other lending office, such Bank shall use reasonable
efforts to make, fund and maintain its Advances and other extensions of credit
through another lending office of such Bank in another jurisdiction so as to
reduce Company's liability hereunder, if the making, funding or maintenance of
such Advances and other extensions of credit through such other lending office
of such Bank does not, in the reasonable judgement of such Bank, otherwise
adversely and materially affect such Advances and other extensions of credit, or
such Bank's applicable obligations under the Revolving Credit Aggregate
Commitment or such Bank.

      As used herein, the terms "tax", "taxes" and "taxation" include all
existing taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions and
withholdings and any restrictions or conditions

                                       59
<PAGE>

resulting in a charge together with interest thereon and fines and penalties
with respect thereto which may be imposed by reason of any violation or default
with respect to the law regarding such tax, assessed as a result of or in
connection with the transactions hereunder, or the payment and or receipt of
funds hereunder, or the payment or delivery of funds into or out of any
jurisdiction other than the United States (whether assessed against Company,
Agent or any of the Banks); however, the terms "tax", "taxes" and "taxation"
shall not include in the case of each Bank and the Agent, (i) taxes measured by
its net income, franchise and similar taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction
under the laws of which such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized
or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank, taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Bank's applicable lending office or
any political subdivision thereof and (ii) if such Bank or the Agent is entitled
at such time to an exemption from withholding that is required to be evidenced
by a United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 or other successor
form or, in each case, any successor or additional form, taxes imposed by reason
of any failure of such Bank or the Agent to deliver to the Agent or Company,
from time to time as required by the Agent or Company, such Form 1001 or 4224 or
other successor form (as applicable) or, in each case, any successor or
additional form, completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and
Company (collectively, "Excluded Taxes").

      9.2 Application of Proceeds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, after an Event of Default, the proceeds of any offsets or
voluntary payments by Company or any Guarantor or others and any other sums
received or collected in respect of the Indebtedness, shall be applied, first,
to the Notes on a pro rata basis (in proportion to the applicable Percentages of
the Advances held by each of the Banks), next, to any other Indebtedness on a
pro rata basis, and then, if there is any excess, to Company. The application of
such proceeds and other sums to the Revolving Credit Notes and the Swing Line
Notes shall be based on each Bank's Percentage of the aggregate of the Advances.

      9.3 Pro-rata Recovery. If any Bank shall obtain any payment or other
recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of offset or otherwise)
on account of principal of, or interest on, any of the Revolving Credit Notes in
excess of its pro rata share of payments then or thereafter obtained by all
Banks upon principal of and interest on all Revolving Credit Notes, such Bank
shall purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Revolving Credit
Notes held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share
the excess payment or other recovery ratably in accordance with the Percentage
with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess
payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing holder,
the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of
such recovery, but without interest.

      9.4 Deposits and Accounts. In addition to and not in limitation of any
rights of any Bank or other holder of any of the Notes under applicable law,
each Bank and each other such holder shall, upon acceleration of the
Indebtedness under the Notes and without notice or demand of any kind, have the
right to appropriate and apply to the payment of the Notes owing to it any and
all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of Company then or
thereafter with such Bank or other holder; provided, however, that any such
amount so applied by any Bank or other holder on any of the Notes owing to it
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 9.3, hereof.

      10. CHANGES IN LAW OR CIRCUMSTANCES; INCREASED COSTS; MARGIN ADJUSTMENTS.

      10.1 Reimbursement of Prepayment Costs. If Company makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Eurodollar-based Advance or Quoted Rate Advance on
any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto
(whether voluntarily, by acceleration, or otherwise), or if Company fails to
borrow any Eurodollar-based Advance or Quoted Rate Advance after notice has been
given by Company to Agent in accordance with the terms hereof requesting such
Advance, or if Company fails to make any payment of principal or interest in
respect of a Eurodollar-based Advance or Quoted Rate Advance when due, Company
shall reimburse Agent and Banks, as the case may be on demand for any resulting
loss, cost or expense actually incurred by Agent and Banks, as the case may be,
as a result thereof, including, without limitation, any such loss, cost or
expense incurred in obtaining, liquidating, employing or redeploying deposits
from third parties, whether or not Agent and Banks, as the case may be, shall
have funded or committed to fund such Advance. Such amount payable by Company to
Agent and Banks, as the case may be may include, without limitation, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, refunded or converted, for
the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, refund
or convert, through the last day of the relevant Interest Period, at the
applicable rate of interest for said Advance(s) provided under this Agreement,
over (b) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by Agent and Banks, as
the case may be) which would have accrued to Agent and Banks, as the case may be
on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with
leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. Calculation of any amounts
payable to any Bank under this paragraph shall be made as though such Bank shall
have actually funded or committed to fund the relevant Advance through the
purchase of an underlying deposit in an amount equal to the amount of such
Advance and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period;
provided, however, that any Bank may fund any Eurodollar-based Advance or Quoted
Rate Advance, in any manner it deems fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be
utilized only for the purpose of the calculation of amounts payable under this
paragraph. Upon the written request of Company, Agent and Banks shall deliver to
Company a certificate setting forth the basis for determining such losses, costs
and expenses, which certificate shall be conclusively presumed correct, absent
manifest error.

      10.2 Agent's Eurodollar Lending Office. For any Advance which the
Eurodollar-based Rate is applicable, if Agent shall designate a Eurodollar
Lending Office which maintains books separate from those of the rest of Agent,
Agent shall have the option of maintaining and carrying the relevant Advance on
the books of such Eurodollar Lending Office.

      10.3 Circumstances Affecting Eurodollar-based Rate Availability. If with
respect to any Interest Period, Agent or the Banks (after consultation with
Agent) shall determine that, by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank
markets generally, deposits in eurodollars in the applicable amounts are not
being offered to the Agent for such Interest Period, then Agent shall forthwith
give notice thereof to the Company. Thereafter, until Agent notifies Company
that such circumstances no longer exist, the obligation of Banks to make
Eurodollar-based Advances and the right of Company to convert an Advance to or
refund an Advance as a Eurodollar-based Advance shall be suspended, and the
Company shall repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each such
Eurodollar-based Advance covered hereby together with accrued interest

                                       61
<PAGE>

thereon, any amounts payable under Section 10.1, hereof, and all other amounts
payable hereunder on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable
to such Advance which bears interest at the Eurodollar-based Rate. Upon the date
for repayment as aforesaid and unless Company notifies Agent to the contrary
within two (2) Business Days after receiving a notice from Agent pursuant to
this Section, such outstanding principal amount shall be converted to a
Prime-based Advance as of the last day of such Interest Period.

      10.4 Laws Affecting Eurodollar-based Rate Availability. In the event that
any applicable law, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) now or
hereafter in effect and whether or not currently applicable to any Bank or the
Agent or any interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by the Agent or any of the Banks (or any of their respective
Eurodollar Lending Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, shall make it unlawful or impossible
for any of the Banks (or any of their respective Eurodollar Lending Offices) to
honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any Advance with interest at
the Eurodollar-based Rate, Agent shall so notify Company and the right of
Company to convert an Advance or refund an Advance as a Eurodollar-based
Advance, shall be suspended and thereafter Company may select as Applicable
Interest Rates only those which remain available and which are permitted to be
selected hereunder, and if any of the Banks may not lawfully continue to
maintain an Advance to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable
thereto at the Eurodollar-based Rate, Company shall immediately prepay such
Advance, together with interest to the date of payment, and any amounts payable
under Sections 10.1 with respect to such prepayment and the Applicable Interest
Rate shall immediately be converted to the Prime-based Rate.

      10.5 Increased Costs. In the event that any applicable law, rule or
regulation (whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and whether
or not currently applicable to any Bank or the Agent or any interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by Agent or any of the Banks with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) made by any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency after the date hereof:

            (a) shall subject the Agent or any of the Banks to any tax (other
      than Excluded Taxes), duty or other charge with respect to any Advance or
      any Note or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to the Agent or
      any of the Banks of the principal of or interest on any Advance or any
      Note or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect thereof
      (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income or
      revenues, for changes in the rates of franchise taxes or for changes in
      the rates of similar taxes of the Agent or of any of the Banks imposed by
      the United States of America or the jurisdiction in which such Bank's
      principal executive office or applicable lending office is located); or

            (b) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including,
      without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal
      Reserve System), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
      deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by the Agent or
      any of the Banks or shall impose on the Agent or

                                       62
<PAGE>
      any of the Banks or the interbank markets any other condition affecting
      any Advance or any of the Notes;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the costs to the Agent or
any of the Banks of making, funding or maintaining any part of the Indebtedness
hereunder with interest at the Eurodollar-based Rate or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by the Agent or any of the Banks under this
Agreement or under the Notes then Agent or Bank, as the case may be, shall
promptly notify the Company of such fact and demand compensation therefor and,
within fifteen (15) days after such notice, Company agrees to pay to Agent or
such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Agent or such
Bank or Banks for such increased cost or reduction. A certificate of Agent or
such Bank setting forth the basis for determining such additional amount or
amounts necessary to compensate Agent or such Bank or Banks shall be
conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error.

      10.6 Substitution of Banks. If (i) the obligation of any Revolving Credit
Bank to make Eurodollar-based Advances has been suspended pursuant to Section
10.3 or Section 10.4, (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 10.5
or 10.7 or (iii) has wrongfully failed to fund its percentage of any requested
Advance under Section 2.4(c) (in each case, an "Affected Lender"), Company shall
have the right, with the assistance of the Agent, to seek a substitute lender or
lenders (which may be one or more of the Banks (the "Purchasing Lender" or
"Purchasing Lenders") to purchase the Notes and assume the commitment (including
without limitation its participations in Swing Line Advances and Letters of
Credit) under this Agreement of such Affected Lender. The Affected Lender shall
be obligated to sell its Notes and assign its commitment to such Purchasing
Lender or Purchasing Lenders within fifteen days after receiving notice from
Company requiring it to do so, at an aggregate price equal to the outstanding
principal amount thereof plus unpaid interest accrued thereon up to but
excluding the date of the sale. In connection with any such sale, and as a
condition thereof, Company shall pay to the Affected Lender all fees accrued for
its account hereunder to but excluding the date of such sale, plus, if demanded
by the Affected Lender at least two Business Days prior to such sale, (i) the
amount of any compensation which would be due to the Affected Lender under
Section 10.1 if Company has prepaid the outstanding Eurodollar-based Advances of
the Affected Lender on the date of such sale and (ii) any additional
compensation accrued for its account under Section 10.5 or 10.7 to but excluding
said date. Upon such sale, the Purchasing Lender or Purchasing Lenders shall
assume the Affected Lender's commitment and the Affected Lender shall be
released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent. The Affected
Lender, as assignor, such Purchasing Lender, as assignee, Company and the Agent,
shall enter into an Assignment Agreement pursuant to, and subject to the
conditions of, Section 12.8 hereof. In connection with any assignment pursuant
to this Section 10.6, Company or the Purchasing Lender shall pay to the Agent
the administrative fee for processing such assignment referred to in Section
12.8.

      10.7 Other Increased Costs. In the event that after the date hereof the
adoption of or any change in any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation
(whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and whether or not
presently applicable to any Bank or Agent, or any interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank or Agent
with any guideline, request or directive of any such authority (whether or not
having the force of law), including any risk based capital guidelines, affects
or would affect the amount of capital required or expected

                                       63
<PAGE>

to be maintained by such Bank or Agent (or any corporation controlling such Bank
or Agent) and such Bank or Agent, as the case may be, determines that the amount
of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Bank's or
Agent's obligations or Advances hereunder and such increase has the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or Agent's (or such controlling
corporation's) capital as a consequence of such obligations, Advances hereunder
to a level below that which such Bank or Agent (or such controlling corporation)
could have achieved but for such circumstances (taking into consideration its
policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank or
Agent to be material, then the Company shall pay to such Bank or Agent, as the
case may be, from time to time, upon request by such Bank or Agent, additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank or Agent (or such controlling
corporation) for any increase in the amount of capital and reduced rate of
return which such Bank or Agent reasonably determines to be allocable to the
existence of such Bank's or Agent's obligations or Advances hereunder. A
statement as to the amount of such compensation, prepared in good faith and in
reasonable detail by such Bank or Agent, as the case may be, shall be submitted
by such Bank or by Agent to the Company, reasonably promptly after becoming
aware of any event described in this Section 10.7 and shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error in computation.

      11. AGENT

      11.1 Appointment of Agent. Each Bank and the holder of each Note
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act on behalf of such Bank or
holder under this Agreement and the Loan Documents and to exercise such powers
hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to Agent by the terms
hereof and thereof, together with such powers as may be reasonably incidental
thereto, including without limitation the power to execute or authorize the
execution of financing or similar statements or notices, and other documents. In
performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, the Agent shall act
solely as agent of the Banks and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have
assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for
Company. Each Bank agrees (which agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement) to reimburse Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including house and outside attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by
Agent hereunder or in connection herewith or with an Event of Default or in
enforcing the obligations of Company under this Agreement or the Loan Documents
or any other instrument executed pursuant hereto, and for which Agent is not
reimbursed by Company, pro rata according to such Bank's Percentage. Agent shall
not be required to take any action requested by any Bank under the Loan
Documents, or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of the Loan Documents,
unless indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against loss, costs,
liability and expense. If any indemnity furnished to Agent shall become
impaired, it may call for additional indemnity and cease to do the acts
indemnified against until such additional indemnity is given.

      11.2 Deposit Account with Agent. Company hereby authorizes Agent, in
Agent's sole discretion, to charge its general deposit account(s), if any,
maintained with Agent for the amount of any principal, interest, or other
amounts or costs due under this Agreement when the same become due and payable
under the terms of this Agreement or the Notes.

      11.3 Scope of Agent's Duties. The Agent shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, and shall not, by
reason of this Agreement or otherwise, have a

                                       64
<PAGE>

fiduciary relationship with any Bank (and no implied covenants or other
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Agent). Neither Agent
nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to any
Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement or
any document executed pursuant hereto, or in connection herewith or therewith
with the consent or at the request of the Majority Banks or in the absence of
their own gross negligence or wilful misconduct, nor be responsible for or have
any duties to ascertain, inquire into or verify (a) any recitals or warranties
herein or therein, (b) the effectiveness, enforceability, validity or due
execution of this Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto or any
security thereunder, (c) the performance by Company of its obligations hereunder
or thereunder, or (d) the satisfaction of any condition hereunder or thereunder,
including without limitation the making of any Advance or the issuance of any
Letter of Credit. Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certificate, notice,
document or other communication (including any cable, telegraph, telex,
facsimile transmission or oral communication) believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been sent or given by or on behalf of a proper person. Agent
may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof. Agent may employ agents
and may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Company), independent
public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable to
the Banks (except as to money or property received by them or their authorized
agents), for the negligence or misconduct of any such agent selected by it with
reasonable care or for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good
faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

      11.4 Successor Agent. Agent may resign as such at any time upon at least
thirty (30) days prior notice to Company and all Banks. If Agent at any time
shall resign or if the office of Agent shall become vacant for any other reason,
Majority Banks shall, by written instrument, appoint successor agent(s)
satisfactory to such Majority Banks, and, so long as no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, to Company. Such successor agent shall
thereupon become the Agent hereunder, as applicable, and shall be entitled to
receive from the prior Agent such documents of transfer and assignment as such
successor Agent may reasonably request. Any such successor Agent shall be a
commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof and shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.
If a successor is not so appointed or does not accept such appointment before
the resigning Agent's resignation becomes effective, the resigning Agent may
appoint a temporary successor to act until such appointment by the Majority
Banks is made and accepted or if no such temporary successor is appointed as
provided above by the resigning Agent, the Majority Banks shall thereafter
perform all of the duties of the resigning Agent hereunder until such
appointment by the Majority Banks is made and accepted. Such successor Agent
shall succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the resigning Agent as if
originally named. The resigning Agent shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to
such successor Agent all moneys at the time held by the resigning Agent
hereunder after deducting therefrom its expenses for which it is entitled to be
reimbursed. Upon such succession of any such successor Agent, the provisions of
this Article 11 shall continue in effect for the benefit of the resigning Agent
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as Agent.

      11.5 Loans by Agent. Comerica Bank and its successors and assigns, in its
capacity as a Bank hereunder, shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as
any other Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it
were not the Agent. Comerica Bank and its affiliates may (without having to
account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from, lend

                                       65
<PAGE>

money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory
or other business with Company (or the shareholders of Company) as if it were
not acting as Agent hereunder, and may accept fees and other consideration
therefor without having to account for the same to the Banks.

      11.6 Credit Decisions. Each Bank acknowledges that it has, independently
of Agent and each other Bank and based on the financial statements of Company
and such other documents, information and investigations as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit decision to extend credit hereunder from time
to time. Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently of Agent and
each other Bank and based on such other documents, information and
investigations as it shall deem appropriate at any time, continue to make its
own credit decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any
rights and privileges available to it under this Agreement or any document
executed pursuant hereto.

      11.7 Agent's Fees. Company shall pay to Agent the annual agency fee and
such other fees and charges in the amounts and at the times set forth in the
letter agreement between Company and Agent dated June 30, 2006. The Agent's Fees
described in this Section 11.7 shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

      11.8 Authority of Agent to Enforce Notes, This Agreement and other Loan
Documents. Each Bank, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
authorizes the Agent with full power and authority as attorney-in-fact to
institute and maintain actions, suits or proceedings for the collection and
enforcement of the Notes and to file such proofs of debt or other documents as
may be necessary to have the claims of the Banks allowed in any proceeding
relative to Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective creditors
or affecting their respective properties, and to take such other actions which
Agent considers to be necessary or desirable for the protection, collection and
enforcement of the Notes, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

      11.9 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent (to the
extent not reimbursed by Company, but without limiting any obligation of Company
to make such reimbursement), ratably according to their respective Percentages
of the aggregate of the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment, from and against
any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses of any kind
or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel) which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted
by the Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; provided,
however, that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such claims, damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses resulting from the Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank
agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for
such expenses by Company, but without limiting the obligation of Company to make
such reimbursement. Each Bank agrees

                                       66
<PAGE>

to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amounts
owing to the Agent by the Banks pursuant to this Section. If the indemnity
furnished to the Agent under this Section shall, in the judgment of the Agent,
be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for additional indemnity
from the Banks and cease, or not commence, to take any action until such
additional indemnity is furnished.

      11.10 Knowledge of Default. It is expressly understood and agreed that the
Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, unless the officers of the Agent immediately responsible for matters
concerning this Agreement shall have been notified in a writing specifying such
Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default" by a Bank
or by Company. Upon receiving such a notice, the Agent shall promptly notify
each Bank of such Event of Default and provide each Bank with a copy of such
notice. Agent shall also furnish the Banks, promptly upon receipt, with copies
of all other notices, reports or other information required to be provided by
Company hereunder.

      11.11 Agent's Authorization; Action by Banks. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, whenever the Agent is authorized and empowered
hereunder on behalf of the Banks to give any approval or consent, or to make any
request, or to take any other action on behalf of the Banks (including without
limitation the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents), the Agent shall be required to give such approval or consent, or to
make such request or to take such other action only when so requested in writing
by the Majority Banks or the Banks, as applicable hereunder. Action that may be
taken by Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for
hereunder) may be taken (i) pursuant to a vote at a meeting (which may be held
by telephone conference call) as to which all of the Banks have been given
reasonable advance notice, or (ii) pursuant to the written consent of the
requisite Percentages of the Banks as required hereunder, provided that all of
the Banks are given reasonable advance notice of the requests for such consent.

      11.12 Enforcement Actions by the Agent. Except as otherwise expressly
provided under this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents and subject
to the terms hereof, Agent will take such action, assert such rights and pursue
such remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Majority
Banks or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall
direct; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to act or omit
to act if, in the judgment of the Agent, such action or omission may expose the
Agent to personal liability or is contrary to this Agreement, any of the other
Loan Documents or applicable law. Except as expressly provided above or
elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, no Bank (other than the
Agent, acting in its capacity as agent) shall be entitled to take any
enforcement action of any kind under any of the Loan Documents.

      12. MISCELLANEOUS

      12.1 Accounting Principles. Where the character or amount of any asset or
liability or item of income or expense is required to be determined or any
consolidation or other accounting computation is required to be made for the
purposes of this Agreement, it shall be done, unless otherwise specified herein,
in accordance with GAAP or SAP, as applicable. Furthermore, all financial
statements required to be delivered hereunder shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP or SAP, as applicable; provided, further, that (i) no change in
accounting principles shall

                                       67
<PAGE>

be made from those used in preparing the financial statements referred to in
Section 6.1 hereof, including, without limitation, with respect to the nature or
classification of accounts, closing proceedings, levels of reserves, or levels
of accruals other than as a result of objective changes in the underlying

Detroit, Michigan, and shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan. Whenever possible each
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be

shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement.

      12.4 Interest. In the event the obligation of Company to pay interest on
the principal balance of the Notes is or becomes in excess of the maximum
interest rate which Company is permitted by law to contract or agree to pay,
giving due consideration to the execution date of this Agreement, then, in that
event, the rate of interest applicable with respect to such Bank's Percentage
shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and all previous

reduction of principal and not of interest.

the Agent for payment of, on demand (a) all reasonable closing costs and
expenses, including, by way of description and not limitation, house and outside

them may incur relative to any payment under any Letter of Credit. All of said
amounts required to be paid by Company, may, at Agent's option, be charged by
Agent as a Prime-based Advance against the Indebtedness.

      12.6 Notices. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement,
all notices and other communications provided to any party hereto under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be in writing and shall be given by

case of telexes and receipt confirmed in the case of telecopies). Agent may, but
shall not be required to, take any action on the basis of any notice given to it
by telephone, but the giver of any such notice shall promptly confirm such
notice in writing or by telex or facsimile, and such notice will not be deemed

control.

            (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
      benefit of Company, the Agent and the Banks, and their respective
      successors and assigns.

            (b) The foregoing shall not authorize any assignment by Company of
      its rights or duties hereunder, and no such assignment shall be made (or
      effective) without the prior written approval of all of the Banks.

            (c) (i) Each of the Banks may at any time and from time to time,
      subject to the terms and conditions hereof, grant participations (but not
      assignments, except as expressly permitted hereunder) in such Bank's
      rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to any
      Person; provided, however, that anything herein to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Company shall not, at any time, be obligated to pay
      under Section 9.1 to any participant any sum in excess of the sum which
      Company would have been obligated to pay to the Bank that was the grantor
      had such grant not been effect. In the event of any such sale by a Bank of
      participating interests to a participant, such Bank's obligations under
      the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely
      responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
      obligations and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with
      such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under the
      Loan Documents. Each Bank shall retain the sole right to approve, without
      the consent of any participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of
      any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification
      or waiver which would require consent of all of the Banks.

                (ii)  Each of the Banks may at any time and from time to time,
                      subject to the terms and conditions hereof, grant
                      assignments in such Bank's rights and obligations
                      hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to any
                      Person; provided, however, that (A) the consent of the
                      Company shall be required prior to an assignment becoming
                      effective unless the assignee is a Bank or an Affiliate of
                      a Bank, and (B) the consent of the Agent shall be required
                      prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the
                      assignee is a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank; provided
                      that the consent of the Company shall not be required if
                      an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Any
                      consent required under this Section 12.8 shall not be
                      unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                (iii) The Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any
                      prospective participant or assignee, once such assignee is
                      approved by Company and Agent (if such approval is
                      required), any and all financial information in such
                      Bank's possession concerning the Company which has been
                      delivered to such Bank pursuant to this Agreement;
                      provided that each such prospective participant shall
                      execute a confidentiality agreement consistent with the
                      terms of Section 12.13, hereof.

            (d) Each assignment by a Bank of any portion of its rights and
      obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be made
      pursuant to an Assignment

                                       70
<PAGE>

      Agreement substantially (as determined by Agent) in the form attached
      hereto as Exhibit "E" (with appropriate insertions acceptable to Agent)
      and shall be subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and to the
      following restrictions:

                  (i)   each assignment shall cover all of the Notes issued by
                        Company hereunder, and shall be for a fixed and not
                        varying percentage thereof, with the same percentage
                        applicable to each such Note;

                  (ii)  each assignment shall be in a minimum amount of Five
                        Million Dollars ($5,000,000);

                  (iii) no assignment shall violate any "blue sky" or other
                        securities law of any jurisdiction or shall require the
                        Company or any other Person to file a registration
                        statement or similar application with the United States
                        Securities and Exchange Commission (or similar state
                        regulatory body) or to qualify under the "blue sky" or
                        other securities laws of any jurisdiction; and

                  (iv)  no assignment shall be effective unless Agent has
                        received from the assignee (or from the assigning Bank)
                        an assignment fee of $3,500 for each such assignment.

In connection with any assignment, Company and Agent shall be entitled to
continue to deal solely and directly with the assigning Bank in connection with
the interest so assigned until (x) the Agent shall have received a notice of
assignment duly executed by the assigning Bank and an Assignment Agreement (with
respect thereto) duly executed by the assigning Bank and each assignee; (y) the
assigning Bank shall have delivered to the Agent the original of each Note held
by the assigning Bank under the Loan Agreements; and (z) the conditions in
Section 12.8(e) have been satisfied. From and after the date on which the Agent
shall notify Company and the assigning Bank that the foregoing conditions shall
have been satisfied and all consents (if any) required shall have been given,
the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to be a party to this Agreement. To the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder shall have been assigned to such
assignee as provided in such notice of assignment (and Assignment Agreement),
such assignee shall have the rights and obligations of the assigning Bank under
this Agreement (including without limitation the right to receive fees payable
hereunder in respect of the period following such assignment); provided,
however, that anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Company shall
not, at any time, be obligated to pay under Section 9.1 to any Bank that is an
assignee or a transferee any sum in excess of the sum which Company would have
been obligated to pay to the Bank that was the assignor or transferor had such
assignment or transfer not been effected. In addition, the assigning Bank, to
the extent that rights and obligations hereunder shall have been assigned by it
as provided in such notice of assignment (and Assignment Agreement), but not
otherwise, shall relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations
under this Agreement.

Within five (5) Business Days following Company's receipt of notice from the
Agent that Agent has accepted and executed a notice of assignment and the duly
executed Assignment Agreement, Company shall, to the extent applicable, execute
and deliver to the Agent in exchange for any

                                       71
<PAGE>

surrendered Note, new Note(s) payable to the order of the assignee in an amount
equal to the amount assigned to it pursuant to such notice of assignment (and
Assignment Agreement), and with respect to the portion of the Indebtedness
retained by the assigning Bank, to the extent applicable, a new Note payable to
the order of the assigning Bank in an amount equal to the amount retained by
such Bank hereunder shall be executed and delivered by the Company. Agent, the
Banks and the Company acknowledge and agree that any such new Note(s) shall be
given in renewal and replacement of the surrendered Notes and shall not effect
or constitute a novation or discharge of the Indebtedness evidenced by any
surrendered Note, and each such new Note shall contain a provision confirming
such agreement.

            (e) Agent shall prepare and distribute to Company and each of the
      Banks a revised Exhibit C to this Agreement setting forth the applicable
      new Percentages of the Banks (including the assignee Bank), taking into
      account such assignment. In addition, Agent shall maintain Exhibit E to
      this Agreement as a register and shall update it from time to time.

            (f) Each Bank agrees that any participation agreement permitted
      hereunder shall comply with all applicable laws and shall be subject to
      the following restrictions (which shall be set forth in the applicable
      Participation Agreement):

                  (i)   such Bank shall remain the holder of its Notes
                        hereunder, notwithstanding any such participation;

                  (ii)  except as expressly set forth in this Section 12.8(f)
                        with respect to rights of setoff and the benefits of
                        Article 10 hereof, a participant shall have no direct
                        rights or remedies hereunder;

                  (iii) a participant shall not reassign or transfer, or grant
                        any sub-participations in its participation interest
                        hereunder or any part thereof; and

                  (iv)  such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility
                        to enforce the obligations of the Company relating to
                        the Notes and Loan Documents, including, without
                        limitation, the right to proceed against any Guaranties,
                        or cause Agent to do so (subject to the terms and
                        conditions hereof), and the right to approve any
                        amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
                        this Agreement without the consent of the participant,
                        except for those matters covered by Section 12.11(a)
                        through (d) and (g) hereof (provided that a participant
                        may exercise approval rights over such matters only on
                        an indirect basis, acting through such Bank, and
                        Company, Agent and the other Banks may continue to deal
                        directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's
                        rights and duties hereunder), and shall otherwise be in
                        form satisfactory to Agent.

Company agrees that each participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff
under Section 9.4 hereof, in respect of its participation interest in amounts
owing under this Agreement and the

                                       72
<PAGE>

Loan Documents to the same extent as if the Indebtedness were owing directly to
it as a Bank under this Agreement, shall be subject to the pro rata recovery
provisions of Section 9.3 hereof, and that each participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of Article 9 hereof. The amount, terms and conditions of any
participation shall be as set forth in the participation agreement between the
issuing Bank and the Person purchasing such participation, and none of the
Company, the Agent and the other Banks shall have any responsibility or
obligation with respect thereto, or to any Person to whom any such participation
may be issued. No such participation shall relieve any issuing Bank of any of
its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and all
actions hereunder shall be conducted as if no such participation had been
granted.

            (g) Nothing in this Agreement, the Loan Documents or the Notes,
      expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer on any Person other
      than the respective parties hereto and thereto and their successors and
      assignees permitted hereunder and thereunder any benefit or any legal or
      equitable right, remedy or other claim under this Agreement, the Notes or
      the other Loan Documents.

      12.9 Indulgence. No delay or failure of Agent and the Banks in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall affect such right, power or
privilege nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any further
exercise thereof, nor the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights of Agent and the Banks hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of
any rights or remedies which Agent and the Banks would otherwise have.

      12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, and each executed copy shall constitute an original instrument,
but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

      12.11 Amendment and Waiver. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by Company
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Majority Banks or, if this Agreement expressly so requires
with respect to the subject matter thereof, by all Banks (and, with respect to
any amendments to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, by Company), and
then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Banks, do any
of the following: (a) subject the Banks to any additional obligations, (b)
reduce the principal of, or the rate or amount of interest on, the Revolving
Credit Notes or any Fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (c) postpone any
date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Revolving Credit
Notes or any Fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) waive any Event of
Default specified in Sections 8.1(a) hereof, (e) release any material Guarantor
or terminate or modify any indemnity provided to the Banks hereunder or under
the Loan Documents, except as shall be otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement or any Loan Document, (f) release all or substantially all of the
Collateral from the Liens granted to Agent for the benefit of the Banks pursuant
to the Loan Documents; (g) modify, amend or waive any of the provisions of
Sections 6.15 through 6.19, Section 7.3 or Section 7.4 hereof, (h) take any
action which requires the signing of all Banks pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or any Loan Document, (i) change the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the Notes which shall be required for the Banks or any

                                       73
<PAGE>

of them to take any action under this Agreement or any Loan Document or (j)
change the definition of "Majority Banks" or "Percentage" or this Section 12.11.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless
in writing signed by the Swing Line Bank, do any of the following: (x) reduce
the principal of, or interest on, the Swing Line Note or (y) postpone any date
fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Swing Line Note; (B)
no amendment, waiver, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Issuing Bank, affect the rights or duties of the Issuing Bank under Article 3
hereof and (C) no amendment, waiver, or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the Agent in addition to all the Banks, affect the rights or duties of
the Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. All references in
this Agreement to "Banks" or "the Banks" shall refer to all Banks, unless
expressly stated to refer to Majority Banks.

      12.12 Taxes and Fees. Should any documentary, stamp or similar tax (other
than an Excluded Tax of any Bank or Agent imposed by the jurisdiction in which
such Bank or Agent have their respective principal executive offices), or
recording or filing fee become payable in respect of this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents (or the execution, filing or recording thereof) or any
amendment, modification or supplement hereof or thereof, Company agrees to pay
the same together with any interest or penalties thereon and agrees to hold the
Agent and the Banks harmless with respect thereto.

      12.13 Confidentiality. The Agent and each Bank agree that it will not
disclose without the prior consent of Company (other than to its employees, its
Affiliates, to Agent or another Bank or to its auditors or counsel) any
information with respect to Company, which is furnished pursuant to this
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents; provided that Agent and any Bank may
disclose any such information (a) as has become generally available to the
public or has been lawfully obtained by Agent or such Bank from any third party
under no duty of confidentiality to Company, (b) as may be required in any
report, statement or testimony submitted to, or in respect to any inquiry, by,
any municipal, state or federal regulatory body having or claiming to have
jurisdiction over such Bank, including the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System of the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar organizations
(whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors, (c) as may be
required in respect to any summons or subpoena or in connection with any
litigation, (d) in order to comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling
applicable to such Bank, and (e) to any permitted transferee or assignee or to
any approved participant of, or with respect to, the Notes, as aforesaid.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, confidential information shall
not include, and each Bank (and each employee, representative or other agent of
any Bank) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind,
the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby
and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are or have been provided to such Bank relating to such tax treatment or tax
structure; provided that, with respect to any document or similar item that in
either case contains information concerning such tax treatments or tax structure
of the transactions contemplated hereby as well as other information, this
sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that
relate to such tax treatment or tax structure.

                                       74

      12.14 Withholding Taxes. If any Bank is not a united states person within
the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code such Bank shall
promptly (but in any event prior to the initial payment of interest hereunder)
deliver to the Agent two executed copies of (i) Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN or any successor form specifying the applicable tax treaty between the
United States and the jurisdiction of such Bank's domicile which provides for
the exemption from withholding on interest payments to such Bank, (ii) Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or any successor form evidencing that the income to
be received by such Bank hereunder is effectively connected with the conduct of
a trade or business in the United States or (iii) other evidence satisfactory to
the Agent that such Bank is exempt from United States income tax withholding
with respect to such income; provided, however, that such Bank shall not be
required to deliver to Agent the aforesaid forms or other evidence with respect
to Advances to the Company, if such Bank has assigned its entire interest in the
Revolving Credit (including any outstanding Advances thereunder and
participations in Letters of Credit issued hereunder), Swing Line and any Notes
issued to it by the Company, to an Affiliate which is incorporated under the
laws of the United States or a state thereof, and so notifies the Agent. Such
Bank shall amend or supplement any such form or evidence as required to insure
that it is accurate, complete and non-misleading at all times. Promptly upon
notice from the Agent of any determination by the Internal Revenue Service that
any payments previously made to such Bank hereunder were subject to United
States income tax withholding when made, such Bank shall pay to the Agent the
excess of the aggregate amount required to be withheld from such payments over
the aggregate amount actually withheld by the Agent. In addition, from time to
time upon the reasonable request and at the sole expense of the Company, each
Bank and the Agent shall (to the extent it is able to do so based upon
applicable facts and circumstances), complete and provide the Company with such
forms, certificates or other documents as may be reasonably necessary to allow
the Company, as applicable, to make any payment under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents without any withholding for or on the account of any tax
under Section 10.1(d) hereof (or with such withholding at a reduced rate),
provided that the execution and delivery of such forms, certificates or other
documents does not adversely affect or otherwise restrict the right and benefits
(including without limitation economic benefits) available to such of the Bank
or the Agent, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, or under or in connection with any transactions not related to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTION OF ANY OF THEM. NEITHER THE
BANKS, THE AGENT, NOR COMPANY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE, BY COUNTERCLAIM OR
OTHERWISE, ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER
ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. THESE PROVISIONS
SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN ANY RESPECT OR RELINQUISHED BY THE
BANKS AND THE AGENT OR COMPANY EXCEPT BY A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT EXECUTED BY ALL OF
THEM.

      12.17 Complete Agreement; Conflicts. This Agreement, the Notes, any
Requests for Revolving Credit Advance, and the Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto, superseding all prior agreements, discussions
and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof, and none of the
parties shall be bound by anything not expressed in writing. In the event of any
conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, this
Agreement shall govern.

      12.18 Severability. In case any one or more of the obligations of Company
under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining obligations of Company shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, and such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability in one jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of the obligations of Company under this Agreement, the Notes or

headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for convenience of reference

      12.21 Independence of Covenants. Each covenant hereunder shall be given
independent effect (subject to any exceptions stated in such covenant) so that
if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any such covenant
(taking into account any such stated exception), the fact that it would be
permitted by an exception to, or would be otherwise within the limitations of,
another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default.

Gentlemen and Ladies:

      Reference is made to Section 12.8(c), (d), (e) and (f) of the Agreement.
Unless otherwise defined herein or the context otherwise requires, all initially
capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings
specified in the Agreement.

      This Agreement constitutes notice to each of you of the proposed
assignment and delegation by [insert assignor Bank] (the "Assignor") to [insert
proposed assignee] (the "Assignee") of a _____% undivided interest ("Assigned
Percentage") in Assignor's Revolving Credit Note under the Agreement (the
"Note"), such that after giving effect to the assignment and assumption
hereafter provided the Assignee's aggregate principal interest in the Notes
shall equal $________________* and its Percentage shall equal ____% under the
Loan Documents.

      The Assignor hereby instructs the Agent to make all payments from and
including the "Effective Date" (as hereafter defined) hereof in respect of the
interest assigned hereby, directly to the Assignee. The Assignor and the
Assignee agree that all interest and fees accrued up to, but not including, the
Effective Date of the assignment and delegation being made hereby are the
property of the Assignor, and not the Assignee. The Assignee agrees that, upon
receipt of any such interest or fees accrued up to the Effective Date, the
Assignee will promptly remit the same to the Assignor.

      The Assignee hereby confirms that it has received a copy of the Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules referred to therein, and all other Loan Documents
which it considers necessary, together with copies of the other documents which
were required to be delivered under the Agreement as a condition to the making
of the loans thereunder. The Assignee acknowledges and agrees that it: (a) has
made and will continue to make such inquiries and has taken and will take such
care on its own behalf as would have been the case had its Percentage been
granted and its loans been made directly by such Assignee to the Company without
the

<PAGE>

intervention of the Agent, the Assignor or any other bank; and (b) has made and
will continue to make, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the
Assignor or any other bank, and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, its own credit analysis and decisions relating to the
Agreement. The Assignee further acknowledges and agrees that neither the Agent,
nor the Assignor has made any representations or warranties about the
creditworthiness of the Company, or any other party to the Agreement or any
other of the Loan Documents, or with respect to the legality, validity,
sufficiency or enforceability of the Agreement, or any other of the Loan
Documents. This assignment shall be made without recourse to or warranty by the
Assignor, except as set forth herein.

      Assignee represents and warrants that it is a Person to which assignments
are permitted pursuant to Section 12.8(c) of the Agreement. Assignor and
Assignee represent and warrant that this assignment shall not violate any "blue
sky" or other securities law of any jurisdiction or require the Company or any
other Person to file a registration statement with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission or apply to qualify any loans or any interest in any
thereof, under the "blue sky" or other securities laws of any jurisdiction.

      Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, effective as of the
Effective Date:

            (a) the Assignee: (i) shall be deemed automatically to have become a
      party to the Agreement, to have assumed all of the Assignor's obligations
      thereunder to the extent of the Assignee's percentage referred to in the
      second paragraph of this Assignment Agreement, and to have all the rights
      and obligations of a party to the Agreement, as if it were the Assignor to
      the extent specified in the second paragraph hereof; and (ii) agrees to be
      bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement as if it were
      an original signatory thereto; and

            (b) the Assignor's obligations under the Agreement shall be reduced
      by the Assigned Percentage.

      As used herein, the term "Effective Date" means the date on which all of
the following have occurred or have been completed, as reasonably determined by
the Agent:

            (1) the delivery to the Agent of an original of this Assignment
      Agreement executed by the Assignor and the Assignee;

            (2) the payment to the Agent, of all accrued fees, expenses and
      other items for which reimbursement is then owing under the Agreement;

            (3) the payment to the Agent of the $3,500 processing fee referred
      to in Section 12.8(d) (iv) of the Agreement; and

            (4) all other restrictions and items noted in Sections 12.8(c), (d),
      (e) and (f) of the Agreement have been satisfied.

      The Agent shall notify the Assignor and the Assignee of the Effective
Date.
