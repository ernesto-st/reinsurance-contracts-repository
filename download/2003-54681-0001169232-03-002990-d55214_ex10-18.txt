                           SECTION 1. CREDIT FACILITY

      Subject to the terms and conditions of, and in reliance upon the
representations and warranties made in, this Agreement and the other Loan

available to Borrowers upon Borrower Representative's request therefor, as

      1.1 Loans.

            1.1.1 Revolving Credit Loans.

                  (a) U.S. Revolver. Each Lender (except the U.K. Lender and
      Canadian Lender) agrees, severally and not jointly, for so long as no
      Default or Event of Default exists, to make Revolving Credit Loans to U.S.
      Borrower (each such loan or extension of credit, a "U.S. Revolving Credit
      Loan") from time to time during the period from the date hereof to but not
      including the last day of the Term, as requested by Borrower
      Representative, on behalf of U.S. Borrower, in the manner set forth in
      subsection 3.1.1 hereof, up to a maximum principal amount in Dollar
      Equivalents at any time outstanding equal to the lesser of (i) the product
      of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage and the U.S. Revolving Loan
      Commitment minus the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage
      and the U.S. LC Obligations and (ii) the product of


<PAGE>

      such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage and an amount equal to the U.S.
      Borrowing Base at such time minus the product of such Lender's Revolving
      Loan Percentage and any amount equal to the U.S. LC Obligations. The U.S.
      Revolving Credit Loans made by the Lenders for the benefit of U.S.
      Borrower shall be denominated in Dollars. The U.S. Revolving Credit Loans
      shall be repayable in accordance with the terms of the U.S. Revolving
      Notes and shall be secured by all of the U.S. Collateral.

                  (b) U.K. Revolving Loans. As of the U.K. Effective Date, U.K.
      Lender agrees, for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to
      make revolving credit loans and extensions of credit under an overdraft
      sub-facility to U.K. Borrower (each such loan or extension of credit, a
      "U.K. Revolving Credit Loan") from time to time during the period from the
      date hereof to but not including the last day of the Term, as requested by
      Borrower Representative, on behalf of U.K. Borrower, in the manner set
      forth in subsection 3.1.1 hereof, up to a maximum principal amount at any
      time outstanding in Dollar Equivalents equal to the lesser of (i) the U.K.
      Sublimit minus the Dollar Equivalent of the U.K. LC Obligations and (ii)
      an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the U.K. Borrowing Base at
      such time minus the Dollar Equivalent of the U.K. LC Obligations. The U.K.
      Revolving Credit Loans made by U.K. Lender to U.K. Borrower shall be
      denominated in Sterling or Euros. The U.K. Revolving Credit Loans shall be
      repayable in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Notes and shall be
      secured by all of the U.K. Collateral and Canadian Collateral.

                  (c) Canadian Revolving Credit Loans. As of the Canadian
      Effective Date, Canadian Lender agrees, for so long as no Default or Event
      of Default exists, to make Revolving Credit Loans to Canadian Borrower
      (each such loan or extension of credit, a "Canadian Revolving Credit
      Loan") from time to time during the period from the date hereof to but not
      including the last day of the Term, as requested by Borrower
      Representative, on behalf of Canadian Borrower, in the manner set forth in
      subsection 3.1.1 hereof, up to a maximum principal amount at any time
      outstanding in Dollar Equivalents equal to the lesser of (i) the Canadian
      Sublimit minus the Dollar Equivalent of the Canadian LC Obligations and
      (ii) an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the Canadian Borrowing
      Base at such time minus the Dollar Equivalent of the Canadian LC
      Obligations. The Canadian Revolving Credit Loans made by Canadian Lender
      for the benefit of Canadian Borrowers shall be denominated in Canadian
      Dollars. The Canadian Revolving Credit Loans shall be repayable in
      accordance with the terms of the Revolving Notes and shall be secured by
      all of the Collateral.

                  (d) Aggregate Revolving Loans. Notwithstanding anything in
      subsection 1.1.1(a), (b), and (c) to the contrary, no Lender shall make
      Revolving Credit Loans to Borrowers if the Dollar Equivalent of the
      Revolving Credit Loans outstanding advanced by that Lender after taking
      into account the Dollar Equivalent of the contemplated Revolving Credit
      Loan would exceed the lesser of (i) such Lender's Revolving Loan
      Commitment minus the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage
      and the LC Obligations and (ii) except as provided in subsections 1.1.2
      and 1.1.5, the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage and an
      amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the Aggregate Borrowing Base at
      such time minus the Dollar Equivalent of the LC Amount.


                                       2

                  (e) Canadian and U.K. Sublimit. Although Canadian Revolving
      Credit Loans will be funded in Canadian Dollars and U.K. Revolving Credit
      Loans will be funded in Sterling or Euros, the Canadian Sublimit and U.K.
      Sublimit are denominated in Dollars. As of the Closing Date, the Canadian
      Sublimit and U.K. Sublimit are allocated as set forth below:

            Canadian Sublimit                       $12,000,000

            U.K. Sublimit                           $11,000,000

                  (f) Euro Sublimit. U.K. Lender shall not be required to fund
      U.K. Revolving Credit Loans in Euros or issue or cause to be issued U.K.
      Letters of Credit denominated in Euros if the Dollar Equivalent of the
      aggregate principal amount of the U.K. Revolving Credit Loans funded or to
      be funded in Euros and the undrawn available amount of outstanding U.K.
      Letters of Credit issued or to be issued and denominated in Euros exceeds
      $1,000,000.

            1.1.2 Overadvances. Insofar as Borrower Representative may request
and Agent or Majority Lenders (as provided below) may be willing in their sole
and absolute discretion to make Revolving Credit Loans to the respective
Borrowers as to which they have Revolving Loan Commitments at a time when the
unpaid balance of Revolving Credit Loans plus the sum of the LC Amount plus the
amount of LC Obligations that have not been reimbursed by Borrowers or funded
with a Revolving Credit Loan, exceeds, or would exceed with the making of any
such Revolving Credit Loan or the incurrence of any LC Obligation, the Aggregate
Borrowing Base (any such Loan or Loans being herein referred to individually as
an "Overadvance" and collectively, as "Overadvances"), Agents shall enter such
Overadvances as debits in the applicable Loan Account. All Overadvances shall be
repaid on demand, shall be secured by the Collateral (provided that Overadvances
to U.S. Borrower shall only be secured by the U.S. Collateral) and shall bear
interest as provided in this Agreement for Base Rate Portions of Revolving
Credit Loans (for the applicable Borrower) generally. Any Overadvance made
pursuant to the terms hereof shall be made to the respective Borrowers: (i) with
respect to Overadvances to U.S. Borrower, by all Lenders (except the U.K. Lender
and the Canadian Lender) ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving
Loan Percentages, (ii) with respect to Overadvances to U.K. Borrower, by the
U.K. Lender, ratably with respect to the U.K. Lender and, following a refunding
under Section 3.14, the U.K. Participants and (iii) with respect to Overadvances
to the Canadian Borrower, by the Canadian Lender, ratably with respect to the
Canadian Lender and, following a refunding under Section 3.13, the Canadian
Participants. Overadvances in the aggregate amount of the Dollar Equivalent of
$1,000,000 or less may, unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, be made in the sole and absolute discretion of Agent. Overadvances
in an aggregate amount of more than the Dollar Equivalent of $1,000,000 but less
than the Dollar Equivalent of $2,500,000 may, unless a Default or an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, be made in the sole and absolute
discretion of the Majority Lenders. Overadvances in an aggregate amount of the
Dollar Equivalent of $2,500,000 or more and Overadvances to be made after the
occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or an Event of Default shall
require the consent of all Lenders. The foregoing notwithstanding, in no event,
unless otherwise consented to by all Lenders, (w) shall


                                       3
<PAGE>

any Overadvances be outstanding for more than 60 consecutive days, (x) after all
outstanding Overadvances have been repaid, shall Agents or Lenders make any
additional Overadvances unless 60 days or more have expired since the last date
on which any Overadvances were outstanding, (y) shall Overadvances be
outstanding on more than 90 days within any one 180 day period or (z) shall
Agents make Revolving Credit Loans on behalf of Lenders under this subsection
1.1.2 to the extent such Revolving Credit Loans would cause a Lender's share of
the Revolving Credit Loans to exceed such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment
minus such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage of the LC Amount.

            1.1.3 Use of Proceeds. The Revolving Credit Loans shall be used
solely for (i) the satisfaction of existing Indebtedness of Borrowers to
Banker's Trust Company and Borrowers' other existing senior lenders; (ii)
Borrowers' general operating capital needs including, but not limited to,
Capital Expenditures, in a manner consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement and all applicable laws; (iii) the repurchase of Contico Preferred
Units pursuant to the Contico Preferred Unit Repurchase Agreement; (iv) the
making of intercompany loans to any other Loan Party (other than Holdings) in
accordance with subsection 7.2.2 for their own general operating capital needs
in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and all applicable
laws; and (v) other purposes permitted under this Agreement.

            1.1.4 Swingline Loans. In order to reduce the frequency of transfers
of funds from Lenders to Agent for making Revolving Credit Loans and for so long
as no Default or Event of Default exists, Agent shall be permitted (but not
required) to make Revolving Credit Loans to U.S. Borrower upon request by
Borrower Representative (such Revolving Credit Loans to be designated as
"Swingline Loans") provided that the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans
outstanding at any time will not (i) exceed $5,000,000; (ii) when added to the
principal amount of Agent's other Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding plus
Agent's Revolving Loan Percentage of the LC Amount, exceed Agent's Revolving
Credit Commitment; or (iii) when added to the principal amount of all other
Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding plus the LC Amount, exceed the U.S.
Borrowing Base. Within the foregoing limits, U.S. Borrower may borrow, repay and
reborrow Swingline Loans. All Swingline Loans shall be treated as Revolving
Credit Loans for purposes of this Agreement, except that (a) all Swingline Loans
shall be Base Rate Revolving Portions and (b) notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary (other than as set forth in the next succeeding sentence), all
principal and interest paid with respect to Swingline Loans shall be for the
sole account of Agent in its capacity as the lender of Swingline Loans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not more than 2 Business Days after (1) Lenders
receive notice from Agent that a Swingline Loan has been advanced in respect of
a drawing under a Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty or (2) in any other
circumstance, demand is made by Agent during the continuance of an Event of
Default, each Lender shall irrevocably and unconditionally purchase and receive
from Agent, without recourse or warranty from Agent, an undivided interest and
participation in each Swingline Loan to the extent of such Lender's Revolving
Loan Percentage thereof, by paying to Agent, in same day funds, an amount equal
to such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage of such Swingline Loan.

            1.1.5 Agent Loans. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, each Agent, in its sole discretion, may make Revolving
Credit Loans to the Borrowers to which it has a Revolving Loan Commitment on
behalf of the applicable Lender(s) (to (i) U.S. Borrower, in Dollars, (ii) U.K.
Borrower, in Sterling or Euros and (iii) Canadian


                                       4

Borrower, in Canadian Dollars), so long as the aggregate amount of such
Revolving Credit Loans shall not exceed the Dollar Equivalent of $2,500,000, if
Agents, in their reasonable business judgment, deem that such Revolving Credit
Loans are necessary or desirable (i) to protect all or any portion of the
Collateral, (ii) to enhance the likelihood, or maximize the amount of, repayment
of the Loans and the other Obligations, or (iii) to pay any other amount
chargeable to any Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, including without
limitation costs, fees and expenses as described in Sections 2.9 and 2.10 (such
Revolving Credit Loans, hereinafter, "Agent Loans"); provided that (a) in no
event shall the maximum principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and the
LC Obligations exceed the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments and (b) any
Revolving Credit Loans made to protect all or any portion of the Canadian
Collateral or the U.K. Collateral shall not be made to U.S. Borrower. Each
applicable Lender shall be obligated to advance to the applicable Borrower its
Revolving Loan Percentage of each Agent Loan made in accordance with this
subsection 1.1.5. If Agent Loans are made in accordance with the preceding
sentence, then (a) the Aggregate Borrowing Base and the U.K. Borrowing Base,
U.S. Borrowing Base or Canadian Borrowing Base, as applicable, shall be deemed
increased by the amount of such permitted Agent Loans, but only for so long as
Agents allow such Agent Loans to be outstanding, and (b) all Lenders shall be
bound to make, or permit to remain outstanding, such Agent Loans based upon
their Revolving Loan Percentages in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
All Agent Loans shall be repaid on demand, shall be secured by the Collateral
(provided that Agent Loans to U.S. Borrower shall only be secured by the U.S.
Collateral) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate as provided in this
Agreement for Base Rate Portions of Revolving Credit Loans (for the applicable
Borrower) generally.

      1.2 Letters of Credit; LC Guaranties.

                  (a) U.S. Letters of Credit; U.S. LC Guaranties. Agent agrees,
      for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists and if requested by
      Borrower Representative on behalf of U.S. Borrower, to (i) issue or cause
      to be issued by Bank or another Affiliate of Agent, on the date requested
      by Borrower Representative, U.S. Letters of Credit for the account of any
      U.S. Loan Party or (ii) execute U.S. LC Guaranties by which Agent, Bank,
      or another Affiliate of Agent, on the date requested by Borrower
      Representative, shall guaranty the payment or performance by U.S. Loan
      Parties of their reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of
      credit and letters of credit issued for any U.S. Loan Party's account by
      other Persons in support of such U.S. Loan Party's obligations (other than
      obligations for the repayment of Money Borrowed); provided that the U.S.
      LC Obligations shall not exceed $15,000,000 at any time. Such U.S. Letters
      of Credit and U.S. LC Guaranties shall be denominated in Dollars or such
      other currency as consented to by Agent in its sole discretion. Unless
      otherwise consented to by Agent, no U.S. Letter of Credit or U.S. LC
      Guaranty that is a (i) standby letter of credit shall have an expiration
      date greater than one year from the date of issuance (provided that any
      standby letter of credit with a one-year term may provide for the
      customary evergreen renewals thereof for additional one-year periods
      (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in the
      immediately succeeding sentence, unless cash-collateralized to Agent's
      satisfaction)) or (ii) documentary letter of credit shall have an
      expiration date greater than 180 days from the date of issuance.
      Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, no U.S. Letter of
      Credit or U.S. LC Guaranty may have an expiration date after the last day
      of the Term, unless cash-


                                       5
<PAGE>

      collateralized to Agent's satisfaction. Notwithstanding anything to the
      contrary contained herein, U.S. Borrower, Agent and Lenders hereby agree
      that all U.S. LC Obligations and all obligations of U.S. Borrower relating
      thereto shall be satisfied by the prompt issuance of one or more Revolving
      Credit Loans in Dollars to U.S. Borrower that are Base Rate Portions,
      which U.S. Borrower hereby acknowledges are requested and Lenders hereby
      agree to fund. In the event that Revolving Credit Loans to U.S. Borrower
      are not, for any reason, promptly made to satisfy all then existing U.S.
      LC Obligations, each Lender hereby agrees to pay to Agent, on demand, an
      amount equal to such U.S. LC Obligations multiplied by such Lender's
      Revolving Loan Percentage, and until so paid, such amount shall be secured
      by the U.S. Collateral and shall bear interest and be payable at the same
      rate and in the same manner as Base Rate Portions for Revolving Credit
      Loans to U.S. Borrower. Immediately upon the issuance of a U.S. Letter of
      Credit or a U.S. LC Guaranty under this Agreement, each Lender shall be
      deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from
      Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and
      participation therein equal to the amount of such U.S. Letter of Credit or
      U.S. LC Guaranty multiplied by such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage.
      The form of any U.S. Letter of Credit, U.K. Letter of Credit or Canadian
      Letter of Credit shall be reasonably acceptable to Agent and Borrower
      Representative. U.S. Letters of Credit, U.K. Letters of Credit and
      Canadian Letters of Credit shall be issued in accordance with the Uniform
      Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits then in effect and adopted by
      Bank (with respect to U.S. Letters of Credit), Fleet U.K. (with respect to
      U.K. Letters of Credit) or Fleet Canada (with respect to Canadian Letters
      of Credit).

                  (b) U.K. Letters of Credit; U.K. LC Guaranties. As of the U.K.
      Effective Date, U.K. Agent will cause Fleet U.K., and Fleet U.K. agrees,
      for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists and if requested by
      Borrower Representative on behalf of any U.K. Loan Party, to issue its, or
      cause an Affiliate of Fleet U.K. to issue, on the date requested by
      Borrower Representative, U.K. Letters of Credit for the account of a U.K.
      Borrower in support of such U.K. Loan Party's obligations (other than
      obligations for the repayment of Money Borrowed); provided that the U.K.
      LC Obligations shall not exceed the Dollar Equivalent of $500,000 at any
      time and all U.K. Letters of Credit and U.K. LC Guaranties shall be
      denominated in Sterling or Euros. Unless otherwise consented to by Agent,
      no U.K. Letter of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty that is a (i) standby letter
      of credit shall have an expiration date greater than one year from the
      date of issuance (provided that any standby letter of credit with a
      one-year term may provide for customary evergreen renewals (which shall in
      no event extend beyond the date referred to in the immediately succeeding
      sentence, unless cash-collateralized to Agent's satisfaction)) or (ii)
      documentary letter of credit shall have an expiration date greater than
      180 days from the date of issuance. Notwithstanding anything else herein
      to the contrary, no U.K. Letter of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty may have an
      expiration date after the last day of the Term, unless cash-collateralized
      to Agent's satisfaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
      contained herein, U.K. Borrower and U.K. Lender hereby agree that all U.K.
      LC Obligations and all obligations of U.K. Borrower relating thereto shall
      be satisfied by the prompt issuance of one or more Revolving Credit Loans
      to U.K. Borrower that are Base Rate Portions, which U.K. Borrower hereby
      acknowledges are requested and U.K. Lender hereby agrees to fund. If the
      draw on the underlying U.K. Letter of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty is paid
      in Sterling, the applicable Revolving Credit Loan shall be in Sterling. If
      the draw amount on the underlying U.K.


                                       6
<PAGE>

      Letter of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty is paid in Euros, the applicable
      Revolving Credit Loan shall be in Euros. In the event that Revolving
      Credit Loans to U.K. Borrower is not, for any reason, promptly made to
      satisfy all then existing U.K. LC Obligations, U.K. Lender hereby agrees
      to pay to U.K. Agent, on demand, an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent
      of such U.K. LC Obligations (paid in the currency of such U.K. LC
      Obligations), and until so paid, such amount shall be secured by the
      Collateral and shall bear interest and be payable at the same rate and in
      the same manner as Base Rate Portions for Revolving Credit Loans to U.K.
      Borrower. Immediately upon the issuance of a U.K. Letter of Credit or a
      U.K. LC Guaranty under this Agreement, each U.K. Participant shall be
      deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from
      U.K. Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and
      participation therein equal to such U.K. LC Amount and the Dollar
      Equivalent of the U.K. LC Guaranty.

                  (c) Canadian Letters of Credit; Canadian LC Guaranties. As of
      the Canadian Effective Date, Canadian Agent will cause Fleet Canada, and
      Fleet Canada agrees, for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists
      and if requested by Borrower Representative on behalf of any Canadian Loan
      Party, to (i) issue its, or cause an Affiliate of Fleet Canada that is not
      a non-resident of Canada for purposes of the ITA to issue, on the date
      requested by Borrower Representative, Canadian Letters of Credit for the
      account of Canadian Borrowers or (ii) execute Canadian LC Guaranties by
      which Fleet Canada or an Affiliate of Fleet Canada, on the date requested
      by Borrower Representative, shall guaranty the payment or performance by
      Canadian Borrower of its reimbursement obligations with respect to letters
      of credit and letters of credit issued for Canadian Loan Parties' account
      by other Persons in support of a Canadian Loan Party's obligations (other
      than obligations for the repayment of Money Borrowed); provided that the
      Canadian LC Obligations shall not exceed the Dollar Equivalent of $500,000
      at any time and all Canadian Letters of Credit and Canadian LC Guaranties
      shall be denominated in Canadian Dollars. Unless otherwise consented to by
      Agent, no Canadian Letter of Credit or Canadian LC Guaranty that is a (i)
      standby letter of credit shall have an expiration date greater than one
      year from the date of issuance (provided that any standby letter of credit
      with a one-year term may provide for customary evergreen renewals (which
      shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in the immediately
      succeeding sentence, unless cash-collateralized to Agent's satisfaction))
      or (ii) documentary letter of credit shall have an expiration date greater
      than 180 days from the date of issuance. Notwithstanding anything else
      herein to the contrary, no Canadian Letter of Credit or Canadian LC
      Guaranty may have an expiration date after the last day of the Term,
      unless cash-collateralized to Agent's satisfaction. Notwithstanding
      anything to the contrary contained herein, Canadian Borrower and Canadian
      Lender hereby agree that all Canadian LC Obligations and all obligations
      of Canadian Loan Parties relating thereto shall be satisfied by the prompt
      issuance of one or more Revolving Credit Loans to Canadian Borrower that
      are Base Rate Portions, which Canadian Borrower hereby acknowledges are
      requested and Canadian Lender hereby agrees to fund. In the event that
      Revolving Credit Loans to Canadian Borrower are not, for any reason,
      promptly made to satisfy all then existing Canadian LC Obligations,
      Canadian Lender hereby agrees to pay to Canadian Agent, on demand, an
      amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent


                                       7
<PAGE>

      of such Canadian LC Obligations (paid in the currency of such Canadian LC
      Obligations), and until so paid, such amount shall be secured by the
      Collateral and shall bear interest and be payable at the same rate and in
      the same manner as Base Rate Portions for Revolving Credit Loans to
      Canadian Borrower. Immediately upon the issuance of a Canadian Letter of
      Credit or a Canadian LC Guaranty under this Agreement, each Canadian
      Participant shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally
      purchased and received from Canadian Agent, without recourse or warranty,
      an undivided interest and participation therein equal to such Canadian LC
      Amount and the Dollar Equivalent of the Canadian LC Guaranty.

                  (d) LC Amount. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
      contrary, the Dollar Equivalent of the LC Amount shall not exceed the
      lesser of (i) Aggregate Availability or (ii) $16,000,000 at any time.

      1.3 Guarantees; Limitations on U.K. Borrower's and Canadian Borrower's
Liability.

                  (a) U.S. Borrower hereby absolutely and unconditionally
      guarantees to Agents and each Lender and their respective successors and
      assigns, the full and prompt payment (whether at stated maturity, by
      acceleration or otherwise) and performance of the Obligations of U.K.
      Borrower and Canadian Borrower hereunder and under all Loan Documents. As
      of the U.K. Effective Date, U.K. Borrower hereby absolutely and
      unconditionally guarantees to Agents and each Lender and their respective
      successors and assigns, the full and prompt payment (whether at stated
      maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of the Obligations
      of Canadian Borrower hereunder and under all Loan Documents. As of the
      Canadian Effective Date, Canadian Borrower hereby absolutely and
      unconditionally guarantees to Agents and each Lender and their respective
      successors and assigns, the full and prompt payment (whether at stated
      maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of the Obligations
      of U.K. Borrower hereunder and under all Loan Documents. Notwithstanding
      any provision herein to the contrary, U.K. Borrower and Canadian Borrower
      shall have no liability, direct or indirect, for the Obligations of U.S.
      Borrower hereunder or under any Loan Documents.

                  (b) Each Borrower agrees that its guaranty obligation under
      Section 1.3(a) hereof is a continuing guaranty of payment and performance
      and not of collection, that its obligations under this Section 1.3 shall
      not be discharged until payment and performance, in full, of the
      Obligations has occurred, and that its obligations under this Section 1.3
      shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and unaffected by,

                  (i) the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability or
            any future amendment of, or change in, this Agreement, or any other
            Loan Document (including any provision hereof or thereof) or any
            other agreement, document or instrument to which any other Borrower
            of the Obligations is or may become a party;


                                       8
<PAGE>

                  (ii) the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement or
            any other Loan Document or the waiver or consent by Agents and any
            Lender with respect to any of the provisions thereof;

                  (iii) the existence, value or condition of, or failure to
            perfect its Lien against, any security for the Obligations or any
            action, or the absence of any action, by Agents and Lenders in
            respect thereof (including the release of any such security);

                  (iv) the insolvency of any Borrower of the Obligations; or

                  (v) any other action or circumstances that might otherwise
            constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or
            guarantor.

                  Subject to the last sentence of Section 1.3(a), each Borrower
      shall be regarded, and shall be in the same position, as principal debtor
      with respect to the Obligations of the other Borrowers guaranteed
      hereunder.

                  (c) Each Borrower expressly waives all rights it may have now
      or in the future under any statute, or at common law, or at law or in
      equity, or otherwise, to compel Agents or Lenders to marshal assets or to
      proceed in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder against any
      other Borrower, any other party or against any security for the payment
      and performance of the Obligations before proceeding against, or as a
      condition to proceeding against, any of the other Borrowers. Each Borrower
      also expressly waives the benefits of division and discussion under the
      Civil Code of Quebec. It is agreed among Borrowers, Agents and Lenders
      that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of the transaction
      contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and that, but
      for the provisions of this Section 1.3 and such waivers, Agents and
      Lenders would decline to enter into this Agreement.

                  (d) Subject to the last sentence of Section 1.3(a) and
      notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other
      Loan Document, each Borrower agrees that the provisions of this Section
      1.3 are for the benefit of Agents and Lenders and their respective
      successors, transferees, endorsees and assigns, and nothing herein
      contained shall impair, as among Borrowers and Agents or Lenders, the
      obligations of the other Borrowers under the Loan Documents.

                  (e) Subject to the last sentence of Section 1.3(a) and
      notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other
      Loan Document, each Borrower hereby expressly and irrevocably subordinates
      all rights at law or in equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
      contribution, indemnification or set off and any and all defenses
      available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor until the
      payment in full of all Obligations and the termination of the Revolving
      Loan Commitments. Borrowers acknowledge and agree that this subordination
      is intended to benefit Agents and Lenders, and their respective successors
      and assigns, and shall not limit or otherwise affect their liability
      hereunder or the enforceability of this Section 1.3,


                                       9
<PAGE>

      and that Agents, Lenders and their respective successors and assigns are
      intended third party beneficiaries of the subordinations and agreements
      set forth in this Section 1.3.

                  (f) If Agents or any Lender may, under applicable law, proceed
      to realize their benefits under any of the Loan Documents giving Agents or
      such Lender a Lien upon any Collateral, whether owned by any Borrower or
      by any other Person, either by judicial foreclosure or sale or by
      non-judicial sale or enforcement, Agents or any Lender may, at their sole
      option, determine which of its remedies or rights it may pursue without
      affecting any of its rights and remedies under this Section 1.3. If, in
      the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Agents or any Lender shall
      forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a
      deficiency judgment against any Borrower or any other Person, whether
      because of any applicable laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or the
      like, each Borrower hereby consents to such action by such of the Agents
      or such Lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even if such
      action by Agents or such Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of
      any rights of subrogation that each Borrower might otherwise have had but
      for such action by such of the Agents or such Lender. Any election of
      remedies that results in the denial or impairment of the right of Agents
      or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall
      not, subject to the last sentence of Section 1.3(a), impair any other
      Borrower's obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations. In the
      event Agents or any Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee's or
      receiver's sale or at any private sale permitted by law or the Loan
      Documents, Agents or such Lender may bid all or less than the amount of
      the Obligations and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Agents or
      such Lender but shall be credited against the Obligations. The amount of
      the successful bid at any such sale, whether Agent or any Lender or other
      party is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the
      fair market value of the Collateral and the difference between such bid
      amount and the remaining balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively
      deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guaranteed under this Section
      1.3, notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision or
      ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim
      to which Agents or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such
      bidding at any such sale.

                  (g) Subject to the last sentence of Section 1.3(a), the
      liability of Borrowers under this Section 1.3 is in addition to and shall
      be cumulative with all liabilities of each Borrower to Agents and Lenders
      under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Borrower
      is a party, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or
      agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically
      provides to the contrary.

      1.4 Conversion to Dollars.

                  (a) All valuations or computations of monetary amounts set
      forth in this Agreement shall include the Dollar Equivalent of amounts in
      Canadian Dollars, Sterling and Euros. In connection with all Dollar
      amounts set forth in this Agreement, and the Aggregate Borrowing Base,
      U.S. Borrowing Base, U.K. Borrowing Base and Canadian Borrowing Base
      calculations, all Canadian Dollars, Euros and Sterling shall be converted
      to Dollars in accordance with the following procedure:


                                       10
<PAGE>

                  (i) Conversions to Dollars shall occur in accordance with
            prevailing exchange rates, as determined by Agent in its reasonable
            discretion, on the applicable date; and

                  (ii) Outstanding Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars,
            Sterling and Euros shall be marked to market on the date on which
            Borrower Representative is required to deliver to Agent Borrowing
            Base Certificates as provided in Section 7.1.4 hereof (or more often
            as determined by Agent in its commercially reasonable discretion),
            taking into account in each case the Dollar Equivalent of all
            Revolving Credit Loans outstanding in Canadian Dollars, Sterling and
            Euros.

            (b) Unless otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement,
      monetary amounts shall be in Dollars.

      1.5 Judgment Currency; Contractual Currency.

                  (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment
      against any Borrower in any court in any jurisdiction, it becomes
      necessary to convert into any other currency (such other currency being
      hereinafter in this Section 1.5 referred to as the "Judgment Currency") an
      amount due under any Loan Document in any currency (the "Obligation
      Currency") other than the Judgment Currency, the conversion shall be made
      at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business Day immediately
      preceding (i) the date of actual payment of the amount due, in the case of
      any proceeding in the courts of any jurisdiction that will give effect to
      such conversion being made on such date, or (ii) the date on which the
      judgment is given, in the case of any proceeding in the courts of any
      other jurisdiction (the applicable date as of which such conversion is
      made pursuant to this Section 1.5 being hereinafter in this Section 1.5
      referred to as the "Judgment Conversion Date").

                  (b) If, in the case of any proceeding in the court of any
      jurisdiction referred to in Section 1.5(a), there is a change in the rate
      of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Conversion Date and the date
      of actual receipt for value of the amount due, the applicable Borrower
      shall pay such additional amount (if any, but in any event not a lesser
      amount) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount actually received in
      the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing
      on the date of payment, will produce the amount of the Obligation Currency
      which could have been purchased with the amount of the Judgment Currency
      stipulated in the judgment or judicial order at the rate of exchange
      prevailing on the Judgment Conversion Date. Any amount due from a Borrower
      under this Section 1.5(b) shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be
      affected by judgment being obtained for any other amounts due under or in
      respect of any of the Loan Documents.

                  (c) The term "rate of exchange" in this Section 1.5 means the
      rate of exchange at which Agent would, on the relevant date at or about
      12:00 noon (Chicago time), be prepared to sell the Obligation Currency
      against the Judgment Currency.


                                       11
<PAGE>

                  (d) Any amount received or recovered by Agents in respect of
      any sum expressed to be due to them (whether for itself or as trustee for
      any other person) from any Borrower under this Agreement or under any of
      the other Loan Documents in a currency other than the currency (the
      "contractual currency") in which such sum is so expressed to be due
      (whether as a result of, or from the enforcement of, any judgment or order
      of a court or tribunal of any jurisdiction, the winding-up of a Borrower
      or otherwise) shall only constitute a discharge of such Borrower to the
      extent of the amount of the contractual currency that the relevant Agent
      is able, in accordance with its usual practice, to purchase with the
      amount of the currency so received or recovered on the date of receipt or
      recovery (or, if later, the first date on which such purchase is
      practicable). If the amount of the contractual currency so purchased is
      less than the amount of the contractual currency so expressed to be due,
      such Borrower shall indemnify the relevant Agent against any loss
      sustained by it as a result, including the cost of making any such
      purchase.

      1.6 Term Loan. Each U.S. Lender, severally and not jointly, agrees to make
a term loan (collectively, the "Term Loan") to U.S. Borrower on the Closing
Date, in the principal amount of such Lender's Term Loan Commitment, which shall
be repayable in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan Notes and shall be
secured by all of the Collateral. The aggregate amount of all Term Loan
Commitments and the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan is $20,000,000.
The proceeds of the Term Loan shall be used solely for the purposes for which
the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Loans are authorized to be used.

                     SECTION 2. INTEREST, FEES AND CHARGES

      2.1 Interest.

                  (a) U.S. Rates of Interest. Interest on Revolving Credit Loans
      and the Term Loan to U.S. Borrower shall accrue on the principal amount of
      the Base Rate Revolving Portions and Term Loan Portions outstanding at the
      end of each day at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the Applicable
      Margin then in effect plus the Base Rate. Said rate of interest shall
      increase or decrease by an amount equal to any increase or decrease in the
      Base Rate, effective as of the opening of business on the day that any
      such change in the Base Rate occurs. If Borrower Representative, on behalf
      of U.S. Borrower, exercises its LIBOR Option as provided in Section 3.1,
      interest on the Revolving Credit Loans and the Term Loan to U.S. Borrower
      shall accrue on the principal amount of the LIBOR Revolving Portions and
      LIBOR Term Portions outstanding at the end of each day at a rate per annum
      equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect plus the LIBOR applicable to
      each LIBOR Portion for the corresponding Interest Period.

                  (b) U.K. Rates of Interest. Interest on Revolving Credit Loans
      in Sterling or Euros to U.K. Borrower shall accrue on the principal amount
      of the Base Rate Revolving Portions outstanding at the end of each day at
      a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect
      plus the Base Rate. Said rate of interest shall increase or decrease by an
      amount equal to any increase or decrease in the Base Rate, effective as of
      the opening of business on the day that any such change in the Base


                                       12
<PAGE>

      Rate occurs. If Borrower Representative, on behalf of U.K. Borrower,
      exercises its LIBOR Option as provided in Section 3.1, interest on the
      Revolving Credit Loans in Sterling or Euros to U.K. Borrower shall accrue
      on the principal amount of the LIBOR Revolving Portions outstanding at the
      end of each day at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin then in
      effect plus the LIBOR applicable to each LIBOR Portion for the
      corresponding Interest Period plus Mandatory Costs.

                  (c) Canadian Rates of Interest. Interest on Canadian Revolving
      Credit Loans in Canadian Dollars to Canadian Borrower shall accrue on the
      principal amount of the Base Rate Revolving Portions outstanding at the
      end of each day at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the Applicable
      Margin then in effect plus the Base Rate. Said rate of interest shall
      increase or decrease by an amount equal to any increase or decrease in the
      Base Rate, effective as of the opening of business on the day that any
      such change in the Base Rate occurs. If Borrower Representative, on behalf
      of Canadian Borrower, exercises its option to obtain a Canadian BA Rate
      Loan as provided in Section 3.1, interest on Canadian Revolving Credit
      Loans to Canadian Borrower shall accrue on the principal amount of
      Canadian BA Rate Loans outstanding at the end of each day at a rate per
      annum equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect plus the Canadian BA
      Rate applicable to each Canadian BA Rate Loan for the corresponding
      Interest Period.

                  (d) Unless Borrower Representative is otherwise advised by
      Agent, interest and Letter of Credit and LC Guaranty fees shall be payable
      solely in the currency in which the underlying Revolving Credit Loan is
      made or Letter or Credit or LC Guaranty is issued.

      2.1.2 Default Rate of Interest. At the option of Agent or the Majority
Lenders, upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the
continuation thereof, the principal amount of all Loans shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to 2.0% plus the interest rate otherwise applicable thereto
(the "Default Rate"). Provided that in accordance with Section 8(1) of the
Interest Act (Canada), it is agreed amongst all of the parties to this Agreement
that the Default Rate as stipulated in this Section 2.1.2. shall not apply to
any security interest securing the Canadian Obligations of the Canadian Borrower
where the security interest constitutes a charge, mortgage, encumbrance,
hypothec or notice on or against any real Property situate in Canada.

      2.1.3 Maximum Interest.

                  (a) In no event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all amounts
      deemed interest hereunder or under the Notes and charged or collected
      pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to the Notes exceed
      the highest rate permissible under any law which a court of competent
      jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto (the
      "Maximum Rate"). If any provisions of this Agreement or the Notes are in
      contravention of any such law, such provisions shall be deemed amended to
      conform thereto. If at any time, the amount of interest paid hereunder is
      limited by the Maximum Rate, and the amount at which interest accrues
      hereunder is subsequently below the Maximum Rate, the rate at which
      interest accrues hereunder shall remain at the


                                       13
<PAGE>

      Maximum Rate, until such time as the aggregate interest paid hereunder
      equals the amount of interest that would have been paid had the Maximum
      Rate not applied.

                  (b) Without limiting subsection 2.1.3(a), if any provision of
      this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents would obligate Canadian
      Borrower to make any payment of interest under the Canadian Obligations or
      the U.K. Obligations or other amount in an amount or calculated at a rate
      which would be prohibited by law or would result in a receipt by the
      applicable recipient of interest under the Canadian or U.K. Obligations at
      a criminal rate (as such terms are construed under the Criminal Code
      (Canada)) then, notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rates shall
      be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum
      amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so
      prohibited by law or so result in a receipt by the applicable recipient of
      interest under the Canadian or U.K. Obligations at a criminal rate, such
      adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (1)
      firstly, by reducing the amount or rates of interest required to be paid
      to the applicable recipient under this subsection 2.1.3(b); and (2)
      thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts
      required to be paid to the applicable recipient which would constitute
      interest under the Canadian or U.K. Obligations for purposes of Section
      347 of the Criminal Code (Canada). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
      after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if the
      applicable recipient shall have received an amount in excess of the
      maximum permitted by that section of the Criminal Code (Canada), then the
      applicable recipient shall be entitled, by notice in writing to Canadian
      Agent at the Appropriate Notice Office, to obtain reimbursement from the
      applicable recipient in an amount equal to such excess, and pending such
      reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an amount payable by the
      applicable recipient to Canadian Borrower. Any amount or rate of interest
      under the Canadian Obligations or the U.K. Obligations referred to in this
      subsection 2.1.3 shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted
      actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest
      over the term that any Canadian Revolving Credit Loan to Canadian Borrower
      or U.K. Revolving Credit Loans to U.K. Borrower, as applicable, remains
      outstanding on the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall
      within the meaning of "interest" (as defined in the Criminal Code
      (Canada)) shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be pro rated
      over that period of time and otherwise be pro rated over the period from
      the Closing Date to the date all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid
      in full and all Canadian Lender's Revolving Loan Commitments have been
      terminated and, in the event of a dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of
      the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by Canadian Agent shall be
      conclusive for the purposes of such determination.

                  (c) For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act
      (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of
      interest or fees provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
      for the Canadian Obligations (and stated herein or therein, as applicable,
      to be computed on the basis of a 360-day year or any other period of time
      less than a calendar year) are equivalent to the rates so determined
      multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year
      and divided by 360 or such other period of time, respectively.


                                       14
<PAGE>

      2.2 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest, Letter of Credit and LC
Guaranty fees and Unused Line Fees hereunder shall be calculated daily and shall
be computed on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days (except
for the U.K. Obligations denominated in Sterling, which shall be based on a
365-day year). Unless otherwise set forth herein, all fees and interest shall be
paid in the same currency as the Revolving Credit Loan is made or Letter of
Credit or LC Guaranty is issued for which such fee or interest is associated.

      2.3 Fee Letter. U.S. Borrower shall pay to Agent certain fees and other
amounts in accordance with the terms of the fee letter between Borrower and
Agent (the "Fee Letter").

      2.4 Letter of Credit and LC Guaranty Fees. Each applicable Borrower shall
pay to Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, for standby and
documentary Letters of Credit and LC Guaranties of standby and documentary
letters of credit issued without duplication, for the ratable benefit of the
applicable Lenders, a per annum fee equal to the Applicable Margin then in
effect of the aggregate available amount of such U.S. Letters of Credit and U.S.
LC Guaranties, Canadian Letters of Credit and Canadian LC Guaranties and U.K.
Letters of Credit and U.K. LC Guaranties, issued for the account of that
Borrower and outstanding from time to time during the term of this Agreement,
plus a fronting fee (for the account of Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as
applicable) equal to 0.125% per annum of the aggregate available amount of such
U.S. Letters of Credit, U.S. LC Guaranties, U.K. Letters of Credit, U.K. LC
Guaranties, Canadian Letters of Credit and Canadian LC Guaranties, plus all
normal and customary charges of the Agent, Bank, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent,
as applicable, associated with the issuance and administration thereof, which
fees and charges shall be deemed fully earned upon issuance of each such Letter
of Credit or LC Guaranty or as advised by Agent, Bank or U.K. Agent, as
applicable, and shall be due and payable on the first Business Day of each month
in arrears or as advised by Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, and shall not be
subject to rebate or proration upon the termination of this Agreement for any
reason.

      2.5 Unused Line Fee. U.S. Borrower shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of
each Lender (except the U.K. Lender and the Canadian Lender) in accordance with
its Revolving Loan Percentage, a fee (the "Unused Line Fee") equal to the
Applicable Margin per annum multiplied by the average daily amount by which the
aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Dollar Equivalent
of the outstanding principal balance of the sum of the U.S. Revolving Credit
Loans, U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and Canadian Revolving Credit Loans, plus
(ii) the LC Amount; provided that for purposes of allocating the Unused Line Fee
among Lenders, outstanding Swingline Loans shall not be included as part of the
outstanding balance of the U.S. Revolving Credit Loans for the purposes of
calculating such fees owed to U.S. Lenders other than Agent. The Unused Line Fee
shall be paid in Dollars. The Unused Line Fee shall be payable monthly in
arrears on the first day of each month hereafter.

      2.6 Fronting Fees and Participation Fees. When and as interest is
collected on Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and
until the Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and U.K. Revolving Credit Loans are
refunded in accordance with Sections 3.13 and 3.14, Canadian Agent and U.K.
Agent, respectively, shall pay to Canadian Lender and U.K. Lender, respectively,
a fee (with respect to Canadian Lender, the "Canadian Fronting Fee," with
respect to the U.K. Lender, the "U.K. Fronting Fee" and collectively, the
"Fronting Fee") equal to 1/8th of one percent (0.125%) per annum of the
outstanding principal


                                       15
<PAGE>

balances of the Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and U.K. Revolving Credit Loans,
respectively, at such time, and Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent shall pay to each
Canadian Participant and U.K. Participant, respectively, a participation fee (a
"Participation Fee") equal to the product of such Canadian Participant's or U.K.
Participant's, as applicable, corresponding Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage
and that portion of interest collected equal to the sum of Applicable Margins
then in effect with respect to each of the Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and
the U.K. Revolving Credit Loans, respectively, for the relevant interest payment
period plus any Default Rate then in effect, less the product of such Canadian
Participant's or U.K. Participant's Revolving Loan Percentage and the Fronting
Fee. If any Borrower pays less than all of the interest then due and owing by it
for any period, that portion of the interest equating to the Participation Fee
shall be deemed to be the last portion of interest paid or to be paid.

      2.7 Examination Fees. Borrowers shall pay to Agent, Canadian Agent and/or
U.K. Agent, as applicable, examination fees in accordance with Agent's current
schedule of fees in effect from time to time generally applicable to
examinations and verifications of books and records of borrowers of such party,
in connection with examinations and verifications of the books and records and
Properties of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and such other matters as Agents
shall deem appropriate in their reasonable credit judgment, plus all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Agent in connection with such
examinations and verifications, whether such examinations and verifications are
conducted by employees of an Agent or by third parties hired by such Agent;
provided that U.K. Borrower and Canadian Borrower shall not be responsible for
such fees and expenses incurred with respect to U.S. Loan Parties; and provided,
further, that Borrowers shall not be required to pay or reimburse Agents for
examination and verification fees and related expenses for more than two such
examinations and verifications per annum unless an Event of Default exists and
is continuing. Such examination and verification fees and out-of-pocket expenses
shall be payable on the first day of the month following the date of issuance by
Agent of a request for payment thereof to Borrowers. Agents may, in their
discretion, provide for the payment of such amounts by making appropriate
Revolving Credit Loans to the applicable Borrower and charging such Borrower's
Loan Account therefor.

      2.8 Reimbursement of Expenses. If, at any time or times regardless of
whether or not an Event of Default then exists: (i) Agents incur legal or
accounting expenses or any other out-of-pocket expenses or costs in connection
with (1) the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, any amendment of or modification of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, or (2) the administration of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; or
(ii) Agents or any Lender incurs reasonable legal or accounting expenses or any
other out-of-pocket expenses or costs in connection with (1) any litigation,
contest, dispute, suit, proceeding or action (whether instituted by Agents, any
Lender, any Borrower or any other Person) relating to the Collateral, this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any Borrower's affairs, (2) any
attempt to enforce any rights of Agents or any Lender against Borrowers or any
other Person which may be obligated to Agents or any Lender by virtue of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the
Account Debtors, or (3) any attempt by Agent to inspect, verify, protect,
preserve, restore, collect, sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of or realize
upon the Collateral; then all such legal and accounting expenses and other
out-of-pocket expenses and costs of Agents or any Lender, as applicable, shall
be charged to the


                                       16
<PAGE>

applicable Borrower; provided, that such Borrower shall not be responsible for
such out-of-pocket expenses and costs to the extent incurred because of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agents or any Lender; and provided,
further, that U.K. Borrower and Canadian Borrowers shall not be responsible for
such out-of-pocket costs and expenses, incurred with respect to U.S. Borrowers.
All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under this Section 2.8 shall be Obligations
secured by all of the Collateral (provided that amounts chargeable to U.S.
Borrowers shall not be secured by U.K. Collateral or Canadian Collateral), shall
be payable on demand to Agents or such Lender, as the case may be, and shall
bear interest from the date such demand is made until paid in full at the rate
applicable to Base Rate Revolving Portions (or, in the case of Canadian Agent or
Canadian Lender, Canadian Prime Rate Loans) from time to time. The applicable
Borrower shall also reimburse Agents for expenses incurred by Agents in their
administration of the Collateral to the extent and in the manner provided in
Sections 2.9 and 2.10 hereof.

      2.9 Bank Charges. Each Borrower shall pay to Agents, on demand, any and
all fees, costs or expenses which Agents or any Lender pays to a bank or other
similar institution arising out of or in connection with (i) the forwarding to
such Borrower or any other Person on behalf of such Borrower, by Agents or any
Lender, of proceeds of Loans made to such Borrower pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii) the depositing for collection by Agents or any Lender of any check or item
of payment received or delivered to Agents or any Lender on account of the
Obligations of such Borrower and (iii) the costs and expenses incurred in
opening and maintaining blocked accounts; provided, that U.K. Borrower and
Canadian Borrower shall not be responsible for such fees and expenses incurred
with respect to U.S. Borrowers.

      2.10 Collateral Protection Expenses. All out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in protecting, storing, warehousing, insuring, handling, maintaining and
shipping the Collateral, and any and all excise, property, sales, and use taxes
imposed by any United States, Canadian or United Kingdom state, provincial,
federal, or local authority on any of the Collateral or in respect of the sale
thereof shall be borne and paid by Borrowers; provided, that U.K. Borrower and
Canadian Borrower shall not be liable for any such expenses incurred with
respect to U.S. Borrower. If Borrowers fail to promptly pay any portion thereof
when due, Agents may, at their option, but shall not be required to, pay the
same and charge the applicable Borrower therefor. Additionally, from time to
time Agent, Canadian Agent and/or U.K. Agent may, at U.S. Borrower's, U.K.
Borrower's or Canadian Borrower's expense, as applicable, obtain appraisals from
appraisers (who may be personnel of an Agent), stating the then current fair
market value of all or any portion of the real or personal Property of any
Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Loan Party, including, without
limitation, any Inventory of any Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any other
Loan Party; provided that unless an Event of Default exists and is continuing,
Borrowers shall not be required to reimburse Agents for the costs of more than
one appraisal of Equipment, real Property and/or Inventory per annum.

      2.11 Payment of Charges. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under this
Agreement shall be Obligations secured by all of the Collateral (provided that
amounts chargeable to U.S. Borrower shall not be payable by U.K. Borrower or
Canadian Borrower and shall not be secured by U.K. Collateral or Canadian
Collateral). All such Obligations shall be, unless specifically otherwise
provided, payable on demand and shall bear interest from the date demand was
made or such amount is due, as applicable, until paid in full at the rate
applicable to Base Rate


                                       17
<PAGE>

Revolving Portions (or, in the case of Canadian Obligations, Canadian Prime Rate
Loans) from time to time.

      2.12 No Deductions. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.12(b) or
(c) and in subsection 10.9.4 and as otherwise provided by law, any and all
payments or reimbursements made hereunder or under the other Loan Documents in
respect of Canadian Obligations, U.K. Obligations or U.S. Obligations shall be
made in Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars or Sterling, as applicable, free and
clear of and without deduction for any and all taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
imposed by (i) the United States of America or any political subdivision thereof
or therein, in the case of U.S. Obligations, (ii) Canada or any political
subdivision thereof or therein, in the case of the Canadian Obligations, or
(iii) the United Kingdom or any political subdivision thereof or therein, in the
case of the U.K. Obligations, excluding, however, the following: (i) franchise
or capital taxes, gross receipt taxes and taxes imposed on the net income of
Agents, or any Lender, Participant or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant
by the jurisdiction under the laws of which Agents or any Lender, Participant or
Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant is organized or doing business or any
political subdivision thereof, (ii) franchise or capital taxes, gross receipt
taxes and taxes imposed on its net income by the jurisdiction of Agents' or such
Lender's or Participant's or Canadian Participant's or U.K. Participant's
applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof and (iii) any and
all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, imposed by a jurisdiction as a result of the
Agent, any Lender, any Participant, any Canadian Participant, or any United
Kingdom Participant being organized under the laws of such jurisdiction, being
engaged in a trade or business in such jurisdiction, or having a permanent
establishment in such jurisdiction (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings and all liabilities with respect
thereto, herein "Tax Liabilities"). If any Borrower, any Guarantor, any Lender
or any Agent shall be required by law or the administration thereof to deduct
any such Tax Liabilities from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any
Agent or any Lender or Participant or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant,
then the sum payable by the relevant Borrower hereunder or under the relevant
other Loan Document shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after all
required deductions on account of Tax Liabilities are made, the applicable
Agent, any such Lender, Participant, Canadian Participant and U.K. Participant,
as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions been made. Whenever any Tax Liabilities are deducted by any
Borrower, as soon as practicable thereafter, the Borrower Representative shall
send to Agent (or in the case of Canadian Borrower, Canadian Agent, or in the
case of U.K. Borrower, U.K. Agent) for its own account or for the account of the
applicable Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant a certified copy
of any original official receipt received by any such Borrower showing payment
thereof or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent
(or Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case may be). If any Borrower fails to
pay any Tax Liabilities when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to
remit to Agent (or in the case of Canadian Borrower, Canadian Agent, or in the
case of U.K. Borrower, U.K. Agent) the required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, each Borrower shall indemnify Agents and the Lenders and
Canadian Participants and U.K. Participants for any incremental taxes, interest
or penalties that may become payable by Agents and the Lenders and Canadian
Participants and U.K. Participants as a result of any such failure. Without
limiting the foregoing, (x) U.K. Borrower shall also indemnify and hold harmless
(without duplication) U.K. Agent, U.K. Lender and U.K. Participants against any
and


                                       18
<PAGE>

all Tax Liabilities imposed by the United Kingdom as a result of arrangements
relating to the refunding pursuant to Section 3.14 of this Agreement of U.K.
Revolving Credit Loans and (y) Canadian Borrower shall also indemnify and hold
harmless (without duplication) Canadian Agent, Canadian Lender and Canadian
Participants against any and all Tax Liabilities imposed by Canada as a result
of arrangements relating to the refunding pursuant to Section 3.13 of this
Agreement of Canadian Revolving Credit Loans. The covenants in this Section 2.12
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and payment of the Obligations.

                  (a) If Agents or a Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K.
      Participant during the Term of this Agreement shall become aware that it
      is entitled to claim a refund, credit or reduction of tax from the
      jurisdiction to which the tax was paid or the jurisdiction in which such
      Agent or Lender, as the case may be, is subject to tax, which refund,
      credit or reduction in the bona fide discretion of Agents or such Lender
      or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant, is allocable to the payment
      of any Tax Liabilities which Borrowers have paid, or indemnified Agents or
      such Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant pursuant to this
      Section 2.12, Agents or such Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K.
      Participant shall promptly notify Borrowers in writing of the availability
      of such refund, credit or reduction claim and shall, within 30 days of
      receipt of a written request by Borrowers, make a claim to such
      jurisdiction for such refund, credit or reduction at Borrowers' sole
      expense. If, during the Term of this Agreement, Agents or a Lender or
      Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant receives a refund, credit or
      reduction of any such Tax Liabilities, it shall within 30 days from the
      date of such receipt pay over such amount of such refund, credit or
      reduction to Borrowers plus any interest that is properly attributable to
      such refund, credit or reduction as will leave Agents or such Lender or
      Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant (after that payment) in the same
      after-tax position as it would have been in if the Tax Liabilities had not
      been paid by, or indemnification had not been made by, Borrowers.

                  (b) To the extent that any portion of the Participation Fee is
      payable to a Canadian Participant that is non-resident of Canada for
      purposes of the tax imposed pursuant to Part XIII of the ITA or any
      successor provision thereto (a "Nonresident Canadian Participant"),
      Canadian Agent shall deduct and remit such tax to the Receiver General for
      Canada within the time payable by law, and shall increase such portion of
      the Participation Fee as may be necessary so that after all required
      deductions of such tax are made, the Nonresident Canadian Participant
      receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
      deductions been made. The Canadian Borrower shall forthwith on demand
      remit to Canadian Agent the full amount of the aforesaid increase;
      provided, however, that no Borrower will make such payment with respect to
      any taxes that are not Tax Liabilities and no such payment shall be
      required as contemplated by Section 2.12(d). Each of Canadian Agent,
      Canadian Lender and each Canadian Participant represents and warrants to
      Canadian Borrower and to Canadian Agent that, as of the date of this
      Agreement or, in the case of a Canadian Participant which is not a party
      to this Agreement on the date hereof, on the date it becomes a Canadian
      Participant, it is not a non-resident of Canada within the meaning of the
      ITA. Provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
      continuing, Canadian Lender covenants and agrees with Canadian Borrower
      that (i) it is the only Person that will extend credit to Canadian
      Borrower hereunder and (ii) it will not assign, sell or grant
      participations in its


                                       19
<PAGE>

      extensions of credit under this Agreement to any Person who is a
      non-resident of Canada within the meaning of the ITA. Canadian Borrower
      shall not be required to pay any Tax Liabilities of any Person incurred as
      a result of such Person being a non-resident of Canada who becomes a
      Lender or Canadian Participant in contravention of the previous sentence.
      In the event that any of Canadian Agent, Canadian Lender or any Canadian
      Participant is or becomes a non-resident of Canada within the meaning of
      the ITA, such party shall immediately notify Canadian Borrower and
      notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Canadian Borrower shall
      have the option to prepay that portion of the Canadian Obligations
      attributable to such party without the payment of any prepayment penalty,
      fee or other amounts.

                  (c) Limitations on U.K. Tax gross up.

                  (i) Definitions.

                        In this Section 2.12(c):

                        "Qualifying U.K. Lender" means a U.K. Lender which is
            beneficially entitled to interest payable to that U.K. Lender in
            respect of an advance that it made under a Loan Document and which
            is:

                        (1) a bank (as defined for the purpose of section 349 of
            the United Kingdom Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) making an
            advance under a Loan Document and which U.K. Lender is within the
            charge to United Kingdom corporation tax as respects any payments of
            interest made in respect of that advance; or

                        (2) a Treaty Lender.

                        "Treaty Lender" means a U.K. Lender (including any
            assignee from such a U.K. Lender) which:

                        (1) is treated for the purposes of an applicable double
            taxation agreement or convention as resident in a jurisdiction
            having a double taxation agreement or convention with the United
            Kingdom which makes provision for full exemption from tax imposed by
            the United Kingdom on interest; and

                        (2) does not carry on a business in the United Kingdom
            through a permanent establishment with which that U.K. Lender's
            participation in a U.K. Loan Document is effectively connected.

                  (ii) Tax gross up exclusion.

                              a. U.K. Borrower is not required to pay any
                  additional amount to a U.K. Lender or U.K. Participant under
                  this clause 2.12 on account of any Tax Liability imposed by
                  the United Kingdom if, on the date on which the payment is
                  made:


                                    20
<PAGE>

                                    i. the payment could have been made to the
                        relevant U.K. Lender or U.K. Participant without a
                        deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax
                        Liability imposed by the United Kingdom if the U.K.
                        Lender or U.K. Participant was a Qualifying U.K. Lender,
                        but on that date that U.K. Lender or U.K. Participant is
                        not or has ceased to be a Qualifying U.K. Lender other
                        than as a result of any change after the date it became
                        a U.K. Lender or U.K. Participant under this Agreement
                        in (or in the interpretation, administration, or
                        application of) any law or treaty, or any published
                        practice or concession of any relevant taxing authority;
                        or

                                    ii. the relevant U.K. Lender or U.K.
                        Participant is a Treaty Lender and U.K. Borrower can
                        demonstrate the payment could have been made to the U.K.
                        Lender or U.K. Participant without the deduction or
                        withholding for or on account of any Tax Liability had
                        that U.K. Lender or U.K. Participant complied with its
                        obligations under paragraph b. below.

                              b. A Treaty Lender and U.K. Borrower shall
                  cooperate in completing any procedural formalities on a timely
                  basis necessary for U.K. Borrower to obtain authorization to
                  make payments to that Treaty Lender without withholding or
                  deduction for or on account of any Tax Liability imposed by
                  the United Kingdom.

                  (iii) Tax Credit.

                  If U.K. Borrower makes an additional payment under this
      Section 2.12 and the relevant U.K. Lender or U.K. Participant determines
      (in its absolute discretion but acting in good faith) that:

                        (1) a credit against, relief or remission for, or
            repayment of any tax is attributable either to an increased payment
            of which that additional payment forms part, or to that additional
            payment; and

                        (2) that U.K. Lender has obtained, utilized and retained
            that credit, relief, remission or repayment,

                        the U.K. Lender or U.K. Participant shall pay an amount
            to U.K. Borrower which that U.K. Lender or U.K. Participant
            determines (in its absolute discretion but acting in good faith)
            will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as
            it would have been in had the additional payment not been required
            under this Section 2.12.

                  (iv) U.K. Lender and U.K. Participant Cooperation. Each U.K.
            Lender and U.K. Participant and U.K. Borrower shall cooperate (and
            U.K. Agent shall cooperate with the relevant parties) in completing
            any procedural formalities on a timely basis necessary for U.K.
            Borrower to obtain authorization to make


                                       21
<PAGE>

            payments to that U.K. Lender or U.K. Participant without withholding
            or deduction for or on account of any Tax Liability or at any
            applicable reduced rate of withholding or deduction under the terms
            of any applicable double taxation agreement or convention.

                  (v) U.K. Lenders' Warranty. Provided that no Default or Event
            of Default has occurred and is continuing, each U.K. Lender
            covenants and agrees with U.K. Borrower that it will not assign,
            sell or grant participations in its extensions of credit under this
            Agreement to any Person who is not a Qualifying U.K. Lender. U.K.
            Borrower shall not be required to pay any Tax Liabilities of any
            Person incurred as a result of such Person not being a Qualifying
            U.K. Lender on contravention of the previous sentence. U.K. Lender
            further warrants that it is a Qualifying U.K. Lender at the date of
            this Agreement (or, if later, when it becomes a party to this
            Agreement) and that it will remain, until it notifies U.K. Lender to
            the contrary, a Qualifying U.K. Lender. U.K. Lender undertakes to
            notify U.K. Borrower as soon as reasonably practical after it
            becomes aware that it is not or will cease to be a Qualify U.K.
            Lender.

                  (d) The foregoing notwithstanding, Borrowers shall only be
      required to pay additional amounts for Tax Liabilities resulting from any
      Canadian Participant being a non-resident of Canada within the meaning of
      the ITA or any U.K. Participant not being a Qualifying U.K. Lender or a
      Treaty Lender for interest accruing after the date on which the
      Obligations are declared immediately due and payable pursuant to Section
      9.2 of the Agreement.

      2.13 Allocation of Fees and Expenses. Unless expressly allocated to a
specific Borrower, all fees and expenses paid pursuant to this Agreement shall
be allocated to the Borrower which pays such fees and expenses.

                         SECTION 3. LOAN ADMINISTRATION

      3.1 Manner of Borrowing Revolving Credit Loans/LIBOR Option. Borrowings
under the credit facility established pursuant to Section 1 hereof shall be as
follows:

            3.1.1 Loan Requests. A request for a Revolving Credit Loan shall be
made, or shall be deemed to be made, in the following manner: (a) Borrower
Representative, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, or, in the case of any
request to the Canadian Agent or the U.K. Agent, the Canadian Borrower or the
U.K. Borrower, as applicable, may give Agent, or Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent,
as applicable, with a copy to Agent at the Appropriate Notice Office notice in a
form reasonably acceptable to Agent of such Borrower's intention to borrow, in
which notice Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower (if applicable and as the
case may be) shall specify the amount of the proposed borrowing of a Revolving
Credit Loan, the currency in which the borrowing is requested (which shall be
Dollars in the case of a U.S. Revolving Credit Loan to U.S. Borrower, Canadian
Dollars in the case of a Canadian Revolving Credit Loan to Canadian Borrower and
Sterling or Euros in the case of a U.K. Revolving Credit Loan to U.K. Borrower)
and the proposed borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day, no later than
11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice Office) on
the proposed borrowing


                                       22
<PAGE>

date (or in accordance with subsection 3.1.7, 3.1.8 or 3.1.9, as applicable, in
the case of a request for a LIBOR Revolving Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan),
provided, however, that no request for a LIBOR Loan or Canadian BA Rate Loan may
be made at a time when there exists a Default or an Event of Default; and (b)
the becoming due of any amount required to be paid under this Agreement, or the
Notes, whether as interest or for any other Obligation, shall be deemed
irrevocably to be a request for a Revolving Credit Loan by the applicable
Borrower on the due date in the amount required to pay such interest or other
Obligation. With respect to borrowings under the overdraft forming part of the
U.K. Revolving Credit Loans, the prior notice requirements and minimum borrowing
amounts may be waived by U.K. Agent.

            3.1.2 Disbursement. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes
Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, to disburse the proceeds of
each Loan requested, or deemed to be requested, pursuant to subsection 3.1.1 as
follows: (i) the proceeds of each Revolving Credit Loan requested under
subsection 3.1.1(a) shall be disbursed by Agent in Dollars, as requested by
Borrower Representative (in the case of U.S. Borrower), by Canadian Agent in
Canadian Dollars, as requested by Borrower Representative or Canadian Borrower
(in the case of Canadian Borrower) and by U.K. Agent in Sterling or Euros, as
requested by Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower (in the case of U.K.
Borrower), as applicable, in immediately available funds, in the case of the
initial borrowing, in accordance with the terms of the written disbursement
letter from Borrower Representative, and in the case of each subsequent
borrowing, by wire transfer to such bank account as may be agreed upon by
Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower (as the case may be) and Agent,
Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, from time to time or elsewhere if
pursuant to a written direction from Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower,
as the case may be; and (ii) the proceeds of each Revolving Credit Loan deemed
requested under subsection 3.1.1(b) shall be disbursed by Agent, Canadian Agent
or U.K. Agent, as applicable, by way of direct payment of the relevant interest
or other Obligation. If at any time any Loan is funded in excess of the amount
requested or deemed requested by Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower (as
the case may be), such Borrower agrees to repay the excess to Agent, Canadian
Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, immediately upon the earlier to occur of (a)
such Borrower's discovery of the error and (b) notice thereof to Borrower
Representative or U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, from Agent, Canadian Agent
or U.K. Agent, as applicable, or any Lender.

            3.1.3 Payment by Lenders. Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as
applicable, shall give to each applicable Lender prompt written notice by
facsimile, telex or cable of the receipt from Borrower Representative or U.K.
Borrower of any request for a Revolving Credit Loan. Each such notice shall
specify the requested date and amount of such Revolving Credit Loan, whether
such Revolving Credit Loan shall be subject to the LIBOR Option or shall be a
Canadian BA Rate Loan, the currency of such Revolving Credit Loan, and the
amount of each such Lender's advance thereunder (in accordance with its
applicable Revolving Loan Percentage). Each such Lender shall, not later than
12:00 noon (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice Office) on
such requested date, wire to a bank designated by Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K.
Agent, as applicable, the amount of that Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage of
the requested Revolving Credit Loan. The failure of any Lender to make the
Revolving Credit Loans to be made by it shall not release any other Lender of
its obligations hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Loan. Neither Agent,
Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for the failure
of any other Lender to make the Revolving


                                       23
<PAGE>

Credit Loan to be made by such other Lender. The foregoing notwithstanding,
Agent, and following a refunding of the Canadian Revolving Credit Loan and U.K.
Revolving Credit Loan in accordance with Sections 3.13 and 3.14, Canadian Agent
or U.K. Agent, as applicable, in its sole discretion, may from its own funds
make a Revolving Credit Loan on behalf of the applicable Lenders. In such event,
the Lender on behalf of whom Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent made the
Revolving Credit Loan shall reimburse Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as
applicable, for the amount of such Revolving Credit Loan made on its behalf,
weekly (or more frequently, as determined by Agents, in their sole discretion).
On each such settlement date, Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as
applicable, will pay to each Lender the net amount owing to such Lender in
connection with such settlement, including without limitation amounts relating
to Loans, fees, interest and other amounts payable hereunder. The entire amount
of interest attributable to such Revolving Credit Loan for the period from the
date on which such Revolving Credit Loan was made on such Lender's behalf until
so reimbursed by such Lender, shall be paid to Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K.
Agent, as applicable, for its own account.

            3.1.4 Authorization. U.S. Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes
Agent, in Agent's sole discretion, to advance to U.S. Borrower, and to charge to
U.S. Borrower's Loan Account hereunder as a U.S. Revolving Credit Loan in
Dollars (which shall be a Base Rate Revolving Portion), a sum sufficient to pay
all interest accrued on the U.S. Obligations when due and to pay all fees, costs
and expenses and other U.S. Obligations at any time owed by such Borrower to
Agent or Lenders hereunder. U.K. Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes U.K.
Agent, in U.K. Agent's discretion, to advance to U.K. Borrower, and to charge to
such U.K. Borrower's Loan Account hereunder as a U.K. Revolving Credit Loan in
Sterling or Euros, if chosen by U.K. Agent in its discretion, (which shall be a
Base Rate Revolving Portion), a sum sufficient to pay all interest accrued on
the U.K. Obligations when due and to pay all fees, costs and expenses and other
U.K. Obligations at any time owed by U.K. Borrower to U.K. Agent or Lenders
hereunder. Canadian Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Canadian Agent, in
Canadian Agent's sole discretion, to advance to Canadian Borrower, and to charge
to Canadian Borrower's Loan Account hereunder as a Canadian Revolving Credit
Loan in Canadian Dollars (which shall be a Base Rate Loan), a sum sufficient to
pay all interest accrued on the Canadian Obligations when due and to pay all
fees, costs and expenses and other Canadian Obligations at any time owed by
Canadian Borrower to Canadian Agent or Canadian Lender hereunder. Agents shall
notify Borrower Representative of all such advances and charges to a Borrower's
Loan Account on a monthly basis as provided in Section 3.7 of the Agreement.

            3.1.5 Letter of Credit and LC Guaranty Requests. A request for a
Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty shall be made in the following manner: Borrower
Representative or, in the case of notice to Fleet U.K., U.K. Borrower, may give
Agent and Bank and Fleet U.K. or Fleet Canada, as applicable, a written notice
of its request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty, not later
than 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice
Office), three Business Days before the proposed issuance date thereof, in which
notice Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower shall specify whether the Letter
of Credit or LC Guaranty is to be issued on behalf of a U.S. Loan Party, a
Canadian Loan Party or a U.K. Loan Party, the issuance date and format and
wording for the Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty being requested (which shall be
satisfactory to Agent and Bank or U.K. Agent, as applicable, and the Person
being asked to issue such Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty); and shall include
the Letter of


                                       24
<PAGE>

Credit application of the proposed issuer of the Letter of Credit, duly
completed, provided that no such request may be made at a time when there exists
a Default or Event of Default. Such request shall be accompanied by an executed
application and reimbursement agreement in form and substance satisfactory to
Agents and the Person being asked to issue the Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty
(which shall be Bank or an Affiliate thereof or such other Person as approved by
Agent in its sole discretion), as well as any required resolutions.

            3.1.6 Method of Making Requests. As an accommodation to Borrowers,
unless a Default or an Event of Default is then in existence, (i) solely in the
case of U.S. Revolving Credit Loans to U.S. Borrower, Agent shall permit
telephonic or electronic requests for U.S. Revolving Credit Loans to Agent, (ii)
solely in the case of U.S. Letters of Credit and U.S. LC Guaranties, Agent and
Bank may, in their discretion, permit electronic transmittal of requests for
U.S. Letters of Credit and U.S. LC Guaranties to them, and (iii) Agent may, in
Agent's discretion, permit electronic transmittal of instructions,
authorizations, agreements or reports to Agent. All other instructions,
authorizations, agreements or reports must be in written hard copy form
(including by facsimile). Unless Borrower Representative specifically directs
Agent or Bank in writing not to accept or act upon telephonic or electronic
communications from Borrower Representative, neither Agent nor Bank shall have
any liability to the applicable Borrower for any loss or damage suffered by such
Borrower as a result of Agent's or Bank's honoring of any requests, execution of
any instructions, authorizations or agreements or reliance on any reports
communicated to it telephonically or electronically and purporting to have been
sent to Agent or Bank by Borrower, and neither Agent nor Bank shall have any
duty to verify the origin of any such communication or the authority of the
Person sending it. Each telephonic request for a Revolving Credit Loan, Letter
of Credit or LC Guaranty accepted by Agent and Bank, if applicable, hereunder
shall be promptly followed by a written confirmation of such request from
Borrower Representative to Agent and Bank, if applicable.

            3.1.7 LIBOR Portions and Canadian BA Rate Loans.

                  (a) Provided that as of both the date of the LIBOR Request and
      the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of Default

      third Business Day prior to the requested borrowing date. Each LIBOR
      Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the applicable Borrower. In no
      event shall Borrowers, in the aggregate, be permitted to have outstanding
      at any one time LIBOR Portions with more than seven (7) different Interest
      Periods with respect to U.S. Revolving Credit Loans, U.K. Revolving Credit
      Loans and Canadian BA Rate Loans. The LIBOR Rate shall be available only

      and on behalf of the applicable Borrower, convert any Base Rate Portion
      (except with respect to Revolving Credit Loans to Canadian Borrower) into
      a LIBOR Portion. If the applicable Borrower desires to convert a Base Rate
      Portion, Borrower Representative shall give Agent a LIBOR Request no later
      than 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice

      convert a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, Borrower Representative shall give
      Canadian Agent a Canadian BA Request no later then 11:00 a.m. (prevailing
      time in the location of the Appropriate Notice Office) on the third
      Business Day prior to the requested conversion date.

            3.1.9 Continuation of LIBOR Portions and Canadian BA Rate Loans.

                  (a) Provided that as of both the date of the LIBOR Request and
      the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of Default
      exists, Borrower Representative or U.K. Borrower may, on any Business Day
      and on behalf of the applicable Borrower, continue any LIBOR Portions into
      a subsequent Interest Period of the same or a different permitted
      duration. If any Borrower desires to continue a LIBOR Portion, Borrower
      Representative shall give Agent and U.K. Agent, as applicable, a LIBOR
      Request no later than 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the
      Appropriate Notice Office) on the third Business Day prior to the
      requested continuation date. If Borrower Representative shall fail to give
      timely notice of its election to continue any LIBOR Portion or portion
      thereof as provided above, or if such continuation shall not be permitted,
      such LIBOR Portion or portion thereof, unless such LIBOR Portion shall be
      repaid, shall automatically be converted into a Base Rate Portion at the
      end of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to such LIBOR
      Portion.

                  (b) Provided that as of both the date of the Canadian BA
      Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of
      Default exists, Borrower Representative may, on any Business Day and on
      behalf of Canadian Borrower, continue any Canadian BA Rate Loan into
      another Canadian BA Rate Loan with an Interest Period


                                       26
<PAGE>

      of the same or a different permitted duration. If Canadian Borrower
      desires to continue a Canadian BA Rate Loan, Borrower Representative or
      Canadian Borrower shall give Canadian Agent a Canadian BA Request no later
      than 11:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice
      Office) on the third Business Day prior to the requested continuation
      date. If Borrower Representative shall fail to give timely notice of its
      election to continue any Canadian BA Rate Loan or portion thereof as
      provided above, or if such continuation shall not be permitted, such
      Canadian BA Rate Loan or portion thereof, unless such Canadian BA Rate
      Loan shall be repaid, shall automatically be converted into a Canadian
      Prime Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period then in effect with
      respect to such Canadian BA Rate Loan.

            3.1.10 Inability to Make LIBOR Portions and Canadian BA Rate Loans.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any applicable law, treaty,
regulation or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any Lender (for purposes of this
subsection 3.1.10, the term "Lender" shall include the office or branch where
such Lender or any corporation or bank then controlling such Lender makes or
maintains any LIBOR Portions) to make or maintain its LIBOR Portions or Canadian
BA Rate Loans, or if with respect to any Interest Period, Agent, U.K. Agent or
Canadian Agent is unable to determine the LIBOR or Canadian BA Rate relating
thereto, or adverse or unusual conditions in, or changes in applicable law
relating to, the London interbank market or the Canadian BA market, as
applicable, make it, in the reasonable judgment of Agent, U.K. Agent or Canadian
Agent, impracticable to fund therein any of the LIBOR Portions or Canadian BA
Rate Loans, or make the projected LIBOR or Canadian BA Rate unreflective of the
actual costs of funds therefor to any Lender, the obligation of Agent, U.K.
Agent, Canadian Agent and Lenders to make or continue LIBOR Portions or Canadian
BA Rate Loans or convert Base Rate Portions or Canadian Prime Rate Loans to
LIBOR Portions or Canadian BA Rate Loans, as applicable, hereunder shall
forthwith be suspended during the pendency of such circumstances and the
applicable Borrower shall, if any affected LIBOR Portions or Canadian BA Rate
Loans are then outstanding, promptly upon request from Agent or U.K. Agent,
convert such affected LIBOR Portions into Base Rate Portions, or promptly upon
request from Canadian Agent, convert such affected Canadian BA Rate Loans into
Canadian Prime Rate Loans.

      3.2 Payments. Except where evidenced by notes or other instruments issued
or made by Borrowers to any Lender and accepted by such Lender specifically
containing payment instructions that are in conflict with this Section 3.2 (in
which case the conflicting provisions of said notes or other instruments shall
govern and control), the Obligations shall be payable as follows:

            3.2.1 Principal.

                  (i) Revolving Credit Loans. Principal on account of Revolving
            Credit Loans shall be payable by the applicable Borrower to the
            applicable Agent for the ratable benefit of the applicable Lenders
            at the Appropriate Payment Office immediately upon the earliest of
            (i) the receipt by the applicable Agent, U.K. Borrower, U.S.
            Borrower or Canadian Borrower, of any proceeds of any of the
            Collateral (except as otherwise provided herein), including without
            limitation pursuant to subsections 3.3.1 and 5.2.4, to the extent of
            said proceeds, subject to


                                       27
<PAGE>

            such Borrower's rights to reborrow such amounts in compliance with
            subsection 1.1.1 hereof; (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default
            in consequence of which Agent or Majority Lenders elect to
            accelerate the maturity and payment of the Obligations in accordance
            with Sections 9.2 and/or 9.3 of this Agreement, or (iii) termination
            of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4 hereof; provided, however,
            that, if an Overadvance or an Agent Loan shall exist at any time,
            the applicable Borrower shall, on demand, repay the Overadvance or
            Agent Loan. Each payment (including principal prepayment) by
            Borrowers on account of principal of the Revolving Credit Loans
            shall be applied first to Base Rate Revolving Portions and
            thereafter, subject to subsection 3.3.3 of the Agreement, to LIBOR
            Revolving Portions and Canadian BA Rate Loans, as applicable.

                  (ii) Term Loan. The aggregate principal amount of the Term
            Loan shall be payable in quarterly installments, together with
            accrued and unpaid interest thereon, commencing on April 1, 2003 and
            continuing on each July 1, October 1, January 1 and April 1
            thereafter to and including January 1, 2008 in installments of Seven
            Hundred Fourteen Thousand Two Hundred Eighty-Five and 75/100 Dollars
            ($714,285.75) each. The entire remaining principal amount of the
            Term Loan shall be due and payable on January 30, 2008.

            3.2.2 Interest.

                  (i) Base Rate Portion. Interest accrued on Base Rate Portions
            shall be due and payable by the applicable Borrower to the
            applicable Agent for the ratable benefit of the applicable Lenders
            on the earliest of (1) the first calendar day of each month (for the
            immediately preceding month), computed through the last calendar day
            of the preceding month, (2) the occurrence of an Event of Default in
            consequence of which Agent or Majority Lenders elect to accelerate
            the maturity and payment of the Obligations in accordance with
            Sections 9.2 and/or 9.3 of this Agreement or (3) termination of this
            Agreement pursuant to Section 4 hereof.

                  (ii) LIBOR Portion and Canadian BA Rate. Interest accrued on
            each LIBOR Portion and on Canadian BA Rate Loans shall be due and
            payable by the applicable Borrower to the applicable Agent for the
            ratable benefit of the applicable Lenders on each LIBOR Interest
            Payment Date and on the earlier of (1) the occurrence of an Event of
            Default in consequence of which Agent or Majority Lenders elect to
            accelerate the maturity and payment of the Obligations in accordance
            with Sections 9.2 and/or 9.3 of this Agreement or (2) termination of
            this Agreement pursuant to Section 4 hereof.

            3.2.3 Costs, Fees and Charges. Costs, fees and charges payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be payable by Borrowers to Agent, Canadian
Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, at the Appropriate Payment Office, as and
when provided in Section 2 or Section 3 hereof, as applicable, to Agent,
Canadian Agent, U.K. Agent or a Lender, as applicable, or to any other Person
designated by Agent, Canadian Agent, U.K. Agent or such Lender in writing.


                                       28
<PAGE>

            3.2.4 Other Obligations. The balance of the Obligations requiring
the payment of money, if any, shall be payable by Borrowers to Agents for
distribution to Lenders, as appropriate, as and when provided in this Agreement,
the Other Agreements or the Security Documents, or on demand, whichever is
later, in each case at the Appropriate Payment Office.

            3.2.5 Prepayment of/Failure to Borrow LIBOR Portions. Borrowers may
prepay a LIBOR Portion and Canadian BA Rate Loans at the Appropriate Payment
Office only upon at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice to Agent,
U.K. Agent or Canadian Agent, as applicable (which notice shall be irrevocable).
Each applicable Borrower shall pay to each applicable Lender, upon request of
such Lender, at the Appropriate Payment Office such amount or amounts as shall
be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate such
Lender for any loss, cost, or expense (other than any taxes that are not Tax
Liabilities) incurred as a result of: (i) any payment of a LIBOR Portion or
Canadian BA Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period
for such LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan; (ii) any failure by the
applicable Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan on the
date specified by the Borrower Representative's LIBOR Request or Canadian BA
Request; or (iii) any failure by the applicable Borrower to pay a LIBOR Portion
or Canadian BA Rate Loan on the date for payment specified in Borrower
Representative's written notice. In addition to reimbursement of out-of-pocket
costs and expenses, such compensation shall include a "yield maintenance fee" in
an amount computed as follows: the current rate for (i) United States Treasury
securities (bills on a discounted basis shall be converted to a bond equivalent)
(or Canadian or U.K. equivalent as applicable and as determined by Agent) with
respect to a LIBOR Portion or a Canadian BA Rate Loan being repaid by U.S.
Borrowers, U.K. Borrower or Canadian Borrowers, as the case may be, in each case
with a maturity date closest to the Interest Period chosen pursuant to the LIBOR
Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan as to which the prepayment is made, shall be
subtracted from the LIBOR or Canadian BA Rate in effect at the time of
prepayment. If the result is zero or a negative number, there shall be no yield
maintenance fee. If the result is a positive number, then the resulting
percentage shall be multiplied by the amount of the principal balance being
prepaid. The resulting amount shall be divided by 360 and multiplied by the
number of days remaining in the Interest Period chosen pursuant to the LIBOR
Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan as to which the prepayment is made. Said amount
shall be reduced to present value calculated by using the above referenced
United States Treasury securities (or Canadian equivalent or securities issued
by, or unconditionally guaranteed by, the United Kingdom Government, as
applicable) and the number of days remaining in the term chosen pursuant to the
LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan as to which prepayment is made. The
resulting amount shall be the yield maintenance fee due to the applicable Lender
upon the prepayment of a LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan. If by reason of
an Event of Default, Agent or Majority Lenders elect to declare the Obligations
to be immediately due and payable, then any yield maintenance fee with respect
to a LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loan shall become due and payable in the
same manner as though Borrowers had exercised such right of prepayment.

      3.3 Mandatory and Optional Prepayments.

            3.3.1 Proceeds of Sale, Loss, Destruction or Condemnation of
Collateral. (a) Except as provided in subsections 5.4.2, 7.2.9 and 3.3.1 (b)
below, if any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries sells any of the Collateral or
if any of the Collateral is lost or destroyed or taken


                                       29
<PAGE>

by condemnation, the applicable Borrower shall, unless otherwise agreed by
Majority Lenders, pay to the applicable Agent for the ratable benefit of the
applicable Lenders as and when received by the applicable Borrower or such
Subsidiary and as a mandatory prepayment of the Loans, as herein provided, a sum
equal to the proceeds (including insurance payments but net of costs and taxes
incurred in connection with such sale or event and amounts required to remove
Permitted Liens that are prior to the Liens of Agents) received by the
applicable Borrower or such Subsidiary from such sale, loss, destruction or
condemnation. To the extent that the Collateral sold, lost, destroyed or
condemned consists of Equipment, real Property, or other Property of a U.S. Loan
Party other than Accounts or Inventory, the applicable prepayment shall be
applied first to the installments of principal due under the Term Notes ratably,
to be applied to future installment payments in inverse order of maturity until
paid in full, and second to repay outstanding principal of U.S., Canadian or
U.K. Revolving Credit Loans, as applicable, on a ratable basis. To the extent
that the Collateral sold, lost, destroyed or condemned consists of Accounts or
Inventory or any other asset of a Canadian or U.K. Loan Party, the applicable
prepayment shall be applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the
U.S., Canadian or U.K. Revolving Credit Loans, as applicable, but shall not
permanently reduce the U.S., Canadian or U.K. Revolving Loan Commitments, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the proceeds of insurance (net of
costs and taxes incurred) with respect to any loss or destruction of Equipment,
Inventory or real Property (i) are less than $750,000, unless an Event of
Default is then in existence, Agent shall remit such proceeds to the applicable
Borrower for use in replacing or repairing the damaged Collateral or (ii) are
equal to or greater than $750,000 and the applicable Borrower has requested that
Agent agree to permit such Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary to repair or
replace the damaged Collateral, such amounts shall be provisionally applied to
reduce the outstanding principal balance of the U.S., Canadian or U.K. Revolving
Credit Loans, as applicable. Such amount shall, unless an Event of Default is in
existence, be remitted to the applicable Borrower for use in replacing or
repairing the damaged Collateral; provided that such repairs or replacements are
commenced within 90 days of the date of receipt of such insurance proceeds and
diligently completed thereafter. If such repairs or replacements are not
commenced within any such 90-day period, then such amount shall be applied to
the Loans in the manner specified in the second or third sentence, as
applicable, of this subsection 3.3.1 until payment thereof in full. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no case will the proceeds from any sale, loss,
destruction or condemnation of the Accounts, Inventory or any other asset of any
Canadian or U.K. Loan Party be applied to reduce the outstanding balance of the
U.S. Obligations.

            (b) The foregoing notwithstanding, so long as no Event of Default
exists and is continuing, except as otherwise provided in subsections 5.4.2 and
7.2.9, if any U.S. Loan Party effects an Asset Sale of a complete (or
substantially complete) business or product line, operating division, or
Subsidiary or operating facility, then the applicable U.S. Loan Party shall,
unless otherwise agreed to by Majority Lenders, pay to Agent for the ratable
benefit of U.S. Lenders as and when received by the applicable Loan Party and as
a mandatory prepayment of the Loans, as herein provided, a sum equal to the
proceeds (net of costs and taxes incurred in connection with such sale and
amounts required to remove Permitted Liens that are prior to the Lien of Agent)
received by the applicable Loan Party from such Asset Sale. Such mandatory
prepayment shall be applied to the Loans as follows: first to installments of
principal due under the Term Notes ratably to be applied to future installments
in inverse order of maturity in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (x)
the outstanding principal balance of the Term Notes


                                       30
<PAGE>

and (y) the sum of seventy percent (70%) of the Appraised Value of the real
Property included within said Asset Sales plus eighty percent (80%) of the
Appraisal Value of the Equipment included within said Asset Sale, second to
repay outstanding principal of U.S. Revolving Loans in an amount equal to the
lesser of (x) the outstanding principal balance of the U.S. Revolving Credit
Loans and (y) the sum of the then applicable advance rate for Eligible Accounts
used in determining the U.S. Borrowing Base multiplied by the amount of Eligible
Accounts included within said Asset Sale plus the then applicable advance rate
for Eligible Inventory used in determining the U.S. Borrowing Base multiplied by
the amount of Eligible Inventory included within said Asset Sale, third to the
installments of principal due under the Term Notes ratably to be applied to
future installment payments in inverse order of maturity, until paid in full and
fourth to repay outstanding principal of U.S. Revolving Credit Loans, until paid
in full.

            3.3.2 Proceeds from Issuance of Additional Indebtedness or Equity.
If any Borrower or any other Loan Party, issues any additional Money Borrowed
(other than Money Borrowed permitted by subsection 7.2.3 of the Agreement) or
obtains any additional equity, in a manner permitted under this Agreement, such
Borrower shall pay, or cause the applicable Loan Party to pay, to the applicable
Agent for the ratable benefit of the applicable Lenders, when and as received by
such Borrower or such Loan Party and as a mandatory prepayment of the
Obligations, a sum equal to 100% of the net proceeds to such Borrower or such
Loan Party of the issuance of such Indebtedness or equity. Any such prepayment
shall be applied to the Loans in the manner specified (x) in the second sentence
of subsection 3.3.1 until payment thereof in full, if such proceeds are received
by a U.S. Loan Party or (y) in the third sentence of subsection 3.3.1 until
payment thereof in full, if such proceeds are received by a Canadian or U.K.
Loan Party.

            3.3.3 LIBOR Portions and Canadian BA Rate Loans. If the application
of any payment made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3 at a
time when no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing would result in
termination of a LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loans prior to the last day
of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Portion or Canadian BA Rate Loans, the
amount of such prepayment shall not be applied to such LIBOR Portion or Canadian
BA Rate Loans, but will, at the applicable Borrower's option, (x) be held by
Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, in the case of LIBOR Portions, and Canadian
Agent, in the case of Canadian BA Rate Loans, in a non-interest bearing account
at Bank or another bank satisfactory to Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, in
the case of LIBOR Portions, and Canadian Agent, in the case of Canadian BA Rate
Loans, in its discretion, which account is in the name of Agent, U.K. Agent or
Canadian Agent, as the case may be, and from which account only Agent, U.K.
Agent or Canadian Agent, as the case may be, can make any withdrawal, or (y)
shall be provisionally applied to outstanding Base Rate Portions or Canadian
Prime Rate Loans, as applicable, in any case to be applied as such amount would
otherwise have been applied under this Section 3.3 at the earlier to occur of
(i) the last day of the relevant Interest Period or (ii) the occurrence of a
Default or an Event of Default.

            3.3.4 Optional Prepayments. U.S. Borrower may, at its option from
time to time upon not less than 3 days prior written notice to Agent, prepay
installments of the Term Notes, provided that the amount of any such prepayment
is at least $500,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000 above $500,000, and
that such prepayments are made ratably with respect to all Term Notes. Each such
prepayment shall be applied to the installments of principal due under the Term
Notes in inverse order of maturity. Except for charges under subsection 3.2.5


                                       31
<PAGE>

applicable to prepayments of LIBOR Term Portions, such prepayments shall be
without premium or penalty.

            3.3.5 Optional Reductions of Revolving Loan Commitments. Borrowers
may, at their option from time to time upon not less than 3 Business Days' prior
written notice to Agent, terminate in whole or permanently reduce ratably in
part, the unused portion of the Revolving Loan Commitments or the U.K. Sublimit
or the Canadian Sublimit; provided, however, that (i) each such partial
reduction shall be in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $5,000,000 or
integral multiples of the Dollar Equivalent of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and
(ii) the aggregate of all optional reductions to the Revolving Credit
Commitments may not exceed the Dollar Equivalent of $10,000,000 during any
12-month period during the Term or the Dollar Equivalent of $30,000,000 during
the Term. Except for charges under subsection 3.2.5 applicable to prepayments of
LIBOR Revolving Portions or Canadian BA Rate Loans, there shall be no prepayment
penalty or termination charge payable in connection with any such reduction in
Revolving Loan Commitments, U.K. Sublimit or Canadian Sublimit.

      3.4 Application of Payments and Collections.

            3.4.1 Collections. All items of payment received at the Appropriate
Payment Office by Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent by 12:00 noon (prevailing
time at the location of the Appropriate Notice Office), on any Business Day
shall be deemed received on that Business Day. All items of payment received
after 12:00 noon (prevailing time at the location of the Appropriate Notice
Office), on any Business Day shall be deemed received on the following Business
Day. If, as the result of collections of Accounts as authorized by subsection
5.2.4 hereof or otherwise, a credit balance exists in the Loan Accounts, to the
extent permitted by the Loan Documents such credit balance shall not accrue
interest in favor of Borrowers, but shall be disbursed to the applicable
Borrower or otherwise at Borrower Representative's direction in the manner set
forth in subsection 3.1.2, upon Borrower Representative's request (at the
Appropriate Notice Office) at any time, so long as no Default or Event of
Default then exists. Agents may, at their option, offset such credit balance
against any of the Obligations upon and during the continuance of an Event of
Default.

            3.4.2 Apportionment, Application and Reversal of Payments. Principal
and interest payments (i) by U.S. Borrower shall be apportioned ratably among
all Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which
such payments relate held by each Lender), (ii) by U.K. Borrower shall be
distributed to U.K. Lender subject to Section 2.6 or, following a refunding in
accordance with Section 3.14, apportioned among all U.K. Participants (according
to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which such payments relate held
by each U.K. Participant) and (iii) by Canadian Borrower shall be distributed to
Canadian Lender subject to Section 2.6 or, following a refunding in accordance
with Section 3.13, apportioned among all Canadian Participants (according to the
unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which such payments relate held by each
Canadian Participant). All payments of principal and interest on Revolving
Credit Loans shall be remitted to Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as
applicable, at the Appropriate Payment Office and all such payments not relating
to principal or interest of specific Loans, or not constituting payment of
specific fees, and all proceeds of Accounts, or, except as provided in
subsection 3.3.1, other Collateral received by Agent, U.K. Agent or Canadian
Agent, as applicable, shall be applied, ratably, subject to the provisions of


                                       32
<PAGE>

this Agreement, first, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements
(other than amounts related to Product Obligations) then due hereunder or under
any of the Loan Documents to Agents or Lenders from the applicable Borrower;
second, to pay interest due from the applicable Borrower in respect of all Loans
made to such Borrower, including Swingline Loans, and Agent Loans; third, to pay
or prepay principal of Swingline Loans and Agent Loans; fourth, to pay or prepay
principal of the Revolving Credit Loans (other than Swingline Loans and Agent
Loans) and unpaid reimbursement obligations in respect of LC Obligations of the
applicable Borrower; fifth, if an Event of Default exists and is continuing, to
cash-collateralize the U.S. LC Obligations, Canadian LC Obligations and U.K. LC
Obligations of such Borrower by depositing in a cash collateral account
established with the Agent on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Agent an
amount in cash equal to 103% of the aggregate amount of such Obligations; sixth,
to pay or prepay principal of the Term Loan; seventh, to the payment of any
other Obligation (other than amounts related to Product Obligations) due to
Agents by such Borrower; eighth, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense
reimbursements related to, or any other amounts owing any Lender or any Agent by
any Borrower with respect to, Product Obligations of such Borrower; and ninth,
in the case of (x) payments by U.K. Borrower, to the payment of any other
Obligations due to Canadian Agent or Canadian Lender by Canadian Borrower, (y)
payments by Canadian Borrower, to the payment of any other Obligations due to
U.K. Agent or any Lender by U.K. Borrower and (z) payments by U.S. Borrower, to
the payment of any other Obligations due to Agents or any Lender by U.S.
Borrower, U.K. Borrower or Canadian Borrower, ratably. Except as expressly set
forth to the contrary, payments received (i) from U.S. Borrower shall be applied
only to the U.S. Obligations, (ii) from the U.K. Borrower shall be applied only
to the U.K. Obligations, and (iii) from Canadian Borrower shall be applied only
to the Canadian Obligations; provided that after the U.S. Obligations, U.K.
Obligations or Canadian Obligations are paid in full by U.S. Borrower, U.K.
Borrower or Canadian Borrower, respectively, any such excess payments shall be
applied pro rata to the other Obligations (except that any payments received
from U.K. Borrower or Canadian Borrower shall not be applied to the U.S.
Obligations). After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, as between Agents and Borrowers, Agents shall have the continuing
exclusive right to apply and reapply any and all such payments and collections
received at any time or times hereafter by Agents against the Obligations, in
such manner as Agents may deem advisable, notwithstanding any entry by Agents or
any Lender upon any of its books and records. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, as between Agents and other Lenders, all such payments shall be
applied in the order set forth above.

      3.5 All Loans to Constitute One Obligation. Except as set forth in Section
1.3 to the contrary and for the purpose of being ratably secured by Agents'
Liens upon all of the Collateral, the Loans and LC Obligations shall constitute
one general Obligation of Borrowers; provided, however, that the U.K. Collateral
and the Canadian Collateral shall not secure the U.S. Obligations.

      3.6 Loan Accounts; Registration.

                  (a) Agent shall enter all Loans and the LC Amount as debits to
      a loan account established for each Borrower (each, a "Loan Account" and,
      collectively, the "Loan Accounts") and shall also record in the Loan
      Accounts all payments made by Borrowers on any Obligations and all
      proceeds of Collateral which are finally paid to


                                       33
<PAGE>

      Agents and may record therein, in accordance with customary accounting
      practice, other debits and credits, including interest and all charges and
      expenses properly chargeable to Borrowers.

                  (b) Agent shall, on behalf of each Borrower, maintain at its
      address a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to it
      and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and
      addresses of the Lenders and the Revolving Loan Commitment of, and the
      principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The
      entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest
      error, and Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person
      whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Loan and any
      Notes evidencing the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this
      Agreement. Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced
      by a Note shall be registered on the Register and be effective only upon
      surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note
      evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and
      Acceptance Agreement and thereupon one or more new Notes shall be issued
      to the designated assignee. The Register shall be available for inspection
      by Borrowers or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time
      upon reasonable prior notice.

      3.7 Statements of Account. Agent will account to Borrower Representative,
on behalf of Borrowers, monthly with a statement of Loans, charges and payments
made pursuant to this Agreement during the immediately preceding month, and such
account rendered by Agent shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon
Borrowers absent demonstrable error unless Agent is notified by Borrower
Representative at the Appropriate Notice Office in writing to the contrary
within 30 days of the date each accounting is received by Borrower
Representative. Such notice shall be deemed an objection only to those items
specifically objected to therein.

      3.8 Increased Costs. If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental
rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) adopted or implemented after the date of this Agreement and having
general applicability to all banks or finance companies within the jurisdiction
in which any Lender operates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the effect
of and phasing in of capital requirements or other regulations or guidelines
passed prior to the date of this Agreement), or any interpretation or
application thereof by any governmental authority charged with the
interpretation or application thereof, or the compliance of such Lender
therewith, shall:

                  (i) (1) subject such Lender to any tax with respect to this
            Agreement (other than (a) any tax based on or measured by net income
            or otherwise in the nature of a net income tax, including, without
            limitation, any franchise tax or any similar tax based on capital,
            net worth or comparable basis for measurement and (b) subject to the
            provisions of Section 2.12, any tax collected by a withholding on
            payments and which neither is computed by reference to the net
            income of the payee nor is in the nature of an advance collection of
            a tax based on or measured by the net income of the payee) or (2)
            change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender of
            principal, fees, interest or any other amount payable hereunder or
            under any Loan Documents (other than in respect of (a) any tax based
            on or measured by net income or otherwise in the nature of a net
            income tax, including,


                                       34
<PAGE>

            without limitation, any franchise tax or any similar tax based on
            capital, net worth or comparable basis for measurement and (b)
            subject to the provisions of Section 2.12, any tax collected by a
            withholding on payments and which neither is computed by reference
            to the net income of the payee nor is in the nature of an advance
            collection of a tax based on or measured by the net income of the
            payee);

                  (ii) impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve (except any
            reserve taken into account in the determination of the applicable
            LIBOR), special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against
            assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, advances or
            loans by, or other credit extended by, any office of such Lender,
            including (without limitation) pursuant to Regulation D of the Board
            of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or

                  (iii) impose on such Lender or the London interbank market or
            the Canadian BA market any other condition with respect to any Loan
            Document;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making, renewing or maintaining Loans hereunder or the result of any of the
foregoing is to reduce the rate of return on such Lender's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder, or the result of any of the foregoing
is to reduce the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise) in respect of any of the Loans, then, in any such case, the
applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender, upon demand and certification not
later than sixty (60) days following its receipt of notice of the imposition of
such increased costs, such additional amount as will compensate such Lender for
such additional cost or such reduction (other than any additional cost or
reduction that results from taxes that are not Tax Liabilities), as the case may
be, to the extent such Lender has not otherwise been compensated, with respect
to a particular Loan, for such increased cost as a result of an increase in the
Base Rate, Canadian Prime Rate, the LIBOR or Canadian BA Rate. An officer of the
applicable Lender shall determine the amount of such additional cost or reduced
amount using reasonable averaging and attribution methods and shall certify the
amount of such additional cost or reduced amount to Borrower Representative,
which certification shall include a written explanation of such additional cost
or reduction to such Borrower. Such certification shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. If a Lender claims any additional cost or reduced amount
pursuant to this Section 3.8, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts
(consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different
lending office or to file any certificate or document reasonably requested by
Borrower Representative at the Appropriate Notice Office, if the making of such
designation or filing would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any
such additional cost or reduced amount and would not, in the sole discretion of
such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. The foregoing
notwithstanding, Borrowers shall not be liable for any additional cost or
reduced amount otherwise due pursuant to this Section 3.8, if the applicable
Lender does not notify Borrowers of any such additional cost or reduced amount
within 90 days after the date the applicable Lender becomes aware of any such
additional cost or reduced amount.

      3.9 Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate. In the event that
Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent or any Lender shall have determined that:


                                       35
<PAGE>

                  (i) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR
            for any Interest Period or the Canadian BA Rate for any term; or

                  (ii) Sterling, Euro or Dollar deposits in the relevant amount
            and for the relevant maturity are not available in the London
            interbank market with respect to a proposed LIBOR Portion, or that a
            market does not exist for Canadian BA Rate Loans, or a proposed
            conversion of a Base Rate Portion into a LIBOR Portion or a Canadian
            Prime Rate Loan into a Canadian BA Rate Loan; then

Agent, Canadian Agent, U.K. Agent or such Lender, as applicable, shall give
Borrower Representative prompt written, telephonic or electronic notice of the
determination of such effect. If such notice is given, (i) any such requested
LIBOR Portion (in the affected currency, if not all applicable currencies are
affected) shall be made as a Base Rate Portion, unless Borrower Representative
shall notify Agent at the Appropriate Notice Office no later than 10:00 a.m.
(prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice Office) three (3)
Business Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing that the request for
such borrowing shall be canceled or made as an unaffected type of LIBOR Portion,
(ii) any Base Rate Portion which was to have been converted to an affected type
of LIBOR Portion shall be continued as or converted into a Base Rate Portion,
or, if Borrower Representative shall notify Agent at the Appropriate Notice
Office, no later than 10:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the location of the
Appropriate Notice Office) three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed
conversion, shall be maintained as an unaffected type of LIBOR Portion, (iii)
any such requested Canadian BA Rate Loan shall be made as a Canadian Prime Rate
Loan, unless Borrower Representative shall notify Canadian Agent at the
Appropriate Notice Office no later than 10:00 a.m. (prevailing time in the
location of the Appropriate Notice Office), three (3) Business Days prior to the
date of such proposed borrowing that the request for such borrowing shall be
canceled and (iv) any Canadian Prime Rate Loan which was to have been converted
to an affected type of Canadian BA Rate Loan shall be continued as or converted
into a Canadian Prime Rate Loans, or, if Borrower Representative shall notify
Canadian Agent at the Appropriate Notice Office, no later than 10:00 a.m.
(prevailing time in the location of the Appropriate Notice Office) three (3)
Business Days prior to the proposed conversion, shall be maintained as an
unaffected type of Canadian BA Rate Loan.

      3.10 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If (i) any Lender shall obtain any payment
(whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off,
or otherwise) on account of its U.S. Obligations made by it in excess of its
ratable share of payments on account of all U.S. Obligations of all Lenders,
such Lender shall forthwith purchase from each other Lender of such Loan such
participation in such Loan as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender
to share the excess payment ratably with each other Lender; provided, that, if
all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
applicable purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded
and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lenders the purchase price to the
extent of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable
share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. Subject to Section 2.12, Borrowers agree that
any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this
Section 3.10 may, to the fullest extent


                                       36
<PAGE>

permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the
direct creditor of the applicable Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all purchases and
repayments to be made under this Section 3.10 shall be made through Agent.

      3.11 Location of Payments and Notices. Notwithstanding anything else
herein to the contrary, all payments made by Borrowers or Borrower
Representative on behalf of Borrowers under this Agreement, whether principal or
interest payments, fees, expenses or other charges hereunder, shall be made at
the Appropriate Payment Office and all notices made by Borrowers or Borrower
Representative on behalf of Borrowers under this Agreement shall be made at the
Appropriate Notice Office.

      3.12 Appointment of Borrower Representative. Each Borrower hereby
designates Katy Industries, Inc. as its representative ("Borrower
Representative") and agent on its behalf for the purposes of issuing all notices
(including, without limitation, notices of borrowing), giving instructions with
respect to the disbursement of the proceeds of the Loans, selecting interest
rate options, requesting Letters of Credit or LC Guaranties, giving and
receiving all other notices and consents hereunder or under any of the other
Loan Documents and taking all other actions (including in respect of compliance
with covenants) on behalf of any Borrower or Borrowers under the Loan Documents.
Katy Industries, Inc. hereby accepts such appointment. Agents may regard any
notice or other communications pursuant to any Loan Document from Katy
Industries, Inc. as a notice or communication from all Borrowers, and may give
any notice or communication required or permitted to be given to any Borrower or
Borrowers hereby to Katy Industries, Inc. on behalf of such Borrower or
Borrowers. Each Borrower agrees that each notice, election, representation and
warranty, covenant, agreement and undertaking made on its behalf by Katy
Industries, Inc. shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made by such
Borrower and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Borrower or
Borrowers, as applicable, to the same extent as if the same had been made
directly by such Borrower or Borrowers, as applicable. Borrowers shall have the
right to designate a replacement Borrower Representative from time to time upon
written notice to the Agents. Borrower Representative hereby authorizes and
appoints (x) CML (who hereby accepts such appointment) as its agent solely for
purposes of giving notices of borrowings or letter of credit requests to the
U.K. Agent with respect to U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and (y) Woods Canada (who
hereby accepts such appointment) as its agent solely for the purposes of giving
notices of borrowings or letter of credit requests to the Canadian Agent with
respect to Canadian Revolving Credit Loans.

      3.13 Canadian Revolving Credit Loans Refunding.

                  (a) If any Default or Event of Default shall occur and be
      continuing or upon 30 days' written notice, Canadian Lender may, in its
      sole and absolute discretion, direct that the Canadian Revolving Credit
      Loans owing to it be refunded by delivering a notice (with such detail as
      Agent shall request, a "Notice of Canadian Revolving Loan Refunding") to
      Agent. Upon receipt of such notice, Agent shall promptly give notice of
      the contents thereof to the Canadian Participants at their respective
      Facility Offices and, unless an Event of Default described in subsection
      9.1.8 shall have occurred, to each Borrower. Each such Notice of Canadian
      Revolving Credit Loan Refunding shall be deemed to constitute delivery of
      a notice to Agent requesting each Canadian Participant


                                       37
<PAGE>

      to fund its undivided Participating Interest in the outstanding Canadian
      Revolving Credit Loans whereupon each Canadian Participant, through its
      Facility Office, shall fund a pro rata portion of the outstanding Canadian
      Revolving Credit Loans and related Obligations in an amount equal to the
      Canadian Participant's Revolving Loan Percentage of the aggregate
      principal amount of such Canadian Revolving Credit Loans held by each
      corresponding Lender to which the Canadian Participant is affiliated;
      provided that, with respect to the Canadian LC Obligations, the Canadian
      Participant is not required to fund the Revolving Loan Percentage
      attributable to the Canadian LC Obligations until such time as the
      underlying Canadian Letter of Credit or Canadian Letter of Credit
      supported by a Canadian LC Guaranty has been drawn. Subject to the proviso
      in the immediately preceding sentence, each Canadian Participant shall
      immediately (or at the option of Canadian Lender, on a weekly or other
      basis) transfer (or, if applicable, shall cause its Canadian Affiliate to
      transfer) to Canadian Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount
      of its Participating Interest in the same currency as the underlying
      Revolving Credit Loan that was made by Canadian Lender.

                  (b) Whenever, at any time after a Canadian Participant has
      funded a pro rata portion of the outstanding Canadian Revolving Credit
      Loans and related Obligations in accordance with Section 3.13(c), Canadian
      Lender receives any payment on account thereof, Canadian Lender will
      distribute to Agent for delivery to each Canadian Participant its
      Participating Interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case
      of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
      Canadian Participant's Participating Interest was outstanding and funded);
      provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by
      Canadian Lender is required to be returned, such Canadian Participant will
      return to Agent for delivery to Canadian Lender any portion thereof
      previously delivered by Agent or Canadian Lender to it. For purposes of
      Section 2.12, any interest distributed by Canadian Lender to a Canadian
      Participant shall be deemed to have been paid by the Canadian Borrower.

                  (c) Each Canadian Participant's obligation to fund the pro
      rata portion of the outstanding Canadian Revolving Credit Loans and
      related Obligations referred to in this Section 3.13 shall be absolute and
      unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including,
      without limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
      other right which such Canadian Participant or any Borrower may have
      against Canadian Lender, any Canadian Participant, any Borrower or any
      other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance
      of a Default or Event of Default, (iii) any adverse change in the
      condition (financial or otherwise) of any Borrower, (iv) any breach of
      this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any Borrower or any other
      Lender or Canadian Participant, or (v) any other circumstances, happening
      or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

      3.14 U.K. Revolving Credit Loans Refunding.

                  (a) If any Default or Event of Default shall occur and be
      continuing or upon 30 days' written notice, U.K. Lender may, in its sole
      and absolute discretion, direct that the U.K. Revolving Credit Loans owing
      to it be refunded by delivering a notice (with such detail as Agent shall
      request, a "Notice of U.K. Revolving Loan Refunding") to


                                       38
<PAGE>

      Agent. Upon receipt of such notice, Agent shall promptly give notice of
      the contents thereof to the U.K. Participants at their respective Facility
      Office and, unless an Event of Default described in subsection 9.1.8 shall
      have occurred, to each Borrower. Each such Notice of U.K. Revolving Credit
      Loan Refunding shall be deemed to constitute delivery of a notice to Agent
      requesting each U.K. Participant fund its undivided U.K. Participating
      Interest in the outstanding U.K. Revolving Credit Loans whereupon each
      U.K. Participant, through its Facility Office, shall fund (or, if such
      Lender has a U.K. Affiliate, shall cause its U.K. Affiliate to fund) a pro
      rata portion of the outstanding U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and related
      Obligations in an amount equal to the U.K. Participant's Revolving Loan
      Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of such U.K. Revolving Credit
      Loans held by each corresponding Lender to which the U.K. Participant is
      affiliated; provided that, with respect to the U.K. LC Obligations, the
      U.K. Participant is not required to fund the Revolving Loan Percentage
      attributable to the U.K. LC Obligations until such time as the underlying
      U.K. Letter of Credit or U.K. Letter of Credit supported by a U.K. LC
      Guaranty has been drawn. Subject to the proviso in the immediately
      preceding sentence, each U.K. Participant shall immediately (or at the
      option of U.K. Lender, on a weekly or other basis) transfer to (or, if
      applicable, shall cause its U.K. Affiliate to transfer) U.K. Lender, in
      immediately available funds, the amount of its U.K. Participating Interest
      in the same currency as the underlying Revolving Credit Loan or U.K.
      Letter of Credit or U.K. LC Guaranty was made or issued by U.K. Lender,
      unless otherwise advised by Agent.

                  (b) Whenever, at any time after a U.K. Participant has funded
      a pro rata portion of the outstanding U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and
      related Obligations, U.K. Lender receives any payment on account thereof,
      U.K. Lender will distribute to Agent for delivery to each U.K. Participant
      its Participating Interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the
      case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
      U.K. Participant's Participating Interest was outstanding and funded);
      provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by U.K.
      Lender is required to be returned, such U.K. Participant will return to
      Agent for delivery to U.K. Lender any portion thereof previously delivered
      by Agent or U.K. Lender to it.

                  (c) Each U.K. Participant's obligation to fund the pro rata
      portion of the outstanding U.K. Revolving Credit Loans and related
      Obligations referred to in this Section 3.14 shall be absolute and
      unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including,
      without limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
      other right which such U.K. Participant or any Borrower may have against
      U.K. Lender, any U.K. Participant, any Borrower or any other Person for
      any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or
      Event of Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or
      otherwise) of any Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other
      Loan Document by any Borrower or any other Lender or U.K. Participant, or
      (v) any other circumstances, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
      similar to any of the foregoing.

      3.15 Mitigation Obligations. If a Lender claims any additional cost or
reduced amount pursuant to Section 3.8, or any Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount or indemnity to any Lender, Participant or Canadian
Participant or U.K. Participant or any governmental


                                       39
<PAGE>

authority for the account of any Lender or Canadian Participant or U.K.
Participant pursuant to Section 2.12 of the Agreement, then such Lender,
Participant or Canadian Participant or U.K. Participant shall use reasonable
efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a
different lending office or to file any certificate or document reasonably
requested by Borrower Representative at the Appropriate Notice Office or to
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches
or affiliates, if the making of such designation, filing or assignment would
avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional cost or reduced
amount or additional amount an would not, in the bona fide discretion of such
Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender, Participant or Canadian
Participant or U.K. Participant; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
obligate a U.S. Lender to transfer the Canadian Participation or Canadian
Revolving Credit Loans or the U.K. Participation or U.K. Revolving Credit Loans
(following a funding under Section 3.13) to its Canadian or United Kingdom
office or Affiliate. In the event that the provisions of Sections 2.12 or 3.8 of
the Agreement result in the effective interest rates being charged by or with
respect to any Lender to Borrowers being increased, on a per annum basis, by
more than one quarter percent (1/4%), or if any Lender defaults on its
obligations to make Revolving Credit Loans hereunder, Borrowers may require any
such Lender (an "Affected Lender") to sell and transfer all of its interest in
this Agreement and its Notes to a substitute Lender (who shall be reasonably
acceptable to Agent) for a price in cash equal to the principal balance of such
Affected Lender's outstanding Loans plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon
plus all accrued but unpaid fees due any such Affected Lender under the terms
hereof. Any such sale and transfer shall be made pursuant to the terms of
Section 10.9 hereof.

                         SECTION 4. TERM AND TERMINATION

      4.1 Term of Agreement. Subject to the right of Lenders to cease making
Loans to Borrower during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default,
this Agreement shall be in effect for a period of five (5) years from the date
hereof, through and including January 30, 2008 (the "Term"), unless terminated
as provided in Section 4.2 hereof.

      4.2 Termination.

            4.2.1 Termination by Lenders. Agent may, and at the direction of
Majority Lenders shall, terminate this Agreement without notice upon or after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or a Change in
Control.

            4.2.2 Termination by Borrower Representative. Upon at least three
(3) days prior written notice to Agent and Lenders, Borrower Representative may,
at its option, terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
termination shall be effective until Borrowers have paid or collateralized to
Agent's reasonable satisfaction all of the Obligations in immediately available
funds, all Letters of Credit and LC Guaranties have expired, terminated or have
been cash collateralized to Agent's reasonable satisfaction and Borrowers have
complied with Section 2.6 and subsection 3.2.5. Any notice of termination given
by Borrower Representative shall be irrevocable unless all Lenders otherwise
agree in writing and no Lender shall have any obligation to make any Loans or
issue or procure any Letters of Credit or LC Guaranties on or after the
termination date stated in such notice. Borrowers may elect to


                                       40
<PAGE>

terminate this Agreement in its entirety only. No section of this Agreement or
type of Loan available hereunder may be terminated singly.

            4.2.3 Effect of Termination. All of the Obligations shall be
immediately due and payable upon the termination date stated in any notice of
termination of this Agreement. All undertakings, agreements, covenants,
warranties and representations of Borrowers contained in the Loan Documents
shall survive any such termination and Agent shall retain its Liens in the
Collateral and Agents and each Lender shall retain all of its rights and
remedies under the Loan Documents notwithstanding such termination until all
Obligations have been discharged or paid or cash collateralized to Agent's
satisfaction, in full, in immediately available funds, including, without
limitation, all Obligations under Section 2.6 and subsection 3.2.5 resulting
from such termination; provided, that the Lien on the Canadian Collateral and
the U.K. Collateral shall be released once all U.K. Obligations and Canadian
Obligations have been discharged and paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or the payment in full of the Obligations, Agents shall not be required to
terminate their Liens in the Collateral unless, with respect to any loss or
damage Agents may incur as a result of dishonored checks or other items of
payment received by Agents from any Borrower or any Account Debtor and applied
to the Obligations, Agent shall, at its option, (i) have received a written
agreement satisfactory to Agent, executed by Borrowers and by any Person whose
loans or other advances to Borrowers are used in whole or in part to satisfy the
Obligations, indemnifying Agent and each Lender from any such loss or damage or
(ii) have retained cash Collateral or other Collateral for such period of time
as Agent, in its reasonable discretion, may deem necessary to protect Agent,
Canadian Agent, U.K. Agent and each Lender from any such loss or damage.

                      SECTION 5. COLLATERAL ADMINISTRATION

      5.1 General.

            5.1.1 Location of Collateral. All Collateral, other than Inventory
in transit and motor vehicles, will at all times be kept by each Borrower and
its Subsidiaries at one or more of the business locations set forth in Exhibit
5.1.1 hereto, as updated by Borrowers providing prior written notice to Agent of
any new location.

            5.1.2 Insurance of Collateral. Each Borrower shall maintain and pay
for insurance upon all Collateral wherever located and with respect to the
business of each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries, covering casualty,
hazard, public liability, workers' compensation and such other risks in such
amounts and with such insurance companies as are reasonably satisfactory to
Agent. Borrower Representative shall deliver certificates of insurance or
certified copies of such policies to Agent as promptly as practicable, with
satisfactory lender's loss payable endorsements, naming Agent, Canadian Agent or
U.K. Agent, as applicable, as a loss payee, assignee or additional insured, as
appropriate, as its interest may appear, and showing only such other loss
payees, assignees and additional insureds as are satisfactory to Agent. Each
policy of insurance or endorsement shall contain a clause requiring the insurer
to give not less than 10 days' prior written notice to Agent in the event of
cancellation of the policy for nonpayment of premium and not less than 30 days'
prior written notice to Agent in the event of cancellation of the policy for any
other reason whatsoever and a clause specifying that the interest of Agent shall
not be impaired or invalidated by any act or neglect of any Borrower, any


                                       41
<PAGE>

Subsidiary of any Borrower or the owner of the Property or by the occupation of
the premises for purposes more hazardous than are permitted by said policy.
Borrower Representative agrees to deliver to Agent, promptly upon request of
Agent, true copies of all reports made in any reporting forms to insurance
companies. All proceeds of business interruption insurance (if any) of any
Borrower or its Subsidiaries shall be remitted to the applicable Agent for
application to the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Loans.

            Unless Borrowers provide Agent with evidence of the insurance
coverage required by this Agreement, Agent may purchase insurance at the
applicable Borrower's expense to protect Agents' interests in the Properties of
Borrowers and their Subsidiaries. This insurance may, but need not, protect the
interests of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries. The coverage that Agent purchases
may not pay any claim that any Borrower or any Subsidiary makes or any claim
that is made against any Borrower or any such Subsidiary in connection with said
Property. Borrowers may later cancel any insurance purchased by Agent, but only
after providing Agent with evidence that Borrowers and their Subsidiaries have
obtained insurance as required by this Agreement. If Agent purchases insurance,
the applicable Borrower will be responsible for the costs of that insurance,
including interest and any other charges Agents may impose in connection with
the placement of insurance, until the effective date of the cancellation or
expiration of the insurance. The costs of the insurance may be added to the
Obligations. The costs of the insurance may be more than the cost of insurance
that Borrowers and their Subsidiaries may be able to obtain on their own.

            5.1.3 Protection of Collateral. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall
be liable or responsible in any way for the safekeeping of any of the Collateral
or for any loss or damage thereto (except for reasonable care in the custody
thereof while any Collateral is in any Agent's or any Lender's actual
possession) or for any diminution in the value thereof, or for any act or
default of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency or other person
whomsoever, but the same shall be at the applicable Borrower's or the applicable
Loan Party's sole risk.

      5.2 Administration of Accounts.

            5.2.1 Records, Schedules and Assignments of Accounts. Borrowers
shall, and shall cause each other Loan Party to, keep accurate and complete
records of its Accounts and all payments and collections thereon. Concurrently
with the delivery of each Borrowing Base Certificate described in subsection
7.1.4, or more frequently as reasonably requested by Agent, from and after the
date hereof, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent a summary aged trial balance of
all Accounts of Borrowers and each other Loan Party. Annually, or more
frequently as requested by Agent if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent a report specifying the names,
addresses, face values, dates of invoices and due dates for each Account Debtor
obligated on an Account so listed ("Schedule of Accounts"), and upon Agent's
request therefor, copies of proof of delivery and the original copy of all
documents, including, without limitation, repayment histories and present status
reports relating to the Accounts so scheduled and such other matters and
information relating to the status of then existing Accounts as Agent shall
reasonably request. If requested by Agent, Borrowers shall, and shall cause each
other Loan Party to, execute and deliver to Agent formal written assignments of
all of its Accounts monthly, weekly or daily, which shall include all Accounts
that have been created


                                       42
<PAGE>

since the date of the last assignment, together with copies of invoices or
invoice registers related thereto.

            5.2.2 Discounts, Allowances, Disputes. If any Borrower or any other
Loan Party grants any discounts, allowances or credits that are not shown on the
face of the invoice for the Account involved, Borrowers shall report such
discounts, allowances or credits, as the case may be, to Agent as part of the
next required Borrowing Base Certificate.

            5.2.3 Account Verification. Any of Agent's officers, employees or
agents shall have the right, at any time or times hereafter, in the name of
Agent, any designee of Agent, any Borrower or any other Loan Party, to verify
the validity, amount or any other matter relating to any Accounts by mail,
telephone, electronic communication or otherwise. Borrowers shall, and shall
cause each other Loan Party to, cooperate fully with Agent in an effort to
facilitate and promptly conclude any such verification process.

            5.2.4 Maintenance of Dominion Account. Each Borrower shall, and
shall cause each other Loan Party to, maintain a Dominion Account or Accounts
pursuant to lockbox and blocked account arrangements acceptable to the Agent,
the Canadian Agent or the U.K. Agent, as applicable, with such banks as may be
selected by Borrower Representative and be acceptable to the applicable Agent;
provided that in the case of U.K. Borrower, such Dominion Account(s) shall be
maintained at Fleet U.K. Such blocked account and lockbox arrangements shall
provide for full dominion and control of each Borrower's and each other Loan
Party's cash deposited into all deposit accounts. Each Borrower shall issue to
any such banks an irrevocable letter of instruction directing such banks to
deposit all payments or other remittances received in the lockbox and blocked
accounts to the Dominion Account for application on account of the Obligations
as provided in subsection 3.2.1. All funds deposited in any Dominion Account
shall immediately become the property of the applicable Agent, for the ratable
benefit of the applicable Lenders, and the applicable Borrower shall obtain, or
shall cause the applicable Loan Party to obtain, the agreement by such banks in
favor of the applicable Agent to waive any recoupment, setoff rights, and any
security interest in, or against, the funds so deposited. No Agent assumes any
responsibility for such lockbox and blocked account arrangements, including,
without limitation, any claim of accord and satisfaction or release with respect
to deposits accepted by any bank thereunder.

            5.2.5 Collection of Accounts, Proceeds of Collateral. Each Borrower
agrees that all invoices rendered and other requests made by any Borrower or any
other Loan Party for payment in respect of Accounts shall contain a written
statement directing payment in respect of such Accounts to be paid to a lockbox
established pursuant to subsection 5.2.4. To expedite collection, Borrowers
shall endeavor, and shall cause each other Loan Party to endeavor, in the first
instance to make collection of its Accounts for Agents. All remittances received
by any Borrower or any Loan Party on account of Accounts, together with the
proceeds of any other Collateral, shall be held as Agent's, Canadian Agent's or
U.K. Agent's, as the case may be, property, for its benefit and the benefit of
the applicable Lenders, by the applicable Borrower or such Loan Party as trustee
of an express trust for Agent's, Canadian Agent's or U.K. Agent's benefit, as
applicable, and the applicable Borrower shall, or shall cause the applicable
Loan Party to, immediately deposit same in kind in the Dominion Account. Agents
retain the right at all times after the occurrence and during the continuance of
a Default or an Event of Default to


                                       43
<PAGE>

notify Account Debtors that Borrowers' and each other Loan Party's Accounts have
been assigned to Agents and to collect Borrowers' or any Loan Party's Accounts
directly in its own name, or in the name of any Agent's agent, and to charge the
collection costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, to the applicable
Borrower.

            5.2.6 Taxes. If an Account includes a charge for any tax payable to
any governmental taxing authority, Agents are authorized, in their sole
discretion, to pay the amount thereof to the proper taxing authority for the
account of the applicable Borrower and to charge such Borrower therefor, except
for taxes that (i) are being actively contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings and with respect to which the applicable Borrower or the applicable
Loan Party maintains reasonable reserves on its books therefor and (ii) would
not reasonably be expected to result in any Lien other than a Permitted Lien. In
no event shall any Agent or any Lender be liable for any taxes to any
governmental taxing authority that may be due by any Borrower or any other Loan
Party.

      5.3 Administration of Inventory. Each Borrower shall keep, and shall cause
each other Loan Party to keep, records of its Inventory which records shall be
complete and accurate in all material respects. Borrowers shall furnish to Agent
Inventory reports concurrently with the delivery of each Borrowing Base
Certificate described in subsection 7.1.4 or more frequently as reasonably
requested by Agent, which reports will be in such other format and detail as
Agent shall reasonably request and shall include a current list of all locations
of Borrowers' and each other Loan Party's Inventory, together with such
supporting information as Agent shall reasonably request. Borrowers shall
conduct a physical inventory no less frequently than annually or, in lieu of a
physical inventory, shall conduct cycle counts of Inventory.

      5.4 Administration of Equipment.

            5.4.1 Records and Schedules of Equipment. Each Borrower shall keep,
and shall cause each other Loan Party to keep, records of its Equipment which
shall be complete and accurate in all material respects itemizing and describing
the kind, type, quality, quantity and book value of its Equipment and all
dispositions made in accordance with subsection 5.4.2 hereof, and each Borrower
shall, and shall cause each other Loan Party to, furnish Agent with a current
schedule containing the foregoing information on at least an annual basis and
more often if reasonably requested by Agent. Promptly after the request therefor
by Agent, each Borrower shall deliver, or cause each other Loan Party to
deliver, to Agent any and all evidence of ownership, if any, of any Equipment of
any Borrower or any other Loan Party.

            5.4.2 Dispositions of Equipment. Borrowers shall not, and shall not
permit any other Loan Party to, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of or transfer
any of their or its respective Equipment or other fixed assets or any part
thereof without the prior written consent of Agent, except as otherwise
expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement, including without
limitation, subsection 7.2.9 of the Agreement.

      5.5 Payment of Charges. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under Section
5 hereof shall be Obligations secured by all of the Collateral (except that
amounts chargeable to U.S. Borrower shall not be secured by U.K. Collateral or
Canadian Collateral), shall be payable on demand by the applicable Borrower and
shall bear interest from the date such advance was


                                       44
<PAGE>

made until paid in full at the rate applicable to the Base Rate Revolving
Portions (or in the case of Canadian Borrower, Canadian Prime Rate Loans) from
time to time.

      5.6 Lien on Realty. The due and punctual performance of the Canadian
Obligations, the U.K. Obligations and/or the U.S. Obligations shall also be
secured by the Lien created by the Mortgages upon the real Property of the
Borrowers and other Loan Parties described therein; provided that the Liens
created by any Mortgage upon the real Property of any Canadian Loan Party or
U.K. Loan Party shall not secure the U.S. Obligations. If any Borrower or any
other Loan Party shall acquire at any time or times hereafter any fee simple
interest in other real Property (other than leasehold interests in sales offices
or warehouses), the applicable Borrower agrees promptly to execute and deliver
to the applicable Agent, or to cause the applicable Loan Party to execute and
deliver to the applicable Agent, for its benefit and the ratable benefit of the
applicable Lenders, as additional security and Collateral for the Obligations,
deeds of trust, security deeds, mortgages or other collateral assignments
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Agent and its counsel (herein
collectively referred to as "New Mortgages") covering such real Property;
provided that the Liens created by any New Mortgages on the real Property of any
Canadian Loan Party or U.K. Loan Party shall not secure the U.S. Obligations.
The Mortgages and each New Mortgage shall be duly recorded (at the applicable
Borrower's expense) in each office where such recording is required to
constitute a valid Lien on the real Property covered thereby. In respect to any
Mortgage or any New Mortgage, the applicable Borrower shall deliver to Agent, or
shall cause the applicable Loan Party to deliver to Agent, at the applicable
Borrower's expense, mortgagee title insurance policies issued by a title
insurance company reasonably satisfactory to Agent, which policies shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent and shall insure a valid
Lien in favor of the applicable Agent for the benefit of itself and each
applicable Lender on the Property covered thereby, subject only to Permitted
Liens and those other exceptions reasonably acceptable to Agent and its counsel.
Such Borrower shall also deliver, or shall cause the applicable Loan Party to
deliver, to Agent such other usual and customary documents, including, without
limitation, ALTA Surveys of the real Property described in the Mortgages or any
New Mortgage, as Agent and its counsel may reasonably request relating to the
real Property subject to the Mortgages or the New Mortgages.

the other Loan Documents when delivered under this Agreement will be, a legal,

Properties that is not a Permitted Lien. The Liens granted to Agents under the
Security Documents are First Priority Liens, subject only to Permitted Liens.

            6.1.8 Accounts. Agent may rely, in determining which Accounts are
Eligible Accounts, on all statements and representations made by Borrowers and
each other Loan Party with respect to any Account or Accounts. With respect to
each of each Borrower's and each other Loan Party's Accounts, whether or not
such Account is an Eligible Account, unless otherwise disclosed to Agent in the
appropriate Borrowing Base Certificate or schedule:

                  (i) It is genuine and in all respects what it purports to be,
            and it is not evidenced by a judgment;

                  (ii) It arises out of a completed, bona fide sale and delivery
            of goods or rendition of services by a Borrower or a Loan Party, in
            the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with the terms
            and conditions of all purchase


                                       47
<PAGE>

            orders, contracts or other documents relating thereto and forming a
            part of the contract between the applicable Borrower or Loan Party
            and the Account Debtor;

                  (iii) It is for a liquidated amount maturing as stated in the
            duplicate invoice covering such sale or rendition of services, a
            copy of which has been furnished or is available to Agent;

                  (iv) There are no facts, events or occurrences which in any
            way impair the validity or enforceability of any Accounts or could
            reasonably be expected to reduce the amount payable thereunder from
            the face amount of the invoice and statements delivered or made
            available to Agent with respect thereto;

                  (v) To the best of Borrowers' knowledge, the Account Debtor
            thereunder (1) had the capacity to contract at the time any contract
            or other document giving rise to the Account was executed and (2)
            such Account Debtor is Solvent; and

                  (vi) To the best of Borrowers' knowledge, there are no
            proceedings or actions which are threatened or pending against the
            Account Debtor thereunder which, in Borrowers' reasonable judgment,
            would likely result in any material adverse change in such Account
            Debtor's financial condition or the collectibility of such Account.

            6.1.9 Equipment. The Equipment of each Borrower and its Subsidiaries
is in good operating condition and repair, and all necessary replacements of and
repairs thereto shall be made so that the operating efficiency thereof shall be
maintained and preserved, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Neither any
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries will permit any Equipment to become affixed
to any real Property leased to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries so that
an interest arises therein under the real estate laws of the applicable
jurisdiction unless the landlord of such real Property has executed a landlord
waiver or leasehold mortgage in favor of and in form reasonably acceptable to
Agent, and no Borrower will permit any of the Equipment of any Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries to become an accession to any personal Property other than
Equipment that is subject to First Priority (except for Permitted Liens) Liens
in favor of Agents.

            6.1.10 Financial Statements; Fiscal Year. The Consolidated and
consolidating balance sheets of Katy and its Subsidiaries (including the
accounts of all Subsidiaries of Katy and their respective Subsidiaries for the
respective periods during which a Subsidiary relationship existed) as of
September 30, 2002, and the related statements of income and cash flows for the
periods ended on such dates, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and
present fairly in all material respects the financial positions of Katy and such
Persons, taken as a whole, at such dates and the results of Katy's and such
Persons' operations, taken as a whole, for such periods. As of the date hereof,
since September 30, 2002, there has been no material adverse change in the
financial position of Katy and such other Persons, taken as a whole, as
reflected in the Consolidated balance sheet as of such date. As of the date
hereof, the fiscal year of Katy and each of its Subsidiaries ends on December 31
of each year.


                                       48
<PAGE>

            6.1.11 Full Disclosure. The financial statements referred to in
subsection 6.1.10 hereof do not, nor does this Agreement or any other written
statement of any Borrower or any other Loan Party to Agent or any Lender contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit a material fact necessary to
make the statements contained therein or herein not misleading. There is no fact
which any Borrower has failed to disclose to Agent or any Lender in writing
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided
that Agent and Lenders acknowledge that Katy's annual financial statements for
the fiscal years ending December 31, 2000 and 2001 may be subject to re-audit.
Any such re-audit, however, shall not result in or evidence any Material Adverse
Effect.

            6.1.12 Solvent Financial Condition. Each Borrower and each (other
Loan Party (other than Savannah Energy Systems Company and WJ Smith Wood
Preserving Company), neither of which has any material operations), is now and,
after giving effect to the initial Loans to be made and the initial Letters of
Credit and LC Guaranties to be issued hereunder and all related transactions,
will be, Solvent.

            6.1.13 Surety Obligations. Except as set forth on Exhibit 6.1.13, as
of the date hereof, neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
obligated as surety or indemnitor under any surety or similar bond or other
contract or has issued or entered into any agreement to assure payment,
performance or completion of performance of any undertaking or obligation of any
Person.

            6.1.14 Taxes. Katy's federal tax identification number is
75-1277589. The federal tax identification number or Canadian or United Kingdom
equivalent thereof, of each Subsidiary of Katy is shown on Exhibit 6.1.14
hereto. Each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all federal,
provincial, state and local tax returns and other reports relating to taxes
(including goods and services and value added taxes) it is required by law to
file or obtained appropriate extensions for such filings, and has paid, or made
provision for the payment of, all taxes, assessments, fees, levies and other
governmental charges upon it, its income and Properties prior to the time when
such taxes, assessments, fees, levies and charges become delinquent, unless and
to the extent any thereof are being actively contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings and except where the failure to make any such filing of
to pay any such tax could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries maintains reasonable
reserves on its books therefor. The provision for unpaid taxes on the books of
each Borrower and its Subsidiaries is adequate for all years not closed by
applicable statutes, and for the current fiscal year.

            6.1.15 Brokers. Except as shown on Exhibit 6.1.15 hereto, there are
no claims for brokerage commissions, finder's fees or investment banking fees in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            6.1.16 Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses. Each Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries owns, possesses or licenses or has the right to use
all the patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses
and other Intellectual Property necessary for the present and planned future
conduct of its business without any known conflict with the rights of others,
except for such conflicts as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. All such patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names,
copyrights, licenses and other


                                       49
<PAGE>

similar rights are listed on Exhibit 6.1.16 hereto, which shall be updated
annually by Borrowers or more frequently as requested by Agent, if an Event of
Default exists and is continuing. No claim has been asserted to any Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries which is currently pending that their use of their
Intellectual Property or the conduct of their business does or may infringe upon
the Intellectual Property rights of any third party. To the knowledge of
Borrowers and except as set forth on Exhibit 6.1.16 hereto, as of the date
hereof, no Person is engaging in any activity that infringes in any material
respect upon Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' material Intellectual
Property. Except as set forth on Exhibit 6.1.16, each Borrower's and each of its
Subsidiaries' (i) material trademarks, service marks and copyrights are
registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or in the U.S. Copyright
Office, as applicable and (ii) material license agreements and similar
arrangements relating to its Inventory (1) permit, and do not restrict, the
assignment by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to Agent, or any other
Person designated by Agent, of all of any Borrower's or such Subsidiary's, as
applicable, rights, title and interest pertaining to such license agreement or
such similar arrangement and (2) would permit the continued use by any Borrower
or such Subsidiary, or Agent or its assignee, of such license agreement or such
similar arrangement and the right to sell Inventory subject to such license
agreement for a period of no less than 6 months after a default or breach of
such agreement or arrangement. The consummation and performance of the
transactions and actions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, including, without limitation, the exercise by Agent of any of its
rights or remedies under Section 9, will not result in the termination or
impairment of any of any Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' ownership or
rights relating to its Intellectual Property, except for such Intellectual
Property rights the loss or impairment of which could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as listed on Exhibit 6.1.16 and except
as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i)
neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of, or default
under, any term of any license or sublicense with respect to any of its
Intellectual Property and (ii) to the knowledge of Borrowers, no other party to
such license or sublicense is in breach thereof or default thereunder, and such
license is valid and enforceable.

            6.1.17 Governmental Consents. Each Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has, and is in good standing with respect to, all governmental
consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, permits, certificates,
inspections and franchises necessary to continue to conduct its business as
heretofore or proposed to be conducted by it and to own or lease and operate its
Properties as now owned or leased by it, except where the failure to possess or
so maintain such rights could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

            6.1.18 Compliance with Laws. Each Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has duly complied, and its Properties, business operations and
leaseholds are in compliance with, the provisions of all federal, state and
local laws, rules and regulations applicable to such Borrower or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, its Properties or the conduct of its business, except
for such non-compliance as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and there have been no citations, notices or orders of
noncompliance issued to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries under any such
law, rule or regulation, except where such noncompliance could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has established and maintains an adequate monitoring system to
insure that it remains in compliance in all material respects with all federal,
state and local rules, laws and


                                       50
<PAGE>

regulations applicable to it. No Inventory has been produced in violation of the
Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. ss.201 et seq.), as amended.

            6.1.19 Restrictions. Neither any Borrower nor any other Loan Party
is a party or subject to any contract or agreement which restricts its right or
ability to incur Indebtedness, other than as set forth on Exhibit 6.1.19 hereto,
none of which prohibit the execution of or compliance with this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

            6.1.20 Litigation. Except as set forth on Exhibit 6.1.20 hereto,
there are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending, or to the
knowledge of any Borrower, threatened, against or affecting any Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries, or the business, operations, Properties, prospects, profits
or condition of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which, singly or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default with respect to
any order, writ, injunction, judgment, decree or rule of any court, governmental
authority or arbitration board or tribunal, which, singly or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            6.1.21 No Defaults. No event has occurred and no condition exists
which would, upon or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any
Borrower's performance hereunder, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.
Neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in (and no event
has occurred and no condition exists which constitutes, or which the passage of
time or the giving of notice or both would constitute, a default in) the payment
of any Indebtedness to any Person for Money Borrowed in excess of $1,000,000.

            6.1.22 Leases. Exhibit 6.1.22 hereto is a complete listing of all
capitalized and operating personal property leases of each Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and all real property leases of each Borrower and its Subsidiaries
with future non-cancelable payments of $25,000 or more. Each Borrower and each
of its Subsidiaries is in full compliance with all of the terms of each of its
respective capitalized and operating leases, except where the failure to so
comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            6.1.23 Pension Plans.

                  (a) Except as disclosed on Exhibit 6.1.23 hereto, neither U.S.
      Borrower nor any of its ERISA Affiliates maintains or contributes to any
      Plan. U.S. Borrower and each of its ERISA Affiliates have operated in
      compliance with the requirements of ERISA and the regulations promulgated
      thereunder with respect to each Plan, except where the failure to so
      comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
      To the best of Borrowers' knowledge, no fact or situation that could
      reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect exists in
      connection with any Plan. Neither U.S. Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliates
      has incurred any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA in
      connection with a Multiemployer Plan which remains unsatisfied or which
      would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


                                       51

                  (b) The Canadian Pension Plans are duly registered under and
      have been administered in compliance with the ITA and all other applicable
      laws which require registration except where the failure to so comply
      could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All
      obligations of Canadian Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (including
      fiduciary, funding, investment and administration obligations) required to
      be performed in connection with the Canadian Pension Plans and the funding
      agreements therefor have been performed in a timely fashion, except where
      the failure to so perform could not reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding disputes, actions, suits
      or claims concerning the assets of the Canadian Pension Plans other than
      claims for benefits in the ordinary course that could reasonably be
      expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Canadian Borrower
      nor its Subsidiaries is required to make any contributions to the Canadian
      Pension Plans which contributions, in the aggregate, could reasonably be
      expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Canadian Borrower and its
      Subsidiaries have withheld all employee withholdings and have made all
      employer contributions to be withheld and made by it pursuant to federal
      and any provincial applicable law on account of Canadian Pension Plans,
      Canadian Benefit Plans, Canadian employment insurance and employee income
      taxes. To the best of Borrowers' knowledge, no condition exists or
      transaction has occurred in connection with any Canadian Pension Plan or
      Canadian Benefit Plan which could result in the incurrence by Canadian
      Borrower or its Subsidiaries of any liability, fine or penalty that could
      reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) All pension schemes of U.K. Borrower and any Subsidiaries
      of any Borrower that are organized under the laws of the United Kingdom
      are operated in substantial compliance with applicable law and fully
      funded to the extent required by law based on reasonable actuarial
      assumptions applicable in the United Kingdom.

            6.1.24 Trade Relations. There exists no actual or, to any Borrower's
knowledge, threatened termination, cancellation or limitation of, or any
modification or change in, the business relationship between any Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries and any customer or any group of customers whose purchases
individually or in the aggregate are material to the business of Borrowers and
their Subsidiaries, or with any material supplier, except in each case, where
the same could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and
there exists no present condition or state of facts or circumstances which would
prevent any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries from conducting such business
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
substantially the same manner in which it has heretofore been conducted.

            6.1.25 Labor Relations. Except as described on Exhibit 6.1.25
hereto, as of the date hereof, neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any collective bargaining agreement. There are no material
grievances, disputes or controversies with any union or any other organization
of any Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' employees, or threats of strikes,
work stoppages or any asserted pending demands for collective bargaining by any
union or organization, except those that could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

            6.1.26 Borrowers and Each Other Loan Party. As of the Closing Date,
Borrowers and the other Loan Parties are engaged in the businesses of
manufacturing and distributing industrial and consumer products, including,
without limitation, sanitary maintenance supplies, coated abrasives, stains,
electrical and electronic components, as well as in certain other businesses.
These operations require financing on a basis such that the credit supplied can
be made available from time to time to Borrowers and the other Loan Parties, as
required for the continued successful operation of Borrowers and the other Loan
Parties taken as a whole. Borrowers and the other Loan Parties have requested
the Lenders to make credit available hereunder primarily for the purposes of
Section 1.1.3 and generally for the purposes of financing the operations of
Borrowers and the other Loan Parties. Borrowers and other Loan Party expect to
derive benefit (and the Board of Directors of each Borrower and each other Loan
Party has determined that each Borrower or such other Loan Party may reasonably
be expected to derive benefit), directly or indirectly, from a portion of the
credit extended by Lenders hereunder, both in its separate capacity and as a
member of the group of companies, since the successful operation and condition
of Borrowers and each other Loan Party is dependent on the continued successful
performance of the functions of the group as a whole. Borrowers acknowledge
that, but for the agreement of each of each Borrower and the other Loan Parties
to execute and deliver this Agreement and/or the Loan Documents, Agent and
Lenders would not have made available the credit facilities established hereby
on the terms set forth herein.

      6.2 Continuous Nature of Representations and Warranties. Each
representation and warranty contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be continuous in nature and shall remain accurate, complete and
not misleading at all times during the term of this Agreement, except for
changes in the nature of any Borrower's or one of Borrower's Subsidiary's
business or operations that would render the information in any exhibit attached
hereto or to any other Loan Document either inaccurate, incomplete or
misleading, so long as Majority Lenders have consented to such changes or such
changes are expressly permitted by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Loan request made or deemed made pursuant to
subsection 3.1.1 hereof shall constitute Borrowers' reaffirmation, as of the
date of each such loan request, of each representation, warranty or other
statement made or furnished to Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of Borrowers,
any Subsidiary of any Borrower or any other Loan Party in this Agreement, any of
the other Loan Documents, or any instrument, certificate or financial statement
furnished in compliance with or in reference thereto.

      6.3 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties of Borrowers contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance thereof by Agent
and each Lender and the parties thereto and the closing of the transactions
described therein or related thereto.

                 SECTION 7. COVENANTS AND CONTINUING AGREEMENTS

      7.1 Affirmative Covenants. During the Term, and thereafter for so long as
there are any Obligations outstanding, Borrowers covenant that, unless otherwise
consented to by Majority Lenders, in writing, they shall:

            7.1.1 Visits and Inspections; Lender Meeting. Permit (i)
representatives of Agent, and during the continuation of any Default or Event of
Default any Lender, from time to


                                       53
<PAGE>

time, as often as may be reasonably requested, but only during normal business
hours, to visit and inspect the Properties of Borrowers and each of their
Subsidiaries, inspect, audit and make extracts from their books and records, and
discuss with their officers, their employees and their independent accountants,
each Borrower's and each of its Subsidiaries' business, assets, liabilities,
financial condition, business prospects and results of operations and (ii)
appraisers engaged pursuant to Section 2.10 (whether or not personnel of Agent),
but only during normal business hours, to visit and inspect the Properties of
each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries, for the purpose of completing
appraisals pursuant to Section 2.10. Agent, if no Default or Event of Default
then exists, shall give Borrower Representative reasonable prior notice of any
such inspection or audit. Without limiting the foregoing, on the request of
Agent, Borrowers will participate and will cause its key management personnel to
participate in a meeting with Agent and Lenders once during each year (except
that during the continuation of an Event of Default such meetings may be held
more frequently as requested by Agent or Majority Lenders), which meeting(s)
shall be held at such times and such places as may be reasonably requested by
Agent.

            7.1.2 Notices. Promptly notify Agent in writing, upon obtaining
knowledge, of the occurrence of any event or the existence of any fact which
renders any representation or warranty in this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents inaccurate, incomplete or misleading in any material respect as
of the date made or remade. In addition, except as otherwise set forth herein,
(x) Borrowers agree to provide Agent with prompt written notice, upon obtaining
knowledge, of any change in the information disclosed in any Exhibit hereto
which could reasonably be expected to have or to evidence a Material Adverse
Effect and (y) on a semi-annual basis, Borrowers agree to provide Agent with
updated versions of the factual Exhibits hereto, in each case after giving
effect to the materiality limits and Material Adverse Effect qualifications
contained therein.

            7.1.3 Financial Statements. Keep, and cause each of their
Subsidiaries to keep, adequate records and books of account with respect to
their or its business activities in which proper entries are made in accordance
with customary accounting practices reflecting all their or its financial
transactions; and cause to be prepared and furnished to Agent and each Lender,
the following, all to be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a

            such year, on a Consolidated basis, certified by a firm of
            independent certified public accountants of recognized standing

            time thereafter a copy of any management letter issued in connection
            therewith;

            interim financial statements of Katy and its Subsidiaries as of the

            Projections for the current fiscal year delivered pursuant to
            subsection 7.1.7. The information above shall be presented in
            reasonable detail and shall be certified by the chief financial

            which may be substituted therefor or any national securities
            exchange;

                  (v) upon request of Agent, copies of any annual report to be

            as Agent or any Lender (through Agent), from time to time, may
            reasonably request, bearing upon or related to the Collateral or any
            Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' financial condition or
            results of operations.

            Concurrently with the delivery of the financial statements described

Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Agent Borrowing Base Certificates more
frequently than monthly.

lessee of any premises at which any Collateral may, from time to time, be kept.
With respect to any lease (other than leases for sales offices), warehousing
agreement or any processing agreement in any case entered into after the Closing
Date, the applicable Borrower shall provide Agent with appropriate Collateral

<PAGE>

automatically be terminated and all of the Obligations shall become
automatically due and payable, in each case without declaration, notice or

      9.3 Other Remedies.

      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Agent shall have and may exercise from time to time the following other rights
and remedies:

      9.3.1 All of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC,
PPSA and the laws of the United Kingdom or under other applicable law, and all
other legal and equitable rights to which Agent or Lenders may be entitled, all
of which rights and remedies shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any
other rights or remedies contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, and none of which shall be exclusive.

            9.3.2 The right to take immediate possession of the Collateral, and
to (i) require Borrowers and each other Loan Party to assemble the Collateral,
at Borrowers' expense, and make it available to Agents at a place designated by
Agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties, and (ii) enter any
premises where any of the Collateral shall be located and to keep and store the
Collateral on said premises until sold (and if said premises be the Property of
a Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower, such Borrower agrees not to
charge, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to charge, Agents for storage
thereof).

            9.3.3 The right to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any
Collateral in its then condition, or after any further manufacturing or
processing thereof, at public or private sale or sales, with such notice as may
be required by law, in lots or in bulk, for cash or on credit, all as Agents, in
their sole discretion, may deem advisable. Agents may, at their option, disclaim
any and all warranties regarding the Collateral in connection with any such
sale. Each Borrower agrees that 10 days' written notice to such Borrower or any
other Loan Party of any public or private sale or other disposition of
Collateral shall be reasonable notice thereof, and such sale shall be at such
locations as Agents may designate in said notice. Agents shall have the right to
conduct such sales on any Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' or any other
Loan Party's premises, without charge therefor, and such sales may be adjourned
from time to time in accordance with applicable law. Agents shall have the right
to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the Collateral, or any part thereof, for
cash, credit or any combination thereof, and Agents, on behalf of Lenders, may
purchase all or any part of the Collateral at public or, if permitted by law,
private sale and, in lieu of actual payment of such purchase price, may set off
the amount of such price against the Obligations. The proceeds realized from the
sale of any Collateral may be applied, after allowing 2 Business Days for
collection, first to the costs, expenses and attorneys' fees incurred by Agents
in collecting the Obligations, in enforcing the rights of Agents and Lenders
under the Loan Documents and in collecting, retaking, completing, protecting,
removing, storing, advertising for sale, selling and delivering any Collateral,
second to the interest due upon any of the Obligations; and third, to the
principal of the Obligations. Subject to Section 1.3 of this Agreement, if any
deficiency shall arise, Borrowers and each Loan Party shall remain jointly and
severally liable to Agents and Lenders therefor.

            9.3.4 Agent, with respect to the U.S. Collateral, Canadian Agent,
with respect to the Canadian Collateral, and U.K. Agent, with respect to the
U.K. Collateral, is hereby granted


                                       70
<PAGE>

a non-exclusive license or other right to use, without charge, each Borrower's
licenses for Computer Software or any Property of a similar nature, as it
pertains to the Collateral, in realizing upon any Collateral and each Borrower's
rights under all such licenses shall inure to Agent's, Canadian Agent's and U.K.
Agent's benefit; provided that any such license or right to use shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of the underlying license.

            9.3.5 Agents, at their option, may require each applicable Borrower
to deposit with Agent, funds equal to the U.S. LC Amount, with Canadian Agent,
funds equal to the Canadian LC Amount and with U.K. Agent, the U.K. LC Amount,
and, if such Borrower fails to promptly make such deposit, Agent, Canadian Agent
and U.K. Agent, as the case may be, may advance such amount as a Revolving
Credit Loan (whether or not an Overadvance is created thereby). Each such
Revolving Credit Loan shall be secured by all of the Collateral (except that
U.K. Collateral and Canadian Collateral shall not secure Revolving Credit Loans
to U.S. Borrower) and shall constitute a Base Rate Revolving Portion. Any such
deposit or advance shall be held by Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as
applicable, as a reserve to fund future payments on such applicable LC
Guaranties and future drawings against such applicable Letters of Credit. At
such time as all LC Guaranties have been paid or terminated and all Letters of
Credit have been drawn upon or expired, any amounts remaining in such reserve
shall be applied against any outstanding Obligations, or, if all Obligations
have been indefeasibly paid in full, returned to the applicable Borrower;
provided, that in no event shall any such reserves held as Canadian Collateral
or U.K. Collateral be applied to the U.S. Obligations.

      9.4 Set Off and Sharing of Payments. In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby
authorized by Borrowers at any time or from time to time, with prior written
consent of Agents, and with reasonably prompt subsequent notice to Borrower
Representative (any prior or contemporaneous notice to Borrower Representative
being hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any
and all (i) balances held by such Lender at any of its offices for the account
of any Borrower (regardless of whether such balances are then due to any such
Borrower); and (ii) other property at any time held or owing by such Lender to
or for the credit or for the account of any Borrower against and on account of
any of the Obligations. Any Lender exercising a right to set off shall, to the
extent the amount of any such set off exceeds its Aggregate Percentage of the
amount set off, purchase for cash (and the other Lenders shall sell) interests
in each such other Lender's pro rata share of the Obligations as would be
necessary to cause such Lender to share such excess with each other Lender in
accordance with their respective Aggregate Percentages. Borrowers agree, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender may exercise its right to set
off with respect to amounts in excess of its pro rata share of the Obligations
and upon doing so shall deliver such excess to Agent for the benefit of all
Lenders in accordance with the Aggregate Percentages. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Lender shall exercise set off rights with respect to U.K.
Borrower's or Canadian Borrowers' assets and apply such proceeds to the U.S.
Obligations.

      9.5 Remedies Cumulative; No Waiver. All covenants, conditions, provisions,
warranties, guaranties, indemnities, and other undertakings of Borrowers
contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in any document
referred to herein or contained in any agreement supplementary hereto or in any
schedule given to Agents or any Lender or


                                       71
<PAGE>

contained in any other agreement between any Lender and any Borrower or between
Agents and any Borrower heretofore, concurrently, or hereafter entered into,
shall be deemed cumulative to and not in derogation or substitution of any of
the terms, covenants, conditions, or agreements of any Borrower herein
contained. The failure or delay of Agents or any Lender to require strict
performance by Borrowers of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise or
enforce any rights, Liens, powers, or remedies hereunder or under any of the
aforesaid agreements or other documents or security or Collateral shall not
operate as a waiver of such performance, Liens, rights, powers and remedies, but
all such requirements, Liens, rights, powers, and remedies shall continue in
full force and effect until all Loans and other Obligations owing or to become
owing from Borrowers to Agents and each Lender have been fully satisfied. None
of the undertakings, agreements, warranties, covenants and representations of
Borrowers contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and no
Default or Event of Default by Borrowers under this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to have been suspended or waived by Lenders, unless
such suspension or waiver is by an instrument in writing specifying such
suspension or waiver and is signed by a duly authorized representative of Agents
and directed to Borrowers.

                   SECTION 10. AGENT; ASSIGNMENTS; AMENDMENTS

      10.1 Authorization and Action.

                  (a) Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes Agent to take
      such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
      and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof
      and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
      thereto. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes Canadian Agent to take
      such action on its behalf (and on behalf of Agent) and to exercise such
      powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to
      the administration of all Loans made to Canadian Borrower and with respect
      to Canadian Collateral. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes U.K.
      Agent to take such action on its behalf (and on behalf of Agent) and to
      exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
      with respect to the administration of all Loans made to U.K. Borrower and
      with respect to U.K. Collateral. Each Lender hereby acknowledges that
      Agents shall not have by reason of this Agreement assumed a fiduciary
      relationship in respect of any Lender. In performing its functions and
      duties under this Agreement, Agents shall act solely as agent of Lenders
      and shall not assume, or be deemed to have assumed, any obligation toward,
      or relationship of agency or trust with or for, any Borrower. As to any
      matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement and the other Loan
      Documents (including without limitation enforcement and collection of the
      Notes), Agents may, but shall not be required to, exercise any discretion
      or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting
      (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon
      the instructions of the Majority Lenders, whenever such instruction shall
      be requested by Agents or required hereunder, or a greater or lesser
      number of Lenders if so required hereunder, and such instructions shall be
      binding upon all Lenders; provided, that Agents shall be fully justified
      in failing or refusing to take any action which exposes Agents to any
      liability (other than taxes payable in the ordinary course of business) or
      which is contrary to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or
      applicable law, unless Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable,
      is


                                       72
<PAGE>

      indemnified to its satisfaction by the other Lenders against any and all
      liability and expense (other than any taxes that are not Tax Liabilities)
      which it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
      action. If Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent seeks the consent or
      approval of the Majority Lenders (or a greater or lesser number of Lenders
      as required in this Agreement), with respect to any action hereunder,
      Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, shall send notice
      thereof to each Lender and shall notify each Lender at any time that the
      Majority Lenders (or such greater or lesser number of Lenders) have
      instructed Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as applicable, to act or
      refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

                  (b) Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to delegate to
      Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent any and all of its obligations under this
      Agreement and the Loan Documents with respect to all actions required to
      be taken in Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively, of any kind
      whatsoever. Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent, when acting pursuant to the
      authority granted hereunder, shall have all the protections, indemnities,
      rights and powers granted to Agent under this Agreement and any Loan
      Document.

                  (c) To the extent necessary, each Canadian Lender appoints the
      Canadian Agent as its agent to hold in the name of the Canadian Agent, for
      the benefit of each Canadian Lender, any of the debentures issued by
      Canadian Borrower and outstanding from time to time forming part of the
      Security Documents, and appoints CIBC Mellon Trust Company as the person
      holding the power of attorney for the holders of bonds or other titles of
      indebtedness for all purposes of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec.
      Each Borrower, to the extent necessary, hereby consents to all present and
      future appointments made in this Section 10.1(c) or pursuant thereto.

      10.2 Agent's Reliance, Etc. None of Agents or their Affiliates, nor any of
their respective directors, officers, agents or employees, shall be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection
with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for its or their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of
the foregoing, Agents: (i) may treat each Lender party hereto as the holder of

initially or on an ongoing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other
similar information regarding Borrowers.

authorized on behalf of all Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or
further consent from any Lender to take any action with respect to any
Collateral or the Loan Documents which may be necessary to perfect and maintain
perfected Agents' Liens upon the Collateral, for their benefit and the ratable
benefit of Lenders. Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agents at their option
and in their discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by Agents upon

was granted or at any time thereafter; or (iv) in connection with any
foreclosure sale or other disposition of Collateral after the occurrence and

perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or

interest in the Collateral as Lenders and that Agents shall have no duty or
liability whatsoever to any Lender.

this Section 10.9, any interest in this Agreement or any Loans is transferred to
any transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United States or any state thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
transferee (including any Participant) concurrently with and as a condition
precedent to the effectiveness of such transfer, to (i) represent to the
transferor Lender (for the benefit of the transferor Lender, Agent and

be withheld by Agent, Borrowers or the transferor Lender with respect to any
payments to be made to such transferee in respect of the interest so
transferred, (ii) furnish to the transferor Lender, Agent and Borrower

transferee or such Participant shall not be entitled to any payment on account
of or indemnification for any Tax Liabilities. The foregoing notwithstanding,
unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no Lender shall be

make conforming changes to the signature pages hereof and any Assignment and
Assumption Agreement to reflect such adjustments. If a fee is to be paid by
Borrowers in connection with any waiver or amendment hereunder, the agreement
evidencing such amendment or waiver may, at the discretion of Agent (but shall
not be required to), provide that only Lenders executing such agreement by a
specified date may share in such fee (and in such case, such fee shall be
divided


                                       78

Agent or U.K. Agent shall resign under this Agreement, then, (i) subject to the

from among Lenders (located in the relevant jurisdiction) successor agents or
agent, as applicable, for Lenders or (ii) if successor agents or agent, as
applicable, shall not be so appointed and approved within the thirty (30) day

subject to Borrowers' consent, if applicable, as set forth above. Subject to the
consent of Borrowers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and which
consent shall not be required during any period in which a Default or an Event
of Default exists), in the case of Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent only, Agent

relevant jurisdiction a successor agent or agents, as applicable. Upon its
appointment, such successor agents or agent shall succeed to the rights, powers
and duties of Agents and the term "Agent", "Canadian Agent", "U.K. Agent" and

appointment, and the former Agents' rights, powers and duties as Agents shall,
as applicable, be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the
part of such former Agents or any of the parties to this Agreement. After the
resignation of such Agents hereunder, the provisions of this Section 10 shall
inure to the benefit of such former Agents and such former Agents shall not by
reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability for any
actions taken or not taken by it while acting as Agents under this Agreement.

Borrowers, an Affiliate of Fleet Capital Canada Corporation or Fleet Capital
Corporation may be appointed by Fleet Capital Canada Corporation to replace

such replacement Canadian Agent shall provide prior notice to Borrowers of such
replacement.

                               FINANCIAL COVENANTS

DEFINITIONS

            Consolidated EBITDA - for any period, the sum, without duplication,
of the amounts for such period of (i) Consolidated Net Income, (ii) Consolidated
Interest Expense, (iii) provisions for taxes based on income, (iv) total
depreciation expense, (v) total amortization expense, (vi) all unusual expenses
and all other non-capitalized restructuring expenses (including costs and
expenses attributable to employee severance obligations and facility
consolidation costs) for such period to the extent not disallowed by Agent in
its sole discretion, (vii) any payment of or accrual for the Management Fee
under the Management Agreement, (viii) all other payments made to K&C and its
Affiliates during such period for expenses incurred on behalf of Parent, Katy or
any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to Kohlberg Agreements, (ix) any
non-cash expense incurred with respect to Katy's stock appreciation rights plan
("SAR"); and (x) other non-cash items (other than any such non-cash item to the
extent that it represents an accrual of or reserve for cash expenditures in any
future period), but only, in the case of clauses (ii)-(ix), to the extent
deducted in the calculation of Consolidated Net Income less other non-cash items
added in the calculation of Consolidated Net Income (other than any such
non-cash item to the extent that it will result in the receipt of cash payments
in any future period), all of the foregoing as determined on a consolidated
basis for Katy and its Subsidiaries in conformity with GAAP; provided that there
shall be subtracted from the sum of items (i) through (xi) above the amount of
any cash expenditure made within the applicable period pursuant to the SAR, to
the extent that the amount of such cash expenditure was expensed or will be
expensed against a prior or future period's Consolidated Net Income; provided,
further, that (a) in the event any Loan Party makes an acquisition of any Person
or any division or any business unit permitted hereunder or consented to by
Majority Lenders during such period, if Katy provides Agent and Lenders
financial statements with respect to the business so acquired (which financial
statements shall have been audited by one of the "Big 4" accounting firms or
another nationally recognized accounting firm reasonably satisfactory to Agent
or financial statements otherwise satisfactory to Agent) reasonably satisfactory
to Majority Lenders, Consolidated EBITDA for such period shall be calculated on
a pro forma basis, taking into account the elimination of non-recurring
expenses, based on the results of such acquired Person or acquired assets as if
such acquisition had occurred on the first day of such period, and (b) in the
event any Loan Party makes a Permitted Disposition (or any other disposition of
any Person or any division or any business unit permitted hereunder or consented
to by the Majority Lenders) during such period, Consolidated EBITDA for such
period shall be calculated on a pro forma basis, based on the results of such
disposed Person or disposed assets as if such Permitted Disposition (or such
other disposition) had occurred on the first day of such period. The foregoing
notwithstanding, Consolidated EBITDA for: (i) the fiscal quarter ended June 30,
2002 shall be deemed to equal $6,800,000; (ii) for the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2002 shall be deemed to equal $12,000,000; and (iii) for the
fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2002 shall be deemed to equal $10,800,000.

            Consolidated Interest Expense - for any period, total interest
expense of Katy and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis with respect to all
outstanding Indebtedness of Katy


                              Exhibit 7.3 - Page 1

and its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all commissions, discounts
and other fees and charges owed with respect to letters of credit and bankers'
acceptance financing and net costs under Interest Rate Agreements, but
excluding, however, (i) any amounts referred to in the Fee Letter.

            Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as at any date, the ratio of (a)
Consolidated Total Debt as at such date to (b) Consolidated EBITDA for the
consecutive four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the most recently
ended fiscal quarter.

            Consolidated Net Income, for any period, the net income (or loss) of
Katy on a Consolidated basis for such period taken as a single accounting period
determined in conformity with GAAP; provided that there shall be excluded (i)
the income (or loss) of any Person (other than a Subsidiary of Katy) in which
any other Person (other than Katy or any of its Subsidiaries) has a joint
interest, except to the extent of the amount of dividends or other distributions
actually paid to Katy or any of its Subsidiaries by such Person during such
period, (ii) the income (or loss) of any Person accrued prior to the date it
becomes a Subsidiary of Katy or is merged into or consolidated with Katy or any
of its Subsidiaries or that Person's assets are acquired by Katy or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) the income of any Subsidiary of Katy to the extent that the
declaration or payment of dividends or similar distributions by that Subsidiary
of that income is not at the time permitted by operation of the terms of its
charter or any agreement, instrument, judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or
governmental regulation applicable to that Subsidiary, (iv) any after-tax gains
or losses attributable to Asset Sales or returned surplus assets of any Pension
Plan, (v) any LIFO reserves of Contico to the extent such LIFO reserves decrease
or increase net income of Contico, and (vii) (to the extent not included in
clauses (i) through (v) above) any net extraordinary gains or net extraordinary
losses.

            Consolidated Total Debt means, as at any date of determination, the
aggregate stated balance sheet amount (which shall not include the face amount
of undrawn Letters of Credit) of all Money Borrowed of Katy and its Subsidiaries
on the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter, determined on a
Consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP.

                                   SCHEDULE A

                            Mandatory Costs Formulae

1.    The Mandatory Cost is an addition to the interest rate to compensate
      Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank
      of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case,
      any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the
      requirements of the European Central Bank.

2.    On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible
      thereafter), Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the
      "Additional Costs Rate") for each Lender, in accordance with the
      paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by Agent
      as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Costs Rates (weighted in
      proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant
      Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.

3.    The Additional Costs Rate for any Lender lending from a facility office in
      a Participating Member State (as defined below) will be the percentage
      notified by that Lender to Agent. This percentage will be certified by
      that Lender in its notice to Agent to be its reasonable determination of
      the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender's participation in all
      advances made from that facility office) of complying with the minimum
      reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans made
      from that facility office.

4.    The Additional Costs Rate for any Lender lending from a facility office in
      the United Kingdom will be calculated by Agent as follows:

      (a)   in relation to a Sterling Loan:

                   AB + C(B-D) + E x 0.01 per cent. per annum
                                   100 - (A+C)

      (b)   in relation to a Loan in any currency other than Sterling:

                          E x 0.01 per cent. per annum
                                       300

      where:

      A     is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in
            excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time
            required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the
            Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements;

      B     is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Margin
            and the Mandatory Cost and, if the Loan is an unpaid sum, the
            additional rate of interest specified in subsection 2.1.2 of the
            Agreement, payable for the relevant Interest Period on the Loan;


                               Schedule A - Page 1
<PAGE>

      C     is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender
            is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing
            Special Deposits with the Bank of England;

      D     is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to
            Agent on interest-bearing Special Deposits; and

      E     is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees
            Rules and is calculated by Agent as being the average of the most
            recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to Agent
            pursuant to paragraph 8 below and expressed in pounds per
            (pound)1,000,000.

5.    For the purposes of this Schedule:

      (a)   "Eligible Liabilities" and "Special Deposits" have the meanings
            given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of
            England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;

      (b)   "Fees Rules" means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA
            Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in
            force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the
            acceptance of deposits;

      (c)   "Fee Tariffs" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules
            under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum
            fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking
            into account any applicable discount rate); and

      (d)   "Tariff Base" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated
            in accordance with, the Fees Rules.

6.    In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in
      the formulae as percentages (i.e., 5 per cent. will be included in the
      formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D
      from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded up
      to four decimal places.

7.    If requested by Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable
      after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to Agent,
      the rate of charge payable by that Reference Bank to the Financial
      Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant
      financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this
      purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs
      applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed
      in pounds per (pound)1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.

8.    Each Lender shall supply any information required by Agent for the purpose
      of calculating its Additional Costs Rate. In particular, but without
      limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information in writing
      on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:


                               Schedule A - Page 2
<PAGE>

      (a)   its jurisdiction of incorporation and jurisdiction of its facility
            office; and

      (b)   any other information that Agent may reasonably require for such
            purpose.

      Each Lender shall promptly notify Agent in writing of any change to the
      information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.

9.    The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above, and the
      rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be
      determined by Agent, based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to
      paragraphs 7 and 8 above, and on the assumption that, unless a Lender
      notifies Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to
      cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a
      typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a facility office
      in the same jurisdiction as its facility office.

10.   Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results
      in an Additional Costs Rate which over- or under-compensates any Lender
      and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any
      Lender or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true
      and correct in all respects.

11.   Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the
      Mandatory Costs to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional Costs Rate
      for each Lender, based on the information provided by each Lender and each
      Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.

12.   Any determination by Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a
      formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Costs Rate or any amount
      payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive
      and binding on all parties to this Agreement.

13.   Agent may from time to time, after consultation (but without their
      consent) with the Borrower Representative and the Lenders, determine and
      notify to all parties to this Agreement any amendments that are required
      to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law,
      regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of
      England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank
      (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its
      functions). Any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest
      error, be conclusive and binding on all such parties.

14.   For the purposes of this Schedule "Participating Member State" means any
      member state of the European Communities that adopts or has adopted the
      Euro as its lawful currency in accordance with legislation of the European
      Community relating to Economic and Monetary Union.
