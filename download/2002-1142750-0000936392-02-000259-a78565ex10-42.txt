respect thereto or (b) the Agent or the Requisite Lenders shall so object in
writing within 60 days after delivery of such financial statements, then such
calculations shall be made on a basis consistent with the most recent financial
statements delivered by the Credit Parties to the Lenders as to which no such
objection shall have been made.

                                    SECTION 2

                                 CREDIT FACILITY

      2.1   REVOLVING LOANS.

            (a)   Revolving Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions
      hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth
      herein, each Lender severally agrees to make available to the Borrower
      such Lender's Commitment Percentage of revolving credit loans requested by
      the Borrower in Dollars ("Revolving Loans") from time to time from the
      Closing Date until the Maturity Date, or such earlier date as the
      Revolving Commitments shall have been terminated as provided herein;
      provided, however, that the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal
      amount of Revolving Loans shall not exceed FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
      ($50,000,000) (as such aggregate maximum amount may be reduced from time
      to time as provided in Section 3.4, the "Revolving Committed Amount");
      provided, further, (A) with regard to each Lender individually, such
      Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans shall not exceed such Lender's
      Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount, and (B) the sum
      of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC
      Obligations plus Swingline Loans shall not exceed the Revolving Committed
      Amount. Revolving Loans may consist of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar
      Loans, or a combination thereof, as the Borrower may request; provided,


                                       28
<PAGE>
      however, that no more than 6 Eurodollar Loans which are Revolving Loans
      shall be outstanding hereunder at any time (it being understood that, for
      purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods shall be
      considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on the same
      date, although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in accordance
      with the provisions hereof, be combined at the end of existing Interest
      Periods to constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest
      Period). Revolving Loans hereunder may be repaid and reborrowed in
      accordance with the provisions hereof.

            (b)   Revolving Loan Borrowings.

                  (i)   Notice of Borrowing.

                        (A)   The Borrower shall submit an appropriate Notice of
                  Borrowing to the Agent with respect to the initial borrowing
                  of Revolving Loans on the Closing Date no later than 12:00
                  Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Closing Date.
                  Such Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall
                  specify the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loan
                  to be borrowed. The full amount of the Revolving Loan
                  disbursed on the Closing Date shall be a Base Rate Loan.

                        (B)   With respect to each borrowing of Revolving Loans
                  disbursed after the Closing Date, the Borrower shall request
                  such Revolving Loan borrowing by written notice (or telephonic
                  notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Agent not later
                  than 12:30 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date
                  of the requested borrowing in the case of Base Rate Loans, and
                  on the third Business Day prior to the date of the requested
                  borrowing in the case of Eurodollar Loans. Each such request
                  for borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A) that
                  a Revolving Loan is requested, (B) the date of the requested
                  borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the aggregate
                  principal amount to be borrowed, and (D) whether the borrowing
                  shall be comprised of Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar Loans or a
                  combination thereof, and if Eurodollar Loans are requested,
                  the Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail to
                  specify in any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an applicable
                  Interest Period in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, then such
                  notice shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period
                  of one month, or (II) the type of Revolving Loan requested,
                  then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for a Base
                  Rate Loan hereunder. The Agent shall give notice to each
                  affected Lender promptly upon receipt of each Notice of
                  Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i), the contents
                  thereof and each such Lender's share of any borrowing to be
                  made pursuant thereto.

                  (ii)  Minimum Amounts. Each Eurodollar Loan or Base Rate Loan
            that is a Revolving Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate principal
            amount of $2,000,000 and integral multiples of $250,000 in excess
            thereof (or the remaining amount of the Revolving Committed Amount,
            if less).


                                       29
<PAGE>
                  (iii) Advances. Each Lender will make its Commitment
            Percentage of each Revolving Loan borrowing available to the Agent
            for the account of the Borrower as specified in Section 3.15(a), or
            in such other manner as the Agent may specify in writing, by 2:00
            P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date specified in the
            applicable Notice of Borrowing in Dollars and in funds immediately
            available to the Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available
            to the Borrower by the Agent by crediting the account of the
            Borrower on the books of such office with the aggregate of the
            amounts made available to the Agent by the Lenders and in like funds
            as received by the Agent; provided, however, that the Agent shall,
            if requested by the Borrower, make the initial advance of Revolving
            Loans on the Closing Date available to Borrower as provided above
            prior to the Agent's receipt of corresponding amounts from the
            Lenders.

            (c)   Repayment. The principal amount of all Revolving Loans shall
      be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date, unless accelerated sooner
      pursuant to Section 9.2.

            (d)   Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1,

                  (i)   Base Rate Loans. During such periods as Revolving Loans
            shall be comprised in whole or in part of Base Rate Loans, such Base
            Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
            Adjusted Base Rate.

                  (ii)  Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as Revolving Loans
            shall be comprised in whole or in part of Eurodollar Loans, such
            Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to
            the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.

      Interest on Revolving Loans shall be payable in arrears on each applicable
      Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be specified herein).

            (e)   Revolving Notes. The Revolving Loans made by each Lender shall
      be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note of the Borrower to such
      Lender in an original principal amount equal to such Lender's Commitment
      Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount and in substantially the form
      of Exhibit 2.1(e).

      2.2   LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

            (a)   Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in
      reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, the
      applicable Issuing Lender agrees to issue, and each Lender severally
      agrees to participate in the issuance by each Issuing Lender of, standby
      and trade Letters of Credit in Dollars from time to time from the Closing
      Date until the date thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date as the
      Borrower may request, in a form acceptable to the applicable Issuing
      Lender; provided, however, that (i) the LOC Obligations outstanding shall
      not at any time exceed TEN MILLION DOLLARS ($10,000,000) (the "LOC
      Committed Amount") and (ii) the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal
      amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations plus Swingline Loans shall
      not at any time exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. No Letter of Credit


                                       30
<PAGE>
      shall (x) have an original expiry date more than one year from the date of
      issuance (provided that any such Letter of Credit may contain customary
      "evergreen" provisions pursuant to which the expiry date is automatically
      extended by a specific time period unless the applicable Issuing Lender
      gives notice to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit at least a
      specified time period prior to the expiry date then in effect) or (y) as
      originally issued or as extended, have an expiry date extending beyond the
      date thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date. Each Letter of Credit
      shall comply with the related LOC Documents. The issuance and expiry dates
      of each Letter of Credit shall be a Business Day.

            (b)   Notice and Reports. The request for the issuance of a Letter
      of Credit shall be submitted by the Borrower to the applicable Issuing
      Lender at least three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of
      issuance. At least quarterly (and more frequently upon request), each
      Issuing Lender shall provide to the Agent a detailed report specifying the
      Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender which are then issued and
      outstanding and any activity with respect thereto which may have occurred
      since the date of the prior report, and including therein, among other
      things, the beneficiary, the face amount and the expiry date, as well as
      any payment or expirations which may have occurred. The Agent shall
      disseminate promptly to each of the Lenders the information provided by
      the Issuing Lender(s) pursuant to this subsection (b).

            (c)   Participation. Each Lender, upon issuance of a Letter of
      Credit, shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a Participation
      Interest from the applicable Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit and
      the obligations arising thereunder and any collateral relating thereto, in
      each case in an amount equal to its pro rata share of the obligations
      under such Letter of Credit (based on the respective Commitment
      Percentages of the Lenders) and shall absolutely, unconditionally and
      irrevocably assume and be obligated to pay to the applicable Issuing
      Lender and discharge when due, its pro rata share of the obligations
      arising under such Letter of Credit. Without limiting the scope and nature
      of each Lender's Participation Interest in any Letter of Credit, to the
      extent that the applicable Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed as
      required hereunder or under any such Letter of Credit, each such Lender
      shall pay to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender
      its pro rata share of such unreimbursed drawing in same day funds on the
      day of notification by the Agent of an unreimbursed drawing pursuant to
      the provisions of subsection (d) below. The obligation of each Lender to
      so reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender shall be absolute and
      unconditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of a Default, an
      Event of Default or any other occurrence or event. Any such reimbursement
      shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to
      reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit,
      together with interest as hereinafter provided.

            (d)   Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any Letter of
      Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower
      and the Agent. Unless the Borrower shall promptly notify the Agent and the
      applicable Issuing Lender that the Borrower intends to otherwise reimburse
      the applicable Issuing Lender for such drawing, the Borrower shall be
      deemed to have requested that the Lenders make a Revolving Loan in the
      amount of such drawing as provided in subsection (e) below, the proceeds
      of which will


                                       31
<PAGE>
      be used to satisfy the related reimbursement obligations. The Borrower
      promises to reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender (such reimbursement to
      made to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender) for
      each drawing under any Letter of Credit (either with the proceeds of a
      Revolving Loan obtained hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds (i) if
      it shall receive notice of such drawing from the applicable Issuing Lender
      prior to 1:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on any Business Day,
      on such Business Day and (ii) if it shall receive such notice after 1:00
      P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on any day, on the next Business Day
      after it shall receive such notice. The unreimbursed amount of any drawing
      shall bear interest from the date of such drawing through the date upon
      which reimbursement thereof is required as provided above at the Federal
      Funds Rate. If the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the applicable Issuing
      Lender as provided hereinabove, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing
      shall thereafter bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted
      Base Rate plus 2%. The Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder
      shall be absolute and unconditional under all circumstances irrespective
      of any rights of setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment the Borrower
      may claim or have against the applicable Issuing Lender, the Agent, the
      Lenders, the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other
      Person, including without limitation any defense based on any failure of
      the Borrower or any other Credit Party to receive consideration or the
      legality, validity, regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of
      Credit. The applicable Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Agent, who
      shall, in turn, promptly notify the other Lenders of the amount of any
      unreimbursed drawing and each Lender shall promptly pay to the Agent for
      the account of the applicable Issuing Lender in Dollars and in immediately
      available funds, the amount of such Lender's pro rata share of such
      unreimbursed drawing. Such payment shall be made on the day such notice is
      received by such Lender from the Agent if such notice is received at or
      before 3:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time), and otherwise such
      payment shall be made at or before 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina
      time) on the Business Day next succeeding the day such notice is received.
      If such Lender does not pay such amount to the Agent for the account of
      the applicable Issuing Lender in full upon such request, such Lender
      shall, on demand, pay to the Agent for the account of the applicable
      Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the period from the
      date of such drawing until such Lender pays such amount to the Agent for
      the account of the applicable Issuing Lender in full at a rate per annum
      equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of the date that such
      Lender is required to make payments of such amount pursuant to the
      preceding sentence, the Federal Funds Rate and thereafter at a rate equal
      to the Base Rate. Each Lender's obligation to make such payment to the
      applicable Issuing Lender, and the right of the applicable Issuing Lender
      to receive the same, shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not be
      affected by any circumstance whatsoever and without regard to the
      termination of this Credit Agreement or the Commitments hereunder, the
      existence of a Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of the
      obligations of the Borrower hereunder and shall be made without any
      offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Simultaneously
      with the making of each such payment by a Lender to the Agent for the
      account of the applicable Issuing Lender, such Lender shall, automatically
      and without any further action on the part of the Agent, the applicable
      Issuing Lender or such Lender, acquire a Participation Interest in an
      amount equal to such payment (excluding the portion of such payment
      constituting interest owing to the applicable Issuing Lender) in the
      related unreimbursed drawing portion of the LOC


                                       32
<PAGE>
      Obligation and in the interest thereon, and shall have a claim against the
      Borrower with respect thereto.

            (e)   Repayment with Revolving Loans. On any day on which the
      Borrower shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a
      Revolving Loan advance to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit,
      the Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that a Revolving Loan has been
      requested or deemed requested by the Borrower to be made in connection
      with a drawing under a Letter of Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan
      advance comprised of Base Rate Loans shall be immediately made to the
      Borrower by all Lenders (notwithstanding any termination of the
      Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2) pro rata based on the respective
      Commitment Percentages of the Lenders (determined before giving effect to
      any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2) and the
      proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to the Agent for the account of
      the applicable Issuing Lender for application to the respective LOC
      Obligations. Each such Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make its pro
      rata share of each such Revolving Loan immediately upon any such request
      or deemed request in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified
      in the preceding sentence notwithstanding (i) the amount of such borrowing
      may not comply with the minimum amount for advances of Revolving Loans
      otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in
      Section 5.2 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of
      Default then exists, (iv) failure of any such request or deemed request
      for Revolving Loan to be made by the time otherwise required hereunder,
      (v) whether the date of such borrowing is a date on which Revolving Loans
      are otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (vi) any termination of
      the Commitments immediately prior to or contemporaneously with such
      borrowing. In the event that any Revolving Loan cannot for any reason be
      made on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation,
      as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code
      with respect to the Borrower or any other Credit Party), then each such
      Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date such
      borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments
      received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such
      purchase) from the applicable Issuing Lender such Participation Interests
      in the outstanding LOC Obligations as shall be necessary to cause each
      such Lender to share in such LOC Obligations ratably (based upon the
      respective Commitment Percentages of the Lenders (determined before giving
      effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2)),
      provided that at the time any purchase of Participation Interests pursuant
      to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required
      to pay to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender, to
      the extent not paid to the applicable Issuing Lender by the Borrower in
      accordance with the terms of subsection (d) above, interest on the
      principal amount of Participation Interests purchased for each day from
      and including the day upon which such borrowing would otherwise have
      occurred to but excluding the date of payment for such Participation
      Interests, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of
      the date of the Revolving Loan advance, the Federal Funds Rate, and
      thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate.

            (f)   Designation of Consolidated Parties as Account Parties.
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Credit
      Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.2(a), a Letter of Credit
      issued hereunder may be issued for the account of a


                                       33
<PAGE>
      Consolidated Party other than the Borrower, provided that notwithstanding
      such statement, the Borrower shall be the actual account party for all
      purposes of this Credit Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such
      statement shall not affect the Borrower's reimbursement obligations
      hereunder with respect to such Letter of Credit.

            (g)   Renewal, Extension. The renewal or extension of any Letter of
      Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as
      the issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

            (h)   Uniform Customs and Practices. The applicable Issuing Lender
      may have the Letters of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs and
      Practice for Documentary Credits, as published as of the date of issue by
      the International Chamber of Commerce (the "UCP"), in which case the UCP
      may be incorporated therein and deemed in all respects to be a part
      thereof. Standby Letters of Credit may also be subject to IFP98
      (International Standby Practice).

            (i)   Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender's Duties.

                  (i)   In addition to its other obligations under this Section
            2.2, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay, and protect, indemnify and
            save each Lender harmless from and against, any and all claims,
            demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses
            (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that such Lender may incur or
            be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the
            issuance of any Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of such Lender
            to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act
            or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future
            de jure or de facto government or Governmental Authority (all such
            acts or omissions, herein called "Government Acts").

                  (ii)  As between the Borrower and the Lenders (including the
            applicable Issuing Lender), the Borrower shall assume all risks of
            the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the
            beneficiary thereof. No Lender (including the applicable Issuing
            Lender) shall be responsible: (A) for the form, validity,
            sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document
            submitted by any party in connection with the application for and
            issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to
            be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate,
            fraudulent or forged; (B) for the validity or sufficiency of any
            instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or
            assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or
            proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid
            or ineffective for any reason; (C) for errors, omissions,
            interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages,
            by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they
            be in cipher; (D) for any loss or delay in the transmission or
            otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under
            a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and (E) for any
            consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such Lender,
            including, without limitation, any Government Acts. None of the
            above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the applicable
            Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

                  (iii) Nothing in this subsection (i) is intended to limit the
            reimbursement obligations of the Borrower contained in subsection
            (d) above. The obligations of the Borrower under this subsection (i)
            shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement. No act or
            omission of any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit
            shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the Lenders
            (including the applicable Issuing Lender) to enforce any right,
            power or benefit under this Credit Agreement.

                  (iv)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
            this subsection (i), the Borrower shall have no obligation to
            indemnify any Lender (including the applicable Issuing Lender) in
            respect of any liability incurred by such Lender (A) arising out of
            the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender, or (B)
            caused by such Lender's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit
            after presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the
            terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, unless such payment
            is prohibited by any law, regulation, court order or decree.

            (j)   Responsibility of Issuing Lender. It is expressly understood
      and agreed that the obligations of the applicable Issuing Lender hereunder
      to the Lenders are only those expressly set forth in this Credit Agreement
      and that the applicable Issuing Lender shall be entitled to assume that
      the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 have been satisfied
      unless it shall have acquired actual knowledge that any such condition
      precedent has not been satisfied; provided, however, that nothing set
      forth in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any
      Lender to recover from the applicable Issuing Lender any amounts made
      available by such Lender to the applicable Issuing Lender pursuant to this
      Section 2.2 in the event that it is determined by a court of competent
      jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit
      constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
      applicable Issuing Lender.

            (k)   Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any conflict
      between this Credit Agreement and any LOC Document (including any letter
      of credit application), this Credit Agreement shall control.

      2.3   SWINGLINE LOAN SUBFACILITY OF THE REVOLVER.

            (a)   Swingline Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions
      hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth
      herein, the Swingline Lender, in its individual capacity, agrees to make
      certain revolving credit loans requested by the Borrower in Dollars to the
      Borrower (each a "Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the "Swingline
      Loans") from time to time from the Closing Date until the Maturity Date
      for the purposes hereinafter set forth; provided, however, (i) the
      aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time
      shall not exceed TEN MILLION DOLLARS ($10,000,000) (the "Swingline
      Committed Amount"), and (ii) the sum of the aggregate outstanding
      principal amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations plus Swingline


                                       35
<PAGE>
      Loans shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. Swingline Loans
      hereunder may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
      hereof.

            (b)   Swingline Loan Advances.

                  (i)   Notices; Disbursement. Whenever the Borrower desires a
            Swingline Loan advance hereunder it shall give written notice (or
            telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Swingline
            Lender not later than 3:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on
            the Business Day of the requested Swingline Loan advance. Each such
            notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A) that a Swingline
            Loan advance is requested, (B) the date of the requested Swingline
            Loan advance (which shall be a Business Day) and (C) the principal
            amount of the Swingline Loan advance requested. Each Swingline Loan
            shall be made as a Base Rate Loan and shall have such maturity date
            as the Swingline Lender and the Borrower shall agree upon receipt by
            the Swingline Lender of any such notice from the Borrower. The
            Swingline Lender shall initiate the transfer of funds representing
            the Swingline Loan advance to the Borrower by 3:00 P.M. (Charlotte,
            North Carolina time) on the Business Day of the requested borrowing.

                  (ii)  Minimum Amounts. Each Swingline Loan advance shall be in
            a minimum principal amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of
            $100,000 (or the remaining amount of the Swingline Committed Amount,
            if less).

                  (iii) Repayment of Swingline Loans. The principal amount of
            all Swingline Loans shall be due and payable on the earlier of (A)
            the maturity date agreed to by the Swingline Lender and the Borrower
            with respect to such Loan (which maturity date shall not be a date
            more than seven (7) Business Days from the date of advance thereof)
            or (B) the Maturity Date. The Swingline Lender may, at any time, in
            its sole discretion, by written notice to the Borrower and the
            Lenders, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans by way of a
            Revolving Loan advance, in which case the Borrower shall be deemed
            to have requested a Revolving Loan advance comprised solely of Base
            Rate Loans in the amount of such Swingline Loans; provided, however,
            that any such demand shall be deemed to have been given one Business
            Day prior to the Maturity Date and on the date of the occurrence of
            any Event of Default described in Section 9.1 and upon acceleration
            of the indebtedness hereunder and the exercise of remedies in
            accordance with the provisions of Section 9.2. Each Lender hereby
            irrevocably agrees to make its pro rata share of each such Revolving
            Loan in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified in the
            preceding sentence notwithstanding (I) the amount of such borrowing
            may not comply with the minimum amount for advances of Revolving
            Loans otherwise required hereunder, (II) whether any conditions
            specified in Section 5.2 are then satisfied, (III) whether a Default
            or an Event of Default then exists, (IV) failure of any such request
            or deemed request for Revolving Loan to be made by the time
            otherwise required hereunder, (V) whether the date of such borrowing
            is a date on which Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be
            made hereunder or (VI) any termination of the Commitments relating
            thereto immediately


                                       36
<PAGE>
            prior to or contemporaneously with such borrowing. In the event that
            any Revolving Loan cannot for any reason be made on the date
            otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result
            of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with
            respect to the Borrower or any other Credit Party), then each Lender
            hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date such
            borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any
            payments received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior
            to such purchase) from the Swingline Lender such Participation
            Interests in the outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary
            to cause each such Lender to share in such Swingline Loans ratably
            based upon its Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed
            Amount (determined before giving effect to any termination of the
            Commitments pursuant to Section 3.4), provided that (A) all interest
            payable on the Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the
            Swingline Lender until the date as of which the respective
            Participation Interest is purchased and (B) at the time any purchase
            of Participation Interests pursuant to this sentence is actually
            made, the purchasing Lender shall be required to pay to the
            Swingline Lender, to the extent not paid to the Swingline Lender by
            the Borrower in accordance with the terms of subsection (c)(ii)
            below, interest on the principal amount of Participation Interests
            purchased for each day from and including the day upon which such
            borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of
            payment for such Participation Interests, at the rate equal to the
            Federal Funds Rate.

            (c)   Interest on Swingline Loans.

                  (i)   Rate of Interest . Subject to the provisions of Section
            3.1, each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate
            equal to the Base Rate.

                  (ii)  Payment of Interest. Interest on Swingline Loans shall
            be payable in arrears on each applicable Interest Payment Date (or
            at such other times as may be specified herein), unless accelerated
            sooner pursuant to Section 9.2.

            (d)   Swingline Note. The Swingline Loans shall be evidenced by a
      duly executed promissory note of the Borrower to the Swingline Lender in
      an original principal amount equal to the Swingline Committed Amount
      substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.3(d).

                                    SECTION 3

                  OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITY

      3.1   DEFAULT RATE.

      Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of a default in the
payment of any amount hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the other
Credit Documents, such overdue amount shall bear interest, payable on demand, at
a per annum rate 2% greater than the rate which would


                                       37
<PAGE>
otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable, whether in respect of
interest, fees or other amounts, then the Adjusted Base Rate plus 2%).

      3.2   EXTENSION AND CONVERSION.

      The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend
      existing Loans into a subsequent permissible Interest Period or to convert
      Loans into Loans of another interest rate type; provided, however, that
      (i) except as provided in Section 3.8, Eurodollar Loans may be converted
      into Base Rate Loans or extended as Eurodollar Loans for new Interest
      Periods only on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
      (ii) without the consent of the Requisite Lenders, Eurodollar Loans may be
      extended, and Base Rate Loans may be converted into Eurodollar Loans, only
      if the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied on the
      date of extension or conversion, (iii) Loans extended as, or converted
      into, Eurodollar Loans shall be subject to the terms of the definition of
      "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and shall be in such minimum
      amounts as provided in, with respect to Revolving Loans, Section
      2.1(b)(ii), (iv) no more than 6 Eurodollar Loans which are Revolving Loans
      shall be outstanding hereunder at any time (it being understood that, for
      purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods shall be
      considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on the same
      date, although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in accordance
      with the provisions hereof, be combined at the end of existing Interest
      Periods to constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest
      Period), (v) any request for extension or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan
      which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be deemed to be a
      request for an Interest Period of one month and (vi) Swingline Loans may
      not be extended or converted pursuant to this Section 3.2. Each such
      extension or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving a
      Notice of Extension/Conversion (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
      writing) to the office of the Agent specified in Schedule 2.1(a), or at
      such other office as the Agent may designate in writing, prior to 12:00
      Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business Day of, in the case
      of the conversion of a Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan, and on the
      third Business Day prior to, in the case of the extension of a Eurodollar
      Loan as, or conversion of a Base Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan, the
      date of the proposed extension or conversion, specifying the date of the
      proposed extension or conversion, the Loans to be so extended or
      converted, the types of Loans into which such Loans are to be converted
      and, if appropriate, the applicable Interest Periods with respect thereto.
      Each request for extension or conversion shall be irrevocable and shall
      constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower of the matters
      specified in clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 5.2. In the event
      the Borrower fails to request extension or conversion of any Eurodollar
      Loan in accordance with this Section 3.2, or any such conversion or
      extension is not permitted or required by this Credit Agreement, then such
      Eurodollar Loan shall be automatically converted into a Base Rate Loan at
      the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. The Agent shall give
      each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed
      extension or conversion affecting any Loan.


                                       38

      3.3   PREPAYMENTS.

            (a)   Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to
      prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time; provided, however,
      that each partial prepayment of Loans (other than Swingline Loans) shall
      be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of
      $250,000 in excess thereof (or the then remaining principal balance of the
      Revolving Loans, if less). Subject to the foregoing terms, amounts prepaid
      under this Section 3.3(a) shall be applied as the Borrower may elect;
      provided that if the Borrower shall fail to specify, voluntary prepayments
      shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in
      direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this
      Section 3.3(a) shall be subject to Section 3.12, but otherwise without
      premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal
      amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

            (b)   Mandatory Prepayments.

                  (i)   (A)   Revolving Committed Amount. If at any time, the
            sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans
            plus LOC Obligations plus Swingline Loans shall exceed the Revolving
            Committed Amount, the Borrower immediately shall prepay the
            Revolving Loans and (after all Revolving Loans have been repaid)
            cash collateralize the LOC Obligations, in an amount sufficient to
            eliminate such excess.

                        (B)   LOC Committed Amount. If at any time, the sum of
                  the aggregate principal amount of LOC Obligations shall exceed
                  the LOC Committed Amount, the Borrower immediately shall cash
                  collateralize the LOC Obligations in an amount sufficient to
                  eliminate such excess.

                  (ii)  (A)   Asset Dispositions. Immediately upon the
            occurrence of any Asset Disposition Prepayment Event, the Borrower
            shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the
            Net Cash Proceeds of the related Asset Disposition not applied (or
            caused to be applied) by the Credit Parties during the related
            Application Period to make Eligible Reinvestments as contemplated by
            the terms of Section 8.5(g) (such prepayment to be applied as set
            forth in clause (iii) below).

                        (B)   Casualty and Condemnation Events. Immediately upon
                  the occurrence of any event requiring application of any
                  insurance proceeds to the prepayment of Loans (and cash
                  collateralization of LOC Obligations) pursuant to Section
                  7.6(b), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in the amount
                  required by such Section 7.6(b) (such prepayment to be applied
                  as set forth in clause (iii) below).

                  (iii) Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All amounts
            required to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be applied
            as follows: (A) with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant to
            Section 3.3(b)(i)(A), to Revolving Loans (without


                                       39
<PAGE>
            any reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount) and (after all
            Revolving Loans have been repaid) to a cash collateral account in
            respect of LOC Obligations, (B) with respect to all amounts prepaid
            pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i)(B), to a cash collateral account in
            respect of LOC Obligations and (C) with respect to all amounts
            prepaid pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(ii), first, to the Swingline
            Loans, second (after all Swingline Loans have been repaid), to
            Revolving Loans and, third (after all Revolving Loans have been
            repaid), to a cash collateral account in respect of LOC Obligations
            (without a corresponding permanent reduction in the Revolving
            Committed Amount in connection with any application required
            pursuant to this Section 3.3(b)). Within the parameters of the
            applications set forth above, prepayments shall be applied first to
            Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans subject to Section
            3.3(b)(iv) in direct order of Interest Period maturities. All
            prepayments under this Section 3.3(b) shall be subject to Section
            3.12, but otherwise without premium or penalty, and shall be
            accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid through the
            date of prepayment.

                  (iv)  Prepayment Account. If the Borrower is required to make
            a mandatory prepayment of Eurodollar Loans under this Section
            3.3(b), the Borrower shall have the right, in lieu of making such
            prepayment in full, to deposit an amount equal to such mandatory
            prepayment with the Agent in a cash collateral account maintained
            (pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Agent) by
            and in the sole dominion and control of the Agent. Any amounts so
            deposited shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the
            prepayment of such Eurodollar Loans and shall be applied to the
            prepayment of the applicable Eurodollar Loans at the end of the
            current Interest Periods applicable thereto. At the request of the
            Borrower, amounts so deposited shall be invested by the Agent in
            Cash Equivalents maturing prior to the date or dates on which it is
            anticipated that such amounts will be applied to prepay such
            Eurodollar Loans; any interest earned on such Cash Equivalents will
            be for the account of the Borrower and the Borrower will deposit
            with the Agent the amount of any loss on any such Cash Equivalents
            to the extent necessary in order that the amount of the prepayment
            to be made with the deposited amounts may not be reduced.

      3.4   TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITTED AMOUNT.

            (a)   Voluntary Reductions. The Borrower may from time to time
      permanently reduce or terminate the Revolving Committed Amount in whole or
      in part (in minimum aggregate amounts of $5,000,000 or in integral
      multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the full remaining
      amount of the then applicable Revolving Committed Amount)) upon five
      Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent; provided, however, no
      such termination or reduction shall be made which would cause the sum of
      the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC
      Obligations plus Swingline Loans to exceed the Revolving Committed Amount
      unless, concurrently with such termination or reduction, the Revolving
      Loans are repaid to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess. The
      Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender of receipt by the Agent
      of any notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.4(a).


                                       40
<PAGE>
            (b)   Maturity Date. The Revolving Commitments of the Lenders, the
      LOC Commitment of the Issuing Lender(s) and the Swingline Commitment of
      the Swingline Lender shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.

            (c)   General. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account
      of the Lenders in accordance with the terms of Section 3.5(b), on the date

      for the benefit of the Lenders, on the Closing Date an underwriting fee in

            (b)   Unused Fee. In consideration of the Revolving Commitments of

      equal to .50%. The Unused Fee shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date
      and shall be due and payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each
      March, June, September and December (and on any date that the Revolving
      Committed Amount is reduced and on the Maturity Date) for the immediately
      preceding quarter (or portion thereof) (each such quarter or portion
      thereof for which the Unused Fee is payable hereunder being herein

            Percentage of the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn
            under each such trade Letter of Credit computed at a per annum rate
            for each


                                       41

            of Credit Fee payable pursuant to clause (i) above and the Trade
            Letter of Credit Fee payable pursuant to clause (ii) above, the
            Borrower promises to pay to the Agent for the account of the
            applicable Issuing Lender, without sharing by the other Lenders, (i)
            a letter of credit fronting fee of 1/4% on the average daily maximum
            amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit computed at
            a per annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date
            of expiration (which fronting fee shall be payable quarterly in
            arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and

            (d)   Administrative Fees. The Borrower promises to pay to the
      Agent, for its own account and for the account of Banc of America
      Securities LLC, as applicable, the fees referred to in the Agent's Fee

      3.6   CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

      If any Lender has determined, after the date hereof, that the adoption or
the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof in the interpretation or administration of, any
applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or compliance by
such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for
such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon notice from
such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
reduction. Each determination by any such Lender of amounts owing under this
Section shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties
hereto. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 3.6, none of the
Lenders shall be entitled to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 3.6,
if it shall not be the general practice of such Lender to demand such
compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other
comparable credit agreements.

      3.7   LIMITATION ON EURODOLLAR LOANS.

      If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Loan:


                                       42
<PAGE>
            (a)   the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
      that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate
      and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for
      such Interest Period; or

            (b)   the Requisite Lenders determine (which determination shall be
      conclusive) and notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate will not
      adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding
      Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to
make additional Eurodollar Loans, Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base
Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of
the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either
prepay such Eurodollar Loans or Convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement.

      3.8   ILLEGALITY.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, in the event
that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to
make, maintain, or fund Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower thereof and such Lender's obligation to make or
Continue Eurodollar Loans and to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans
shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make, maintain, and
fund Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be
applicable).

      3.9   REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

      If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule, or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

            (i)   shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office)
      to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any Eurodollar Loans,
      its Notes, or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or change the basis
      of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender (or its Applicable
      Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or its Notes in respect of any
      Eurodollar Loans (other than franchise taxes and taxes imposed on the
      overall net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender
      is organized or any political subdivision thereof or therein or has its
      principal office or such Applicable Lending Office);

            (ii)  shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special
      deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than the Eurodollar
      Reserve Requirement utilized in the determination of the Adjusted
      Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of,
      or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender
      (or its Applicable Lending Office), including the Commitment of such
      Lender hereunder; or


                                       43
<PAGE>
            (iii) shall impose on such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office)
      or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Credit
      Agreement or its Notes or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities
      or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, Converting into, Continuing, or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by
such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or
its Notes with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender within 5 Business Days following demand such amount or amounts as
will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction; provided that
such increases or reductions shall not include any increased costs or reductions
in respect of taxes that are governed by the provisions of Section 3.11, and the
provisions of this Section 3.9 shall not be interpreted to cause a duplication
in payment or treatment of any taxes in a manner inconsistent with the
provisions of Section 3.11. If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower
under this Section 3.9, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy
to the Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue
Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans, until the
event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which
case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be applicable); provided that such
suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation
so requested. Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of
any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will
entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 3.9 and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid
the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the
judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. Any Lender claiming
compensation under this Section 3.9 shall furnish to the Borrower and the Agent
a statement setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In
determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

      3.10  TREATMENT OF AFFECTED LOANS.

      If the obligation of any Lender to make any Eurodollar Loan or to
Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be
suspended pursuant to Section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof, such Lender's Eurodollar
Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s)
of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurodollar Loans (or, in the
case of a Conversion, on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the
Borrower with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives
notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 3.7, 3.8 or
3.9 hereof that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

            (a)   to the extent that such Lender's Eurodollar Loans have been so
      Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise
      be applied to such Lender's Eurodollar Loans shall be applied instead to
      its Base Rate Loans; and

            (b)   all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such
      Lender as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate
      Loans, and all Base Rate

                                       44
<PAGE>
      Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be
      Converted into Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) that the
circumstances specified in Section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to the
Conversion of such Lender's Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this Section 3.10 no
longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances
ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other Lenders are
outstanding, such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on
the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto,
all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Loans and by such Lender are
held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest
Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

      3.11  TAXES.

            (a)   Any and all payments by any Credit Party to or for the account
      of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any other Credit Document
      shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all
      present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
      withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the
      case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and
      franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
      such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the Agent (as the case
      may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof or therein (all
      such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
      withholdings, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").
      If any Credit Party shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or
      in respect of any sum payable under this Credit Agreement or any other
      Credit Document to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be
      increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
      (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
      Section 3.11) such Lender or the Agent receives an amount equal to the sum
      it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Credit
      Party shall make such deductions, (iii) such Credit Party shall pay the
      full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority
      in accordance with applicable law, and (iv) such Credit Party shall
      furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 11.1, the
      original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

            (b)   In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
      future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes
      or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under this
      Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or from the execution or
      delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Credit Agreement or any
      other Credit Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

            (c)   The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Agent for
      the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without limitation,
      any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on
      amounts payable under this Section 3.11) paid by such Lender or the Agent
      (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest, and
      expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.


                                       45
<PAGE>
            (d)   Each Lender on or prior to the date of its execution and

      delivery of this Credit Agreement in the case of each Lender listed on the
      signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a
      Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter
      if requested in writing by the Borrower or the Agent (but only so long as
      such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower
      and the Agent with (A) if such Lender is a United States person under
      Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (other than any such Lender that is a
      financial institution whose name includes the word "Bank", "Credit Union",
      "Savings and Loan" or "Mutual Savings Bank"), Internal Revenue Service
      Form W-9 or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service
      or (B) if such Lender is not a United States person under Section
      7701(a)(30) of the Code (i) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN or W-8
      ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal
      Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under
      an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces
      to zero the rate of withholding tax on payments of hereunder or under any
      other Credit Document or certifying that the income receivable hereunder
      or under any other Credit Document is effectively connected with the
      conduct of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) with respect
      to payments of interest, if such Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning
      of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a certificate substantially in the
      form of Exhibit 3.11(d) and Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN. The
      Borrower shall be entitled to rely on such forms in its possession until
      receipt of any revised or successor form pursuant to this Section 3.11(d).

            (e)   For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to
      provide the Borrower and the Agent with the appropriate form pursuant to
      Section 3.11(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law, or
      regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was
      required to be provided), (i) the Borrower shall be entitled to deduct or
      withhold on payments to the Agent or such Lender as a result of such
      failure, as required by law, and (ii) the Borrower shall not be required
      to make payments of additional amounts with respect to such withheld
      amounts pursuant to Section 3.11(a) (or to indemnify a Lender pursuant to
      Section 3.11(c)) to the extent such withholding (or liability for Tax) is
      required solely by reason of the failure of the Agent or such Lender to
      provide the necessary certificate, document or other evidence of an
      exemption from withholding; provided, however, that should a Lender, which
      is otherwise exempt from withholding tax, become subject to Taxes because
      of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall
      take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such
      Lender to recover such Taxes.

            (f)   If any Credit Party is required to pay additional amounts to
      or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.11, then such
      Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of
      its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such
      additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the
      judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

            (g)   Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
      the Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Credit
      Parties contained in this


                                       46
<PAGE>
      Section 3.11 shall survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and
      other obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination of the
      Commitments hereunder.

      3.12  COMPENSATION.

      Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense (excluding loss of
anticipated profits) incurred by it as a result of:

            (a)   any payment, prepayment, or Conversion of a Eurodollar Loan
      for any reason (including, without limitation, (i) in connection with any
      assignment by Bank of America pursuant to Section 11.3(b) as part of the
      primary syndication of the Loans during the 180-day period immediately
      following the Closing Date and (ii) the acceleration of the Loans pursuant
      to Section 9.2) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period
      for such Loan; or

            (b)   any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including, without
      limitation, the failure of any condition precedent specified in Section 5
      to be satisfied) to borrow, Convert, Continue, or prepay a Eurodollar Loan
      on the date for such borrowing, Conversion, Continuation, or prepayment
      specified in the relevant notice of borrowing, prepayment, Continuation,
      or Conversion under this Credit Agreement.

With respect to Eurodollar Loans, such indemnification may include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, Converted or Continued,
for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow,
Convert or Continue to the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow, Convert or Continue, the Interest Period that
would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable
rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein (excluding,
however, the Applicable Percentage included therein, if any) over (b) the amount
of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued
to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable
period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. The covenants of
the Borrower set forth in this Section 3.12 shall survive the repayment of the
Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under the Credit Documents and the
termination of the Commitments hereunder.

      3.13  PRO RATA TREATMENT.

      Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

            (a)   Loans. Each Loan, each payment or (subject to the terms of
      Section 3.3) prepayment of principal of any Loan or reimbursement
      obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of
      interest on the Loans or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings
      under Letters of Credit, each payment of Unused Fees, each payment of the
      Standby Letter of Credit Fee, each payment of the Trade Letter of Credit
      Fee, each reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount and each conversion
      or extension of any


                                       47
<PAGE>
      Loan, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the
      respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans of the applicable
      type and Participation Interests in Loans of the applicable type and
      Letters of Credit.

            (b)   Advances. No Lender shall be responsible for the failure or
      delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make its ratable share of a
      borrowing hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to
      fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of
      its obligations hereunder. Unless the Agent shall have been notified by
      any Lender prior to the date of any requested borrowing that such Lender
      does not intend to make available to the Agent its ratable share of such
      borrowing to be made on such date, the Agent may assume that such Lender
      has made such amount available to the Agent on the date of such borrowing,
      and the Agent in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole
      discretion but without any obligation to do so) make available to the
      Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in
      fact made available to the Agent, the Agent shall be able to recover such
      corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such
      corresponding amount forthwith upon the Agent's demand therefor, the Agent
      will promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall within 3
      Business Days after demand pay such corresponding amount to the Agent. The
      Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrower,
      as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of
      each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the
      Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered
      by the Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i) from the Borrower at the
      applicable rate for the applicable borrowing pursuant to the Notice of
      Borrowing and (ii) from a Lender at the Federal Funds Rate.

      3.14  SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

      The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender
shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan, LOC Obligations or any other
obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise
of a right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured
claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security
or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such
Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such
payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly
purchase from the other Lenders a Participation Interest in such Loans, LOC
Obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other
adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders
share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as
provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree among
themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the
exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as
aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which
shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a
Participation Interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
(together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto)
to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment,
including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such
Participation Interest


                                       48
<PAGE>
as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan, LOC Obligations or other
obligation in the amount of such Participation Interest. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit
to the Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to the Agent
or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such
amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for
each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to
the Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any
Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.14
applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in
respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the
Lenders under this Section 3.14 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such
secured claim.

      3.15  PAYMENTS, COMPUTATIONS, ETC.

      (a)   Generally. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all
payments hereunder shall be made to the Agent in Dollars in immediately
available funds, without setoff, deduction, counterclaim or withholding of any
kind, at the Agent's office specified in Schedule 2.1(a) not later than 2:00
P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due. Payments received
after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day. The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under this
Credit Agreement, specify to the Agent the Loans, LOC Obligations, Fees,
interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such
payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify, the
Agent shall distribute such payments first to Swingline Loans and second to
Revolving Loans (first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct
order of Interest Period maturities), and, after all Revolving Loans have been
repaid, to a cash collateral account in respect of LOC Obligations. The Agent
will distribute such payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is received
prior to 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on a Business Day in like
funds as received prior to the end of such Business Day and otherwise the Agent
will distribute such payment to such Lenders on the next succeeding Business
Day. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is
not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and Fees for the period
of such extension), except that in the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the
extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following calendar
month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next preceding Business
Day. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, all computations of interest
and fees shall be made on the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year
of 360 days, except with respect to computation of interest on Base Rate Loans
which shall be calculated based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate.
Interest shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing, but exclude the
date of payment.

      (b)   Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after acceleration of
the Credit Party Obligations pursuant to Section 9.2, all amounts collected or
received by the Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit Party Obligations
or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents or in respect
of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows:


                                       49
<PAGE>
                           FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of the Agent in connection with enforcing the
                  rights of the Lenders under the Credit Documents and any
                  protective advances made by the Agent with respect to the
                  Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the Collateral
                  Documents;

                           SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent;

                           THIRD, to the payment of all of the Credit Party
                  Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest;

                           FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal
                  amount of the Credit Party Obligations (including the payment
                  or cash collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations);

                           FIFTH, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with
                  enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise
                  with respect to the Credit Party Obligations owing to such
                  Lender;

                           SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and
                  other obligations which shall have become due and payable
                  under the Credit Documents or otherwise and not repaid
                  pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above; and

                           SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to
                  whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

         In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in
         the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to
         the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an
         amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the
         then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to
         the aggregate then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts
         available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH"
         and "SIXTH" above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available
         for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to
         the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such
         amounts shall be held by the Agent in a cash collateral account and
         applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender(s) from time to time
         for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following
         the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of
         the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above in the manner
         provided in this Section 3.15(b).

         3.16     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

                  (a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts
         evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to
         time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
         to such Lender from time to time under this Credit


                                       50
<PAGE>
         Agreement. Each Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the
         accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account
         or accounts from time to time, as necessary.

                  (b) The Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section
         11.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and
         subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and
         Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any
         principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to
         each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
         Agent hereunder from or for the account of any Credit Party and each
         Lender's share thereof. The Agent will make reasonable efforts to
         maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding
         sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as
         necessary.

                  (c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts
         maintained pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 3.16 (and, if
         consistent with the entries of the Agent, clause (a)) shall be prima
         facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the
         Credit Parties therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of
         any Lender or the Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or
         such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any
         manner affect the obligation of the Credit Parties to repay the Credit
         Party Obligations owing to such Lender.

         3.17     REPLACEMENT OF AFFECTED LENDERS.

         If any Lender having a Revolving Commitment becomes a Defaulting Lender
or otherwise defaults in its Revolving Commitment or if any Lender is owed
increased costs under Section 3.6, Section 3.8, Section 3.9, or, or the Borrower
is required to make any payments under Section 3.11 to any Lender in excess of
those to the other Lenders or if any Lender elects not to enter into any
amendment, modification, consent or waiver with respect to the Credit Agreement
or any other Credit Document requested by the Borrower, which amendment,
modification, consent or waiver cannot become effective without the consent of
such Lender, the Borrower shall have the right, if no Event of Default then
exists, to replace such Lender (the "Replaced Lender") with one or more other
Eligible Assignee or Eligible Assignees, none of whom shall constitute a
Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement (collectively, the
"Replacement Lender"), provided that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant
to this Section 3.17, the Replaced Lender and Replacement Lender shall enter
into an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit 11.3(b), pursuant to
which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be,
of the Commitments and outstanding Loans of, and participation in Letters of
Credit by, the Replaced Lender and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to
the Replaced Lender relating to the Loans so replaced (including, without
limitation, such increased costs and excluding those specifically described in
clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or
is concurrently being paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender
concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the assignment
documentation, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above
and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender, delivery to the Replacement
Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by the Borrower, the
Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall
cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to


                                       51
<PAGE>
such replaced Loans, except with respect to indemnification provisions under
this Agreement, which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained above, (1) any Lender that acts as an Issuing
Lender may not be replaced hereunder at any time that it has Letters of Credit
outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to such Lender (including
the furnishing of a back-up standby letter of credit in form and substance, and
issued by an issuer satisfactory to such Lender or the depositing of cash
collateral into a cash collateral account maintained with the Agent in amounts
and pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to such Lender) have been made with
respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit and (2) the Lender that acts as
the Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of
Section 10.7. The Replaced Lender shall be required to deliver for cancellation
its applicable Notes to be canceled on the date of replacement, or if any such
Note is lost or unavailable, such other assurances or indemnification therefor
as the Borrower may reasonably request.


                                    SECTION 4

                                    GUARANTY

         4.1      THE GUARANTY.

         Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement, and the
Agent as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt
payment of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof.
The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Credit Party Obligations
are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same,
without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension
of time of payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same
will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a
mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements, the obligations of each
Guarantor under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be
limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render
such obligations subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code
or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.

         4.2      OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.1 are joint and
several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or Hedging
Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any
substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or
security


                                       52
<PAGE>
for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or
guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the obligations of the
Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of
subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or
any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until such time as the
Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or
impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall remain absolute and
unconditional as described above:

                  (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any
         Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of
         the Credit Party Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or
         compliance shall be waived;

                  (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any
         of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between the Borrower and
         any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or
         instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging
         Agreements shall be done or omitted;

                  (c) the maturity of any of the Credit Party Obligations shall
         be accelerated, or any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
         modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under
         any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between the Borrower
         and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or
         instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging
         Agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Credit
         Party Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired
         or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

                  (d) any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Agent or any
         Lender or Lenders as security for any of the Credit Party Obligations
         shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

                  (e) any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be determined to
         be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of
         any creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims
         of any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any
         Guarantor).

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices
whatsoever, and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender exhaust any right,
power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Credit Documents,
any Hedging Agreement between the Borrower and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a
Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents
or such Hedging Agreements, or against any other Person under any other
guarantee of, or security for, any of the Credit Party Obligations.


                                       53
<PAGE>
         4.3      REINSTATEMENT.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party
Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify
the Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration,
including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim
alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or
similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

         4.4      CERTAIN ADDITIONAL WAIVERS.

         In the event that North Carolina law is determined to be controlling in
any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Section 4 notwithstanding
the parties' contractual choice of New York law pursuant to Section 11.10(a),
each Guarantor hereby specifically waives the benefits of N.C. Gen. Stat.
Sections 26-7 through 26-9, inclusive, to the extent applicable. Each
Guarantor further agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of recourse to
security for the Credit Party Obligations, except through the exercise of rights
of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the exercise of rights of
contribution pursuant to Section 4.6.

         4.5      REMEDIES.

         The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Agent and the Lenders, on the
other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 9.2)
for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Credit Party
Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other
Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Credit Party
Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the
Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section
4.1. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are
secured in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents and that the
Lenders may exercise their remedies thereunder in accordance with the terms
thereof.

         4.6      RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor
shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Guarantor shall have a
right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor's Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The
payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be subordinate
and subject in right of payment to the Credit Party Obligations until such time
as the Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied, and none of the
Guarantors shall exercise


                                       54
<PAGE>
any right or remedy under this Section 4.6 against any other Guarantor until
such Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied. For purposes of this
Section 4.6, (a) "Excess Payment" shall mean the amount paid by any Guarantor in
excess of its Pro Rata Share of any Credit Party Obligations; (b) "Pro Rata
Share" shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any payment of Credit Party
Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such
payment of Credit Party Obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate
present fair salable value on a going concern basis of all of its assets and
properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities,
but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by
which the aggregate present fair salable value on a going concern basis of all
assets and other properties of all of the Credit Parties exceeds the amount of
all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured,
and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit
Parties hereunder) of the Credit Parties; provided, however, that, for purposes
of calculating the Pro Rata Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any payment
of Credit Party Obligations, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to
the date of any such payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the
date of such payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the
date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in
connection with such payment; and (e) "Contribution Share" shall mean, for any
Guarantor in respect of any Excess Payment made by any other Guarantor, the
ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i)
the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value on a going concern
basis of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and
liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured,
and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value
on a going concern basis of all assets and other properties of the Credit
Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of all of
the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and
unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties)
of the Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment; provided,
however, that, for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of the
Guarantors in respect of any Excess Payment, any Guarantor that became a
Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such Excess Payment shall be deemed to
have been a Guarantor on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial
information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor
shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such Excess Payment.
This Section 4.6 shall not be deemed to affect any right of subrogation,
indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that any Guarantor may have under
applicable law against the Borrower in respect of any payment of Credit Party
Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights of contribution against
any Guarantor shall terminate from and after such time, if ever, that such
Guarantor shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to Section 8.5.

         4.7      GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT; CONTINUING GUARANTEE.

         The guarantee in this Section 4 is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Credit Party
Obligations whenever arising.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Credit Parties hereby represent to the Agent and each Lender that:

         6.1      FINANCIAL CONDITION.

                  (a) The audited consolidated balance sheets and income
         statements of the Consolidated Parties for the fiscal year ended
         December 31, 2000 (including the notes thereto) (i) have been audited
         by KPMG Peat Marwick, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
         consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby and


                                       59
<PAGE>
         (iii) present fairly in all material respects (on the basis disclosed
         in the footnotes to such financial statements) the consolidated
         financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
         Consolidated Parties as of such date and for such periods. The
         unaudited interim balance sheets of the Consolidated Parties as at the
         end of, and the related unaudited interim statements of earnings and of
         cash flows for, each fiscal quarterly period ended after December 31,
         2000 and prior to the Closing Date (i) have been prepared in accordance
         with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby,
         and (ii) present fairly in all material respects the consolidated and
         consolidating financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
         of the Consolidated Parties as of such date and for such periods except
         that they do not contain the materials and disclosures to be found in
         notes to financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP nor do
         they reflect year-end adjustments. During the period from December 31,
         2000 to and including the Closing Date, there has been no sale,
         transfer or other disposition by any Consolidated Party of any material
         part of the business or property of the Consolidated Parties, taken as
         a whole, and no purchase or other acquisition (other than O'Grady
         Peyton International (USA), Inc. and its subsidiaries) by any of them
         of any business or property (including any Capital Stock of any other
         Person) material in relation to the consolidated financial condition of
         the Consolidated Parties, taken as a whole, in each case, which is not
         reflected in the foregoing financial statements or in the notes
         thereto. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.1(a), as of the Closing
         Date, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have no material liabilities
         (contingent or otherwise) that are not reflected in the foregoing
         financial statements or in the notes thereto.

                  (b) The financial statements delivered pursuant to Section
         7.1(a) and (b) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as
         may otherwise be permitted under Section 7.1(a) and (b)) and present
         fairly in all material respects (on the basis disclosed in the
         footnotes, if any, to such financial statements) the consolidated and
         consolidating financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
         of the Consolidated Parties as of such date and for such periods.

         6.2      NO MATERIAL CHANGE.

         Since June 30, 2001, there has been no development or event relating to
or affecting the Parent or any Consolidated Party which has had or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.3      ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.

validly existing and is in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, (b) has the corporate or other necessary
power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to
lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it
is currently engaged and (c) is duly qualified as a foreign entity and in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or
operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

necessary action to authorize the borrowings and other extensions of credit on
the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement and to authorize the

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or
at law).

         6.5      NO CONFLICTS.

         Neither the execution and delivery of the Credit Documents, nor the

compliance with the terms and provisions thereof by such Credit Party will (a)
violate or conflict with any provision of its articles or certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational or governing documents of such
Person, (b) violate, contravene or materially conflict with any material
Requirement of Law or any other law, regulation (including, without limitation,
Regulation U or Regulation X), order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or
permit applicable to it, (c) violate, contravene or conflict with contractual
provisions of, or cause an event of default under, any indenture, loan
agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, contract or other agreement or instrument to
which it is a party or by which it may be bound, the violation, contravention,
conflict or default of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, or (d) result in or require the creation of any Lien (other than
Permitted Liens) upon or with respect to its properties.

         6.6      NO DEFAULT.

         Neither the Parent nor any Consolidated Party is in default in any
respect under any contract, lease, loan agreement, indenture, mortgage, security
agreement or other agreement or obligation to which it is a party or by which
any of its properties is bound which default could have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred or exists except as
previously disclosed in writing to the Agent.

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each of the Parent and the
Consolidated Parties is the owner of, and has good and marketable title to, or a
valid leasehold interest in, all of its respective assets shown on the balance
sheet dated June 30, 2001 and all assets and properties acquired since the date

useful in the conduct of such Person's business or as have been disposed of in
the ordinary course of business or as otherwise permitted by this Credit
Agreement, and except for minor defects in title that do not interfere with the
ability of such Person to conduct its business as now conducted, and none of

         6.12     ERISA.

         Except as disclosed and described in Schedule 6.12 attached hereto:

                  (a) During the five-year period prior to the date on which
         this representation is made or deemed made: (i) no ERISA Event has
         occurred, and, to the best knowledge of the Executive Officers of the
         Credit Parties, no event or condition has occurred or exists as a
         result of which any ERISA Event could reasonably be expected to occur,
         with respect to any Plan; (ii) no "accumulated funding deficiency," as
         such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the
         Code, whether or not waived, has occurred with respect to any Plan;
         (iii) each Plan has been maintained, operated, and funded in compliance
         with its own terms and in material compliance with the provisions of
         ERISA, the Code, and any other applicable Federal or state laws; and
         (iv) no lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen or is reasonably
         likely to arise on account of any Plan.

                  (b) The actuarial present value of all "benefit liabilities"
         (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA), whether or not vested,
         under each Single Employer Plan, as of the last annual valuation date
         prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made
         (determined, in each case, in accordance with Financial Accounting
         Standards Board Statement 87, utilizing the actuarial assumptions used
         in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation report), did not exceed
         as of such valuation date the fair market value of the assets of such
         Plan.

                  (c) Neither the Parent, any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA
         Affiliate has incurred, or, to the best knowledge of the Executive
         Officers of the Credit Parties, could be reasonably expected to incur,
         any withdrawal liability under ERISA to any Multiemployer Plan or
         Multiple Employer Plan. Neither the Parent, any Consolidated Party nor
         any ERISA Affiliate would become subject to any withdrawal liability
         under ERISA if the Parent, any Consolidated Party or any ERISA
         Affiliate were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans and
         Multiple Employer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding
         the date on which this representation is made or deemed made. Neither
         the Parent, any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has received
         any notification that any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization
         (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), is insolvent (within the
         meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA), or has been terminated (within the
         meaning of Title IV of ERISA), and no Multiemployer Plan is, to the
         best knowledge of the Executive Officers of the Credit Parties,
         reasonably expected to be in reorganization, insolvent, or terminated.

                  (d) No prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section
         406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of fiduciary
         responsibility has occurred with respect to a Plan which has subjected
         or may subject the Parent, any Consolidated Party or any ERISA
         Affiliate to any liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l)
         of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or other
         instrument pursuant to which the Parent, any Consolidated Party or any
         ERISA Affiliate has agreed or is required to indemnify any Person
         against any such liability.

<PAGE>
                  (e) Neither the Parent, any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA
         Affiliates has any material liability with respect to "expected
         post-retirement benefit obligations" within the meaning of the
         Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106. Each Plan which is

         reasonable scope, form and depth, (including, where appropriate,
         invasive soil or groundwater sampling) by a consultant reasonably
         acceptable to the Agent as to the nature and extent of the presence of
         any Materials of Environmental Concern on any Real Properties (as
         defined in Section 6.16) and as to the compliance by the Parent, any
         Consolidated Party with Environmental Laws at such Real Properties. If
         the Credit Parties fail to deliver such an environmental report within
         seventy-five (75) days after receipt of such written request then the
         Agent may arrange for same, and the Credit Parties hereby grant to the
         Agent and their representatives access to the Real Properties to
         reasonably undertake such an assessment (including, where appropriate,
         invasive soil or groundwater sampling). The reasonable cost of any
         assessment arranged for by the Agent pursuant to this provision will be
         payable by the Credit Parties on demand and added to the obligations
         secured by the Collateral Documents.

                  (l) Additional Patents and Trademarks. At the time of delivery
         of the financial statements and reports provided for in Section 7.1(a),

         (i) a list of registration numbers for all patents, trademarks, service
         marks, tradenames and copyrights awarded to the Parent or any
         Consolidated Party since the last day of the immediately preceding
         fiscal year and (ii) a list of all patent applications, trademark
         applications, service mark applications, trade name applications and
         copyright applications submitted by the Parent or any Consolidated
         Party since the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and
         the status of each such application, all in such form as shall be
         reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

                  (m) Other Information. With reasonable promptness upon any
         such request, such other information regarding the business, properties
         or financial condition of the Parent or any Consolidated Party as the
         Agent may reasonably request.

         7.2      PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE AND FRANCHISES.

disposition of a Subsidiary not prohibited by Section 8.4 or Section 8.5, each
Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, do all things
necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, authority
and material rights and franchises.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
keep complete and accurate books and records of its transactions in accordance
with good accounting practices on the basis of GAAP (including the establishment
and maintenance of appropriate reserves).

         7.4      COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders, and all applicable
restrictions imposed by all Governmental Authorities, applicable to it and its
Property if noncompliance with any such law, rule, regulation, order or
restriction could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.5      PAYMENT OF TAXES AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay
and discharge (a) all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges or
levies imposed upon it, or upon its income or profits, or upon any of its
properties, before they shall become delinquent, (b) all lawful claims
(including claims for labor, materials and supplies) which, if unpaid, might
give rise to a Lien upon any of its properties, and (c) except as prohibited
hereunder, all of its other Indebtedness as it shall become due; provided,
however, that neither the Parent nor any Consolidated Party shall be required to
pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy, claim or Indebtedness which is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which adequate
reserves therefor have been established in accordance with GAAP, unless the
failure to make any such payment (i) could give rise to an immediate right to
foreclose on a Lien securing such amounts or (ii) could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.6      INSURANCE.

                  (a) Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its
         Subsidiaries to, at all times maintain in full force and effect
         insurance (including worker's compensation insurance, liability
         insurance, casualty insurance and business interruption insurance) in
         such amounts, covering such risks and liabilities and with such
         deductibles or self-insurance retentions as are in accordance with
         normal industry practice (or as otherwise required by the Collateral
         Documents). The Agent shall be named as loss payee or mortgagee, as its
         interest may appear, and/or additional insured with respect to any such
         insurance providing coverage in respect of any Collateral, and each
         provider of any such insurance shall agree, by endorsement upon the
         policy or policies issued by it or by independent instruments furnished
         to the Agent, that it will give the Agent thirty (30) days prior
         written notice before any such policy or policies shall be altered or
         canceled. The present insurance coverage of the Parent and the
         Consolidated Parties as of the Closing Date is outlined as to carrier,
         policy number, expiration date, type and amount on Schedule 7.6.

                  (b) In the event that the Parent or any of the Consolidated
         Parties receive Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $100,000 in aggregate
         amount during any fiscal year of the Parent and the Consolidated
         Parties ("Excess Proceeds") on account of any loss of, damage


                                       72
<PAGE>
         to or destruction of, or any condemnation or other taking for public
         use of, any Property of the Parent or the Consolidated Parties (with
         respect to the Parent or any Consolidated Party, an "Involuntary
         Disposition"), the Credit Parties shall, within the period of 360 days
         following the date of receipt of such Excess Proceeds, apply (or cause
         to be applied) an amount equal to such Excess Proceeds to (i) make
         Eligible Reinvestments (including but not limited to the repair or
         replacement of the related Property) or (ii) prepay the Loans (and cash
         collateralize LOC Obligations) in accordance with the terms of Section
         3.3(b)(ii)(B); provided, however, that such Person shall not undertake
         replacement or restoration of such Property unless, after giving pro
         forma effect to any Funded Indebtedness to be incurred in connection
         with such replacement or restoration, no Default or Event of Default
         would have occurred as of the most recent fiscal quarter end preceding
         the date of determination with respect to which the Agent has received
         the Required Financial Information (assuming, for purposes hereof, that
         such Funded Indebtedness was incurred as of the first day of the four
         fiscal-quarter period ending as of such fiscal quarter end). All
         insurance proceeds shall be subject to the security interest of the
         Agent (for the ratable benefit of the Lenders) under the Collateral
         Documents. Pending final application of any Excess Proceeds, the Credit
         Parties may apply such Excess Proceeds to temporarily reduce the
         Revolving Loans or to make Permitted Investments.

         7.7      MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
maintain and preserve its properties and equipment material to the conduct of
its business in good repair, working order and condition, normal wear and tear
and casualty and condemnation excepted, and will make, or cause to be made, in
such properties and equipment from time to time all repairs, renewals,
replacements, extensions, additions, betterments and improvements thereto as may
be needed or proper, to the extent and in the manner customary for companies in
similar businesses.

         7.8      PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
perform in all material respects all of its material obligations under the terms
of all material agreements, indentures, mortgages, security agreements or other
debt instruments to which it is a party or by which it is bound.

         7.9      USE OF PROCEEDS.

         The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loans and will use the

         Upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, each Credit
Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit representatives

agents, attorneys, and appraisers to visit and inspect its property, including
its books and records, its accounts receivable and inventory, its facilities and
its


                                       73
<PAGE>
other business assets, and to make photocopies or photographs thereof and to
write down and record any information such representative obtains and shall
permit the Agent or its representatives to investigate and verify the accuracy
of information provided to the Lenders and to discuss all such matters with the
officers, employees and representatives of such Person; provided, however, that,
unless an Event of Default shall be in existence, the Agent shall not exercise
it rights under this sentence more often than one time during any calendar year.
The Credit Parties agree that the Agent, and its representatives, may conduct an
annual audit of the Collateral, at the expense of the Credit Parties not to
exceed $10,000 per annum.

         Leverage Ratio as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of the
         Consolidated Parties to be greater than 2.00 to 1.00.

                  (b) Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The Credit Parties shall not
         permit the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as of the last day of any fiscal
         quarter of the Consolidated Parties to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.

         7.12     ADDITIONAL GUARANTORS.

         As soon as practicable and in any event within 30 days after any Person

acceptable to the Agent, (b) if such Person is a direct Foreign Subsidiary of a
Credit Party, cause 65% (or such greater percentage that, due to a change in an
applicable Requirement of Law after the date hereof, (i) could not reasonably be
expected to cause the undistributed earnings of such Foreign Subsidiary as
determined for United States federal income tax purposes to be treated as a

Foreign Subsidiary, such stock powers are deemed unnecessary by the Agent in its
reasonable discretion under the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of such
Person)) and pledged to the Agent pursuant to an appropriate pledge agreement(s)
in substantially the form of the Pledge Agreement and otherwise in form
acceptable to the Agent and (c) cause such Person to (i) if such Person is a
Domestic Subsidiary which has any real Property required by Section 7.13 to be
pledged to the Agent, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be

foregoing, including, without limitation, appropriate UCC-1 financing
statements, real estate title insurance policies, environmental reports,
landlord's waivers, certified resolutions and other organizational and
authorizing documents of such Person, favorable opinions of counsel to such

Excluded Property, and (ii) to the extent deemed to be material by the Agent or
the Requisite Lender in its or their sole reasonable discretion, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of its leased Property other than

secure the Credit Party Obligations pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Collateral Documents or, with respect to any such Property acquired subsequent
to the Closing Date, such other additional security documents as the Agent shall
reasonably request, subject in any case to Permitted Liens. In keeping with the
requirements of the preceding sentence, each Credit Party will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Agent, with respect to any
real Property acquired by such Person subsequent to the Closing Date and
required by this Section 7.13 to be pledged to the Agent, such real property

Foreign Subsidiary as determined for United States federal income tax purposes
to be treated as a deemed dividend to such Foreign Subsidiary's United States
parent and (ii) could not reasonably be expected to cause any material adverse
tax consequences) of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock entitled to vote

<PAGE>
         Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate to any liability under

         Credit Parties agree that upon receipt of such notice they will
         immediately pay) to the Agent additional cash, to be held by the Agent,
         for the benefit of the Lenders, in a cash collateral account as
         additional security for the LOC Obligations in respect of subsequent
         drawings under all then outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount
         equal to the maximum aggregate amount which may be drawn under all
         Letters of Credits then outstanding.

for all purposes hereof unless and until the Agent receives and accepts an
Assignment and Acceptance executed in accordance with Section 11.3(b) hereof. As
to any matters not expressly provided for by this Credit Agreement, the Agent
shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall
be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so
acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Requisite
Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding on all of the Lenders; provided,
however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes
the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to any Credit Document


                                       86

or applicable law or unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by
the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by
it by reason of taking any such action.

         10.3     DEFAULTS.

         The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Agent has received
written notice from a Lender or a Credit Party specifying such Default or Event
of Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event
that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Agent
shall (subject to Section 10.2 hereof) take such action with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably be directed by the Requisite
Lenders (or such other Lenders as required by Section 11.6), provided that,
unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem
advisable in the best interest of the Lenders.

         10.4     RIGHTS AS A LENDER.

         With respect to its Commitment and the Loans made by it, Bank of
America (and any successor acting as Agent) in its capacity as a Lender
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the Agent, and the
term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates,
include the Agent in its individual capacity. Bank of America (and any successor
acting as Agent) and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to
any Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to, make investments in, provide
services to, and generally engage in any kind of lending, trust, or other
business with any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as if it
were not acting as Agent, and Bank of America (and any successor acting as
Agent) and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from any
Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for services in connection
with this Credit Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same
to the Lenders.


                                       87
<PAGE>
         10.5     INDEMNIFICATION.

                  The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed under Section 11.5 hereof, but without limiting the obligations of
the Credit Parties under such Section) ratably (in accordance with their
respective Revolving Commitments (or, if the Revolving Commitments have been
terminated, the outstanding Revolving Loans and Participation Interests in
Letters of Credit (including the Participation Interests of the Issuing
Lender(s) in Letters of Credit))), for any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses
(including attorneys' fees), or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever
that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent (including by
any Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of any Credit Document or the
transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent
under any Credit Document; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of
the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Person to be indemnified. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs or expenses payable by the Credit Parties under Section 11.5,
to the extent that the Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and
expenses by the Credit Parties. The agreements in this Section 10.5 shall
survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under
the Credit Documents and the termination of the Commitments hereunder.

         10.6     NON-RELIANCE ON AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS.

         Each Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on
the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Credit Parties and
their Subsidiaries and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement and that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking
action under the Credit Documents. Except for financial statements, notices and
other information delivered to the Agent by any of the Credit Parties pursuant
to the terms of Section 7.1 (which the Agent shall be required to deliver to
each of the Lenders promptly following receipt thereof by the Agent) and except
for any other notices, reports, and other documents and information expressly
required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information concerning the affairs, financial condition, or business of
any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates that may come into the
possession of the Agent or any of its Affiliates.

         10.7     SUCCESSOR AGENT.

         The Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the
Lenders and the Credit Parties. Upon any such resignation, the Requisite Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent; provided that, unless an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time such appointment,
such successor Agent shall be approved by the Borrower (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Requisite Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of
resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the


                                       88
<PAGE>
Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States having combined capital and surplus of at
least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by
a successor, such successor shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring
Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 shall continue in effect for its
benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as Agent. If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by
the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Agent's notice of
resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon
become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Requisite Lenders appoint a successor
Agent as provided for above; provided that, unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing at the time such appointment, such successor Agent
shall be approved by the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).

         11.2     RIGHT OF SET-OFF; ADJUSTMENTS.

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and
other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender (or any of its Affiliates)
to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against any and all of
the obligations of such


                                       90
<PAGE>
Person now or hereafter existing under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes,
under any other Credit Document or otherwise, irrespective of whether such
Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or thereunder and although such
obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify any affected
Credit Party after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender under this
Section 11.2 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have.

         11.3     BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT.

                  (a) This Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
         the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and
         assigns of the parties hereto; provided that none of the Credit Parties
         may assign or transfer any of its interests and obligations without
         prior written consent of each of the Lenders; provided further that the
         rights of each Lender to transfer, assign or grant participations in
         its rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be limited as set forth
         in this Section 11.3.

                  (b) Each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees
         all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit
         Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its
         Loans, its Notes, and its Commitment); provided, however, that

                           (i) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible
                  Assignee;

                           (ii) except in the case of an assignment to another
                  Lender, an Affiliate of an existing Lender or any fund that
                  invests in bank loans and is advised or managed by an
                  investment advisor to an existing Lender or an assignment of
                  all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
                  Agreement, any such partial assignment shall be in an amount
                  at least equal to $2,500,000 (or, if less, the remaining
                  amount of the Commitment being assigned by such Lender) or an
                  integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;

                           (iii) [Reserved.]

                           (iv) the parties to such assignment shall execute and
                  deliver to the Agent for its acceptance an Assignment and
                  Acceptance in the form of Exhibit 11.3(b), together with any
                  Note subject to such assignment and a processing fee of
                  $3,500.

         Upon execution, delivery, and acceptance of such Assignment and
         Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
         extent of such assignment, have the obligations, rights, and benefits
         of a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of
         such assignment, relinquish its rights and be released from its
         obligations under this Credit Agreement. Upon the consummation of any
         assignment pursuant to this Section 11.3(b), the assignor, the Agent
         and the Credit Parties shall make appropriate arrangements so that as
         soon as practicable new Notes are issued to the assignor and the


                                       91
<PAGE>
         assignee. The assignee shall (to the extent required by Section 3.11)
         deliver to the Credit Parties and the Agent certification as to
         exemption from deduction or withholding of Taxes in accordance with
         Section 3.11.

                  (c) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
         Section 11.1 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
         accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and
         addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of
         the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The
         entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all
         purposes, absent manifest error, and the Credit Parties, the Agent and
         the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
         Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit
         Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Credit
         Parties or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
         reasonable prior notice. Any assignment of any Loan or other Credit
         Party Obligations shall be effective only upon an entry with respect
         thereto being made in the Register.

                  (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
         by the parties thereto, together with any Note subject to such
         assignment and payment of the processing fee, the Agent shall, if such
         Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially
         the form of Exhibit 11.3(b) hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and
         Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the
         Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the parties thereto.

                  (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more Persons
         in all or a portion of its rights, obligations or rights and
         obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of
         its Commitment or its Loans); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's
         obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)
         such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
         for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the participant shall be
         entitled to the benefit of the yield protection provisions contained in
         Sections 3.6, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 (but only to the extent
         that the selling Lender is so entitled) and (iv) the Credit Parties
         shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
         connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
         Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the
         obligations of the Credit Parties relating to the Credit Party
         Obligations owing to such Lender and to approve any amendment,
         modification, or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement
         (other than amendments, modifications, or waivers (A) decreasing the
         amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on such
         Loans or Notes, (B) extending any scheduled principal payment date or
         date fixed for the payment of interest on such Loans or Notes, (C)
         extending its Commitment, (D) except as the result of or in connection
         with an Asset Disposition not prohibited by Section 8.5, releasing all
         or substantially all of the Collateral or (E) except as the result of
         or in connection with a dissolution, merger or disposition of a
         Consolidated Party not prohibited by Section 8.4 or Section 8.5,
         releasing the Borrower or substantially all of the other Credit Parties
         from its or their obligations under the Credit Documents).


                                       92
<PAGE>
                  (f) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
         Credit Agreement, any Lender may at any time assign and pledge all or
         any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as
         collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular
         issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release
         the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

                  (g) Any Lender may furnish any information concerning the
         Parent or any of the Consolidated Parties in the possession of such
         Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including
         prospective assignees and participants), subject, however, to the
         provisions of Section 11.14 hereof.

         11.4     NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

         No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit
Document and no course of dealing between the Agent or any Lender and any of the
Credit Parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and
remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which the Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or
demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle the Credit Parties to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or
constitute a waiver of the rights of the Agent or the Lenders to any other or
further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

         11.5     EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to pay on
         demand all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent in connection
         with the syndication, preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
         modification, and amendment of this Credit Agreement, the other Credit
         Documents, and the other documents to be delivered hereunder,
         including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of
         counsel for the Agent with respect thereto and with respect to advising
         the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under the Credit
         Documents. The Credit Parties further jointly and severally agree to
         pay on demand all costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if
         any (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees of a
         single counsel for the Agent and the Lenders), in connection with the
         enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or
         otherwise) of the Credit Documents and the other documents to be
         delivered hereunder.

                  (b) The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to
         indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and each Lender and each of their
         Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
         and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and
         all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses
         (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be
         incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in
         each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of
         (including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation,


                                       93
<PAGE>
         litigation, or proceeding or preparation of defense in connection
         therewith) the Credit Documents, any of the transactions contemplated
         herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans,
         except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability, cost, or
         expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
         competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's
         gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of an
         investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in
         this Section 11.5 applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or
         not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any of
         the Credit Parties, their respective directors, shareholders or
         creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any
         Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the
         transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Credit Parties
         agree not to assert any claim against the Agent, any Lender, any of
         their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers,
         employees, attorneys, agents, and advisers, on any theory of liability,
         for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising out
         of or otherwise relating to the Credit Documents, any of the
         transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the
         proceeds of the Loans.

                  (c) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
         of the Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the

                  Neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document

termination is in writing entered into by, or approved in writing by, each of
the Credit Parties party thereto and the Requisite Lenders, provided, however,
that:

                  (a) without the written consent of each Lender affected
         thereby, neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document
         may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or terminated so as to

                           (i) extend the final maturity of any Loan or of any

<PAGE>
                           (iv) increase the Commitment of a Lender over the
                  amount thereof in effect (it being understood and agreed that
                  a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or mandatory
                  reduction in the Commitments shall not constitute a change in
                  the terms of any Commitment of any Lender),

                           (v) except as the result of or in connection with an
                  Asset Disposition not prohibited by Section 8.5, release all

                  or substantially all of the other Credit Parties from its or
                  their obligations under the Credit Documents,

                           (vii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this
                  Section 11.6,

                           (viii) reduce any percentage specified in, or
                  otherwise modify, the definition of Requisite Lenders, or

                           (ix) consent to the assignment or transfer by the
                  Borrower or all or substantially all of the other Credit
                  Parties of any of its or their rights and obligations under
                  (or in respect of) the Credit Documents except as permitted
                  thereby;

                  (b) without the written consent of the Agent, no provision of
         Section 10 or any other provision of any Credit Agreement pertaining to
         the duties and responsibilities of the Agent may be amended, changed,
         waived, discharged or terminated;

         terminated; or

                  (d) without the written consent of the Swingline Lender, no
         provision of Section 2.3 may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or
         terminated.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent
provisions set forth herein and (y) the Requisite Lenders shall determine
whether or not to allow a Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of
a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding and such determination shall be binding on
all of the Lenders.

         11.7     COUNTERPARTS.

         This Credit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary in
making proof of this Credit Agreement to produce or


                                       95
<PAGE>
account for more than one such counterpart for each of the parties hereto.
Delivery by facsimile by any of the parties hereto of an executed counterpart of
this Credit Agreement shall be as effective as an original executed counterpart
hereof and shall be deemed a representation that an original executed
counterpart hereof will be delivered.

         11.8     HEADINGS.

         The headings of the sections hereof are provided for convenience only
and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of
this Credit Agreement.

         11.9     SURVIVAL.

         All indemnities set forth herein, including, without limitation, in
Section 2.2(i), 3.11, 3.12, 10.5 or 11.5 shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Credit Agreement, the making of the Loans, the issuance of the
Letters of Credit, the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and other
obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination of the Commitments
hereunder, and all representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties
herein shall survive until this Credit Agreement shall be terminated in
accordance with the terms of Section 11.13(b).

         11.10    GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE.

                  (a) THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY
         PROVIDED THEREIN, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND
         OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED
         BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
         STATE OF NEW YORK. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
         Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document may be brought in the
         courts of the State of New York, or of the United States for the
         Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this
         Credit Agreement, each of the Credit Parties hereby irrevocably accepts
         for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
         unconditionally, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Each of
         the Credit Parties further irrevocably consents to the service of
         process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or
         proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified
         mail, postage prepaid, to it at the address set out for notices
         pursuant to Section 11.1, such service to become effective three (3)
         days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the
         Agent or any Lender to serve process in any other manner permitted by
         law or to commence legal proceedings or to otherwise proceed against
         any Credit Party in any other jurisdiction.

                  (b) Each of the Credit Parties hereby irrevocably waives any
         objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
         any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in
         connection with this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
         brought in the courts referred to in clause (a) above and hereby
         further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such
         court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has
         been brought in an inconvenient forum.


                                       96
<PAGE>
                  (c) TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF THE AGENT, THE
         LENDERS (INCLUDING THE ISSUING LENDER AND THE SWINGLINE LENDER), EACH
         OF THE CREDIT PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
         JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
         RELATING TO THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR
         THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         11.11    SEVERABILITY.

         If any provision of any of the Credit Documents is determined to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable and
the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be
construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions.

         11.12    ENTIRETY.

         This Credit Agreement together with the other Credit Documents
represent the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any, including any
commitment letters or correspondence relating to the Credit Documents or the
transactions contemplated herein and therein.

         11.13    BINDING EFFECT; TERMINATION.

                  (a) This Credit Agreement shall become effective at such time
         on or after the Closing Date upon satisfaction of all of the conditions
         in Section 5.1 and when it shall have been executed by each Credit
         Party and the Agent, and the Agent shall have received copies hereof
         (telefaxed or otherwise) which, when taken together, bear the
         signatures of each Lender, and thereafter this Credit Agreement shall
         be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Credit Party, the
         Agent and each Lender (including the Issuing Lender(s) and the
         Swingline Lender) and their respective successors and assigns.

                  (b) The term of this Credit Agreement shall be until the
         Credit Party Obligations are Fully Satisfied.

                  (c) At such time as this Credit Agreement shall have become
         effective pursuant to the terms of Section 11.13(a) and Section 5.1,
         the promissory notes executed in connection with the Existing Credit
         Agreement shall be replaced with the Notes, if any, executed in
         connection with this Credit Agreement.

                  (d) The Agent and the Lenders acknowledge and agree (i) that
         the Acquisition Loans and the Term Loans (as such terms are defined
         under the Existing Credit Agreement) have been paid in full in cash and
         terminated on the Closing Date and (ii) to return any note(s)
         evidencing the Acquisition Loans or the Term Loans to the Borrower
         promptly after the Closing Date for cancellation.


                                       97
<PAGE>
                  (e) The Agent and the Lenders consent to the repayment in full
         in cash on the Closing Date of the Subordinated Note Agreement (as
         defined under the Existing Credit Agreement).

         11.14    CONFIDENTIALITY.

         The Agent and each Lender (each, a "Lending Party") agrees to keep
confidential (and to use reasonable efforts to cause their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives to keep confidential) any
information, materials and documents furnished or made available to it by or on
behalf of the Credit Parties pursuant to this Credit Agreement; provided that
nothing herein shall prevent any Lending Party from disclosing such information
(a) to any other Lending Party or any Affiliate of any Lending Party, or any
officer, director, employee, agent, or advisor of any Lending Party or Affiliate
of any Lending Party or to any other Person if reasonably incidental to the
administration of the Credit Facility, in each case, on a need to know basis in
accordance with customary banking practices and who receive such information
having been made aware of the restrictions of this Section 11.14, (b) as
required by any law, rule, or regulation, (c) upon the order of any court or
administrative agency, (d) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency
or authority, (e) that is or becomes available to the public or that is or
becomes available to any Lending Party other than as a result of a disclosure by
any Lending Party prohibited by this Credit Agreement, (f) in connection with
any litigation to which such Lending Party or any of its Affiliates may be a
party, (g) to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise of any remedy
under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, (h) to the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization or any
nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a
Lender's investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to
such Lender, (i) to any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap
agreements or such contractual counterparty's professional advisor (so long as
such contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual
counterparty (i) has been approved in writing by the Borrower and (ii) agrees in
a writing enforceable by the Borrower to be bound by the provisions of this
Section 11.14) and (j) subject to provisions substantially similar to those
contained in this Section 11.14, to any actual or proposed participant or
assignee; provided, however, that with respect to clauses (b), (c), (d), (f) and
(h), the Agent or such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, use reasonable
efforts to give notice to the Borrower of the release of such information.

         11.15    SOURCE OF FUNDS.

         Each of the Lenders hereby represents and warrants to the Borrower that
at least one of the following statements is an accurate representation as to the
source of funds to be used by such Lender in connection with the financing
hereunder:

                  (a) no part of such funds constitutes assets allocated to any
         separate account maintained by such Lender in which any employee
         benefit plan (or its related trust) has any interest;


                                       98
<PAGE>
                  (b) to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes
         assets allocated to any separate account maintained by such Lender,
         such Lender has disclosed to the Borrower the name of each employee
         benefit plan whose assets in such account exceed 10% of the total
         assets of such account as of the date of such purchase (and, for
         purposes of this clause (b), all employee benefit plans maintained by
         the same employer or employee organization are deemed to be a single
         plan);

                  (c) to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes
         assets of an insurance company's general account, such insurance
         company has complied with all of the requirements of the regulations
         issued under Section 401(c)(1)(A) of ERISA such that the assets of such
         general account do not constitute assets of an employee benefit plan;
         or

                  (d) such funds constitute assets of one or more specific
         benefit plans which such Lender has identified in writing to the
         Borrower.

As used in this Section 11.15, the terms "employee benefit plan" and "separate
account" shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in Section 3
of ERISA.

         11.16    REGULATION D.

         Each of the Lenders hereby represents and warrants to the Borrower that
it is a commercial lender, other financial institution or other "accredited"
investor (as defined in SEC Regulation D) which makes or acquires or loans on
the ordinary course of business and that it will make or acquire Loans for its
own account in the ordinary course of business.

         11.17    CONFLICT.

         To the extent that there is a conflict or inconsistency between any
provision hereof, on the one hand, and any provision of any Credit Document, on
the other hand, this Credit Agreement shall control.
