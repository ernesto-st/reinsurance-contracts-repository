Section 1.5 Interest Rates; LIBORBenchmark Notification.  The interest rate on Eurodollar  Loans is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, which is derived from the London interbank  offered rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;).  LIBOR is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may  obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market.  On March 5, 2021,  the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;) publicly announced that: (a) immediately after  December 31, 2021, publication of the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will  permanently cease; (b) immediately after June 30, 2023, publication of the overnight and 12-month  U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; and (c) immediately after June 30, 2023, the 1- month, 3-month and 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or, subject to the  FCA&#8217;s consideration of the case, be provided on a changed methodology (or &#8220;synthetic&#8221;) basis and  no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to  measure and that representativeness will not be restored.  There is no assurance that dates announced  by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take  further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the  currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published.  Each party to this agreement should consult  its own advisors to stay informed of any such developments. Public and private sector industry  initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place  of LIBORa Loan denominated in Dollars may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may  be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform.  Upon the  occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in  Election, Section 3.4(b) and Section 3.4(c) provide theprovides a mechanism for determining an  alternative rate of interest.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to  Section 3.4(e), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans  is based.  However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall  not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter  related to LIBOR or other rates in the definition of &#8220;LIBO Rate&#8221;any interest rate used in this Credit  Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented  pursuant to Section 3.4(b) or Section 3.4(c), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition  Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the implementation of  any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 3.4(d)),, including without  limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement  reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO  Rateexisting interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London  interbank offeredany existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.

(a) Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its  agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers  as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as  are reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the  Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Company nor any other Borrower shall have rights  as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term  &#8220;agent&#8221; as used herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any similar term) with reference to the  Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations  arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used as a matter of market  custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent  contracting parties.  (b) The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same  rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it  were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money  to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate  thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  (c) The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those  expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Administrative Agent  shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred  and is continuing, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or  exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the  Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders  (or such other number or percentage of the Credit Parties as shall be necessary under the circumstances as  provided in Section 10.2), and (iii) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not  have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any  Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as  Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable  for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such  other number or percentage of the Credit Parties as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided  in Section 10.2) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a  final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Administrative Agent shall be  deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof  (stating that it is a &#8220;notice of Default&#8221; or a &#8220;notice of an Event of Default&#8221;) is given to the Administrative  Agent by a Borrower or a Credit Party.  Further, the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or  have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in  connection with this Credit Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document  delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants,  agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of  Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Credit Agreement or any other  agreement, instrument or document (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the  Administrative Agent&#8217;s reliance on any Electronic Signature transmitted by telecopy, emailed pdf, or any  other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), or (v) the satisfaction  </FONT></DIV>

(d) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any  liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other  writing reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The  Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by  it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative  Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants  and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance  with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  (e) The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights  and powers by or through any Affiliate or, upon prior notice to the Company (provided that such notice  shall not be required during the continuance of an Event of Default), any one or more sub agents appointed  by the Administrative Agent, provided that no such delegation shall serve as a release of the Administrative  Agent or waiver by any Borrower of any rights hereunder.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub  agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related  Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub agent and to  the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective  activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities  as Administrative Agent.  (f) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as  provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Credit Parties  and the Company.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation  with the Company, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required  Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent  gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Credit Parties,  appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York City, or an  Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by  a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and  duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from  its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Company or any Borrower to a successor  Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between  the Company or such Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation  hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.3 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such  retiring Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.  (g) Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that the extensions of credit made  hereunder are commercial loans and not investments in a business enterprise or securities.  Each Credit  Party acknowledges that it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary  course of its business and it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any  Arranger or any other Credit Party and their respective Related Parties and based on such documents and  information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Credit  Agreement.  Each Credit Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the  Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party and based on such documents and information (which may  contain material, non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning  the Borrowers and their Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own  decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon any Loan Document, any related agreement or  </FONT></DIV>
