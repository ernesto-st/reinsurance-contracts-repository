                                   ARTICLE I.
                  MEDICARE VOLUNTARY PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT

A.   PDP Sponsor agrees to operate one or more Medicare Voluntary Prescription
     Drug Plans (hereinafter referred to as a "PDP"), as described in its
     application and related materials, including but not limited to all the
     attestations contained therein and all supplemental guidance, for Medicare
     approval and in compliance with the provisions of this contract, which
     incorporates in its entirety the Solicitation For Applications from
     Prescription Drug Plans released on January 21, 2005 (as revised on March
     9, 2005) (hereinafter collectively referred to as "the contract"). The PDP
     Sponsor also agrees to operate in accordance with the regulations at 42 CFR
     Section 423.1 through 42 CFR Section 423.910 (with the exception of
     Subparts Q, R and S), sections 1860D-1 through 1860D-42 (with the exception
     of sections 1860D-22(a) and 1860D-31) of the Social Security Act, and the
     solicitation, as well as all other applicable Federal statutes, regulations
     and policies. This contract is deemed to incorporate any changes that are
     required by statute to be implemented during the term of this contract and
     any regulations or policies implementing or interpreting such statutory
     provisions.

B.   CMS agrees to perform its obligations to the PDP Sponsor consistent with

     exception of sections 1860D-22(a) and 1860D-31) and the solicitation, as
     well as all other applicable Federal statutes, regulations and policies.

C.   CMS agrees that it will not implement, other than at the beginning of a

     423. Failure to reference a regulatory requirement in this contract does
     not affect the applicability of such requirements to the PDP Sponsor and
     CMS.

          waiver granted pursuant to 42 CFR Section 423.410, such waiver shall
          be valid for three consecutive program years. PDP Sponsor agrees that
          expiration of the licensure waiver (and the failure to obtain a

          from the PDP Sponsor's service area those PDP Regions affected by the
          waiver expiration. CMS may terminate or non-renew the PDP Sponsor's
          contract where the expiration of the waiver results in the PDP Sponsor

          waiver granted pursuant to 42 CFR Section 423.415, such waiver shall

          and Human Services determines is appropriate for timely processing of
          the PDP Sponsor's license application by the State, but in no case no
          more than one year only, beginning on January 1 of the contract year
          for which CMS granted the waiver.

          information and belief to CMS of any integrity items related to
          payments from governmental entities, both federal and state, for
          healthcare or prescription drug services that would have been reported
