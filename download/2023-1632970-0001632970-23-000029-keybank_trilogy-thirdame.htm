The proceeds of such A/R Revolving Loan or Real Estate Revolving Loan, as applicable, shall be immediately applied to repay the applicable Swing Loans. (e) If for any reason a Swing Loan cannot be refinanced by an A/R Revolving Loan or a Real Estate Revolving Loan, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.4(d) or if such Swing Loan was 58 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 made pursuant to Section 2.4(h), each A/R Revolving Loan Lender or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender, as applicable, will, on the date such A/R Revolving Loan or Real Estate Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.4(d) was to have been made (or automatically and without any action on the part of the Swing Loan Lender, if such Swing Loan was made pursuant to Section 2.4(h) or any of the events described in any of the events described in Section 12.1(h), 12.1(i) or 12.1(j) shall have occurred), purchase an undivided participation interest in the Swing Loan in an amount equal to its A/R Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage or Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage, as applicable, of such Swing Loan.  Each A/R Revolving Loan Lender or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender, as applicable, will immediately transfer to the Swing Loan Lender in immediately available funds the amount of its participation and upon receipt thereof the Swing Loan Lender will deliver to such A/R Revolving Loan Lender or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender, as applicable, a Swing Loan participation certificate dated the date of receipt of such funds and in such amount. (f) Whenever at any time after the Swing Loan Lender has received from any A/R Revolving Loan Lender or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender, as applicable, such A/R Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s participation interest in a Swing Loan, the Swing Loan Lender receives any payment on account thereof, the Swing Loan Lender will distribute to such A/R Revolving Loan Lender or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender its participation interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted in the case of interest payments to reflect the period of time during which such A/R Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s participating interest was outstanding and funded); provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by the Swing Loan Lender is required to be returned, such A/R Revolving Loan Lender or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender will return to the Swing Loan Lender any portion thereof previously distributed by the Swing Loan Lender to it. (g) Each A/R Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s obligation to fund an A/R Revolving Loan and Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s obligation to fund a Real Estate Revolving Loan as provided in Section 2.4(d) or to purchase participation interests pursuant to Section 2.4(e) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (a) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such A/R Revolving Loan Lender or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender or any Borrower may have against the Swing Loan Lender, any Borrower or anyone else for any reason whatsoever; (b) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default; (c) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of any Loan Party or any of their Subsidiaries; (d) any breach of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents by any Loan Party or any Lender; or (e) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.  Any portions of a Swing Loan not so purchased or converted may be treated by Administrative Agent and the Swing Loan Lender as against such applicable A/R Revolving Loan Lender as an A/R Revolving Loan or against such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender as a Real Estate Revolving Loan which was not funded by the non-purchasing A/R Revolving Loan Lender or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender, thereby making such A/R Revolving Loan Lender or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender, as applicable, a Defaulting Lender.  Each Swing Loan, once so sold or converted, shall cease to be a Swing Loan for the purposes of this Agreement, but shall be an A/R Revolving Loan made by such A/R Revolving Loan Lender under its A/R Revolving Loan Commitment or a Real Estate Revolving Loan made by each Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender under its Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment, as applicable. (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other contrary provision of this Agreement, the Lenders hereby authorize the Swing Loan Lender, at the direction of Administrative Agent in Administrative Agent&#8217;s reasonable discretion, and Swing Loan Lender shall, at the direction of Administrative Agent, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make Real Estate Swing Loans to Borrowers, notwithstanding that the Aggregate Real Estate Revolving Credit Obligations (after giving 59 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

The foregoing sentence is for the exclusive benefit of Administrative Agent, the Swing Loan Lender, and the Lenders and is not intended to benefit Borrowers in any way.  The Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders may at any time revoke Administrative Agent&#8217;s authority to direct the Swing Loan Lender to make Real Estate Swing Loans pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 2.4(h).  Any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon Administrative Agent&#8217;s receipt thereof. (i) The obligations of Borrowers to the A/R Revolving Loan Lenders and the Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders under this Agreement with respect to Swing Loans (and of the A/R Revolving Loan Lenders and the Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders to make payments to the Swing Loan Lender with respect to Swing Loans) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under all circumstances whatsoever, including the following circumstances:  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or any right which any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates may have at any time against any Lender (other than the defense of payment to the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) or any other person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents; (iv) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; and (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

(b) Subject to Section 4.11, each LIBOR Rate(i) Daily Simple SOFR Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with (and including) the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on (and excluding, with respect to repayment, if such repayment is received by Administrative Agent no later than 2:00 pm as required by Section 4.3(a)) the last day of each Interest Period with respect thereto or, if earlier, the date on which such LIBOR Rate Loan is repaid or converted to a Base Rate Loan,the date on which such Daily Simple SOFR Loan is repaid or is converted to a Loan of another Type at the rate per annum equal to the sum of Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus the Applicable Margin for SOFR Rate Loans, and (ii) Term SOFR Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of each Interest Period with respect thereto at the rate per annum equal to the sum of LIBORAdjusted Term SOFR determined for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for SOFR Rate Loans. 60 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 (c) Borrowers promise to pay interest on each Loan in arrears on each Interest Payment Date with respect thereto. (d) Base Rate Loans and LIBORSOFR Rate Loans may be converted to Loans of the other Type as provided in Section 4.1. Section 2.6 Requests for Loans.  Parent, on behalf of the applicable Borrowers, shall give to Administrative Agent written notice executed by an Authorized Officer of Parent in the form of Exhibit F (or telephonic notice confirmed in writing in the form of Exhibit F) of each Loan requested hereunder (a &#8220;Loan Request&#8221;) by 11:00 a.m. (X) one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed Drawdown Date with respect to Base Rate Loans and, (Y) on the same Business Day as the proposed Drawdown Date with respect to Daily Simple SOFR Loans, or (Z) three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed Drawdown Date with respect to LIBOR RateTerm SOFR Loans.  Each such notice shall specify with respect to the requested Loan the proposed principal amount of such Loan, whether the Loan is a Real Estate Revolving Loan or an A/R Revolving Loan, the Type of Loan, the initial Interest Period (if applicable) for such Loan and the Drawdown Date.  Each such notice shall also contain (a) a statement that the proceeds of such Loan shall be used in accordance with the terms of Section 2.8 and (b) a certification by the chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer or treasurer or controller of Parent that the Loan Parties are and will be in compliance with all covenants under the Loan Documents after giving effect to the making of such Loan.  Promptly upon receipt of any such notice, Administrative Agent shall notify each of the applicable Lenders thereof.  Each such Loan Request shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrowers and shall obligate Borrowers to accept the Loan requested from the applicable Lenders on the proposed Drawdown Date.  Nothing herein shall prevent Borrowers from seeking recourse against any Lender that fails to advance its proportionate share of a requested Loan as required by this Agreement.  Each Loan Request shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $500,000.00 or an integral multiple of $100,000.00 in excess thereof; provided, however, that there shall be no more than ten (10) LIBORSOFR Rate Loans outstanding at any one time.  At Revolving Agent&#8217;s reasonable request, Administrative Agent shall provide information with respect to A/R Revolving Loan balances. Section 2.7 Funds for Loans. (a) Not later than (i) the time specified by Administrative Agent to the Lenders with respect to the initial advance of the Loans on the Closing Date, and (ii) 1:00 p.m. on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Loans, each of the applicable Lenders will make available to Administrative Agent, at Administrative Agent&#8217;s Head Office, in immediately available funds, the amount of such Lender&#8217;s A/R Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage or Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage, as applicable, of the amount of the requested Loans which may be disbursed pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2.  Upon receipt from each such Lender of such amount, and upon receipt of the documents required by Sections 10 and 11 and the satisfaction of the other conditions set forth therein, to the extent applicable, Administrative Agent will make available to Borrowers the aggregate amount of such Loans made available to Administrative Agent by the applicable Lenders by crediting such amount to the account of Borrowers maintained at Administrative Agent&#8217;s Head Office or wiring such funds in accordance with Borrowers&#8217; written instructions.  The failure or refusal of any Lender to make available to Administrative Agent at the aforesaid time and place on any Drawdown Date the amount of its Commitment Percentage of the requested Loans shall not relieve any other Lender from its several obligation hereunder to make available to Administrative Agent the amount of such other Lender&#8217;s Commitment Percentage of any requested Loans, including any additional A/R Revolving Loans or Real Estate Revolving Loans that may be requested subject to the terms and conditions hereof to provide funds to replace those not advanced by the Lender so failing or refusing. 61 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 (b) Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the applicable Drawdown Date that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s Commitment Percentage of a proposed Loan, Administrative Agent may in its discretion assume that such Lender has made such Loan available to Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and Administrative Agent may, if it chooses, in reliance upon such assumption make such Loan available to Borrowers, and such Lender shall be liable to Administrative Agent for the amount of such advance.  If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount upon Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor, Administrative Agent will promptly notify Parent, and Borrowers shall promptly pay such corresponding amount to Administrative Agent.  Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or Borrowers, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by Administrative Agent to Borrowers to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i) from Borrowers at the applicable rate for such Loan or (ii) from a Lender at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. Section 2.8 Use of Proceeds.  Borrowers will use (a)  the proceeds of Real Estate Revolving Loans available pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of Real Estate Borrowing Base Availability only as expressly permitted by such clause (b), and (b) the proceeds of all other Loans for acquisitions, debt repayment, general corporate and working capital purposes, including Construction Costs for Eligible Villa Units, Investments permitted under Section 8.3 and Permitted Distributions, in each case to the extent otherwise consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Section 2.9 Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at any time and from time to time from the Closing Date through the day that is ninety (90) days prior to the Maturity Date, the Issuing Lender shall issue such Letters of Credit as Borrowers may request upon the delivery of a written request in the form of Exhibit G (a &#8220;Letter of Credit Request&#8221;) to the Issuing Lender, provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) upon issuance of such Letter of Credit, the aggregate Letter of Credit Liabilities shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment, (iii) in no event shall the Aggregate Real Estate Revolving Credit Obligations (after giving effect to any requested Letters of Credit) exceed the lesser of the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment and the Real Estate Borrowing Base Availability or cause a violation of the covenant set forth in Section 9.1, (iv) the conditions set forth in Sections 10 and 11 shall have been satisfied, and (v) in no event shall any amount drawn under a Letter of Credit be available for reinstatement or a subsequent drawing under such Letter of Credit.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.9, the Issuing Lender shall not be obligated to issue, amend, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit at a time when any other Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender is a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Lender is satisfied that the participation therein will otherwise be fully allocated to the Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders that are Non-Defaulting Lenders consistent with Section 2.12(c) and the Defaulting Lender shall have no participation therein, except to the extent the Issuing Lender has entered into arrangements with Borrowers or such Defaulting Lender which are satisfactory to the Issuing Lender in its good faith determination to eliminate the Issuing Lender&#8217;s Fronting Exposure with respect to any such Defaulting Lender, including the delivery of cash collateral.  The Issuing Lender may assume that the conditions in Sections 10 and 11 have been satisfied unless it receives written notice from a Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender that such conditions have not been satisfied.  Each Letter of Credit Request shall be executed by an Authorized Officer of Parent.  The Issuing Lender shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Person&#8217;s authority to request a Letter of Credit on behalf of Borrowers.  The Issuing Lender shall have no duty to verify the authenticity of any signature appearing on a Letter of Credit Request.  Each Borrower assumes all risks with respect to the use of the Letters of Credit.  Unless the Issuing Lender and the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders otherwise 62 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 consent, the term of any Letter of Credit shall not exceed a period of time commencing on the issuance of the Letter of Credit and ending one (1) year after the date of issuance thereof, subject to extension pursuant to an &#8220;evergreen&#8221; clause acceptable to Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender (but in any event the term shall not extend beyond five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date).  The amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the amount available to be drawn under the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment as a Real Estate Revolving Loan. (b) Each Letter of Credit Request shall be submitted to the Issuing Lender at least five (5) Business Days (or such shorter period as the Issuing Lender may approve) prior to the date upon which the requested Letter of Credit is to be issued.  Each such Letter of Credit Request shall contain (i) a statement as to the purpose for which such Letter of Credit shall be used (which purpose shall be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) a certification by the chief financial officer of Parent that the Loan Parties are and will be in compliance with all covenants under the Loan Documents after giving effect to the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  Borrowers shall further deliver to the Issuing Lender such additional applications (the form of application as of the date hereof being attached hereto as Exhibit H) and documents as the Issuing Lender may require, in conformity with the then standard practices of its letter of credit department, in connection with the issuance of such Letter of Credit; provided that in the event of any conflict, the terms of this Agreement shall control. (c) The Issuing Lender shall, subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, issue the Letter of Credit on or before five (5) Business Days following receipt of the documents last due pursuant to Section 2.9(b).  Each Letter of Credit shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Lender in its reasonable discretion. (d) Upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit, each Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender shall be deemed to have purchased a participation therein from the Issuing Lender in an amount equal to its respective Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage of the amount of such Letter of Credit.  No Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s obligation to participate in a Letter of Credit shall be affected by any other Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s failure to perform as required herein with respect to such Letter of Credit or any other Letter of Credit. (e) Upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall pay to the Issuing Lender (i) for its own account, a Letter of Credit fronting fee calculated at the rate equal to one-eighth of one percent (0.125%) of the face amount of such Letter of Credit (which fee shall not be less than $1,500 in any event) and an administrative charge of $250, and (ii) for the accounts of the Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders that are Non-Defaulting Lenders (including the Issuing Lender) in accordance with their respective percentage shares of participation in such Letter of Credit, a Letter of Credit fee calculated at the rate per annum equal to the sum of Adjusted Term SOFR plus Applicable Margin then applicable to LIBORSOFR Rate Loans on the face amount of such Letter of Credit.  Such fees shall be payable in quarterly installments in arrears with respect to each Letter of Credit on the first day of each calendar quarter following the date of issuance and continuing on each quarter or portion thereof thereafter, as applicable, or on any earlier date on which the Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitments shall terminate and on the expiration or return of any Letter of Credit.  In addition, Borrowers shall pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account within five (5) days of demand of the Issuing Lender the standard issuance, documentation and service charges for Letters of Credit issued from time to time by the Issuing Lender. (f) In the event that any amount is drawn under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, Borrowers shall reimburse the Issuing Lender by having such amount drawn treated as an outstanding Real Estate Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan under this Agreement (Borrowers being deemed to have requested a Base Rate Loan on such date in an amount equal to the amount of such 63 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

If and to the extent any Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender shall not make such amount available on the Business Day on which such draw is funded, such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender agrees to pay such amount to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date on which such draw was funded until the date on which such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate until three (3) days after the date on which Administrative Agent gives notice of such draw and at the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus one percent (1%) for each day thereafter.  Further, such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Real Estate Revolving Loans, amounts due with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit and any other amounts due to it hereunder to Administrative Agent to fund the amount of any drawn Letter of Credit which such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender was required to fund pursuant to this Section 2.9(f) until such amount has been funded (as a result of such assignment or otherwise).  In the event of any such failure or refusal, the Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders not so failing or refusing shall be entitled to a priority secured position for such amounts as provided in Section 3.6.  The failure of any Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender to make funds available to Administrative Agent in such amount shall not relieve any other Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender of its obligation hereunder to make funds available to Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.9(f). (g) If after the issuance of a Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.9(c) by the Issuing Lender, but prior to the funding of any portion thereof by a Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender, for any reason a drawing under a Letter of Credit cannot be refinanced as an Real Estate Revolving Loan, each Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender will, on the date such Real Estate Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.9(f) was to have been made, purchase an undivided participation interest in the Letter of Credit in an amount equal to its Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage of the amount of such Letter of Credit.  Each Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender will immediately transfer to the Issuing Lender in immediately available funds the amount of its participation and upon receipt thereof the Issuing Lender will deliver to such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender a Letter of Credit participation certificate dated the date of receipt of such funds and in such amount. (h) Whenever at any time after the Issuing Lender has received from any Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender any such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s payment of funds under a Letter of Credit and thereafter the Issuing Lender receives any payment on account thereof, then the Issuing Lender will distribute to such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender its participation interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted in the case of interest payments to reflect the period of time during which such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s participation interest was outstanding and funded); provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by the Issuing Lender is required to be returned, such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender will return to the Issuing Lender any portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it. (i) The issuance of any supplement, modification, amendment, renewal or extension to or of any Letter of Credit shall be treated in all respects the same as the issuance of a new Letter of Credit. (j) Each Borrower assumes all risks of the acts, omissions, or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof.  Neither Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender nor any Real 64 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Estate Revolving Loan Lender will be responsible for (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any Letter of Credit or any document submitted by any party in connection with the issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if such document should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to comply fully with the conditions required in order to demand payment under a Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document or draft required by or from a beneficiary in order to make a disbursement under a Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof; (vii) for the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; and (viii) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of Administrative Agent or any Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender.  None of the foregoing will affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of the rights or powers granted to Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders hereunder.  In furtherance and extension and not in limitation or derogation of any of the foregoing, any act taken or omitted to be taken by Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the other Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders in good faith will be binding on Borrowers and will not put Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the other Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders under any resulting liability to Borrowers; provided nothing contained herein shall relieve the Issuing Lender for liability to Borrowers arising as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction after the exhaustion of all applicable appeal periods. Section 2.10 Increase in Commitments. (a) Provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.10 and with the approval of Administrative Agent, Borrowers shall have the option, at any time and from time to time, before the Maturity Date to request the increase of the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or the increase of the Total A/R Revolving Loan Commitment (each, a &#8220;Commitment Increase&#8221;), in an aggregate amount not to exceed $140,000,000.00100,000,000.00 (such that the Total Commitment shall not exceed $500,000,000.00), by giving written notice to Administrative Agent (each, an &#8220;Increase Notice&#8221;), each of which shall specify the date (each, an &#8220;Increase Effective Date&#8221;) on which Borrowers propose that the applicable Commitment Increase shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to Administrative Agent, and the Commitment to be increased; provided that any such individual increase of the Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or the A/R Revolving Loan Commitment must be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000.00 and increments of $5,000,000.00 in excess thereof unless otherwise approved by Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. Upon receipt of any Increase Notice, Administrative Agent shall consult with KeyBanc and shall notify Parent of the amount of the facility fees to be paid to any Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders or A/R Revolving Loan Lenders, as the case may be, who provide a portion of the Commitment Increase pursuant to such Increase Notice in connection with such increase in the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or Total A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be (which shall be in addition to the fees to be paid to Administrative Agent and KeyBanc pursuant to the Administrative Agent Fee Letter). If Borrowers agree to pay the facility fees so determined, Administrative Agent shall send a notice to all Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders or A/R Revolving Loan Lenders, as the case may be (each, a &#8220;Commitment Increase Request Notice&#8221;), informing them of Borrowers&#8217; request to increase the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or Total A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be, and of the facility fees to be paid with respect thereto.  Each Real Estate Revolving 65 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Loan Lender or A/R Revolving Loan Lender, as the case may be, who desires to provide a portion of the Commitment Increase upon such terms shall provide Administrative Agent with a written commitment letter specifying the portion of the Commitment Increase which it is willing to provide prior to such deadline as may be specified in the Commitment Increase Request Notice.  If the requested increase is oversubscribed, Administrative Agent and KeyBanc shall allocate the Commitment Increase among the Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders or A/R Revolving Loan Lenders, as the case may be, who provide such commitment letters on such basis as Administrative Agent and KeyBanc shall determine in their sole discretion.  If the increases to the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or Total A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be, so provided are not sufficient to provide the full amount of the Commitment Increase requested by Borrowers, then Administrative Agent, KeyBanc or Borrowers may, but shall not be obligated to, invite one or more banks or lending institutions (which banks or lending institutions shall be acceptable to Administrative Agent, KeyBanc and Parent) to become a Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender or an A/R Revolving Loan Lenders, as the case may be, and provide a portion of the Commitment Increase.  Administrative Agent shall provide all Lenders with a notice setting forth the amount, if any, of the Commitment Increase to be provided by each Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender or A/R Revolving Loan Lender, as the case may be, and the revised Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentages or A/R Revolving Loan Commitment Percentages, as the case may be, which shall be applicable after the Increase Effective Date.  In no event shall any Lender be obligated to increase its Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be. (b) The terms and provisions of the Real Estate Revolving Loans or A/R Revolving Loans, as the case may be, made pursuant to the Commitment Increases shall be as follows: (i) terms and provisions of Loans made pursuant to the Commitment Increases shall be identical to the existing Real Estate Revolving Loans or A/R Revolving Loans, as the case may be (except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.10(a) with respect to the facility fees paid in connection therewith), it being understood that the Loans made pursuant to the Commitment Increases will be, for all intents and purposes, Real Estate Revolving Loans or A/R Revolving Loans, as the case may be, and all references in the Loan Documents to Real Estate Revolving Loans or A/R Revolving Loans, as the case may be, shall be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires, to include references to Loans made pursuant to the Commitment Increases that are Real Estate Revolving Loans or A/R Revolving Loans, as the case may be, made pursuant to this Agreement; and (ii) the maturity date of Real Estate Revolving Loans or A/R Revolving Loans, as the case may be, shall be the Maturity Date. (c) Upon each Increase Effective Date of each increase in the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or Total A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.10, (i) the applicable Commitment Increase shall be effected by a joinder agreement (the &#8220;Increase Joinder&#8221;) executed by Borrowers, Guarantors, Administrative Agent and each Lender making a portion of such Commitment Increase, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of them, and the Increase Joinder may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.10, (ii) Administrative Agent may unilaterally revise Schedule 1.1(a) to reflect the name and address, Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be, and Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage or A/R Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage, as the case may be, of each Lender following such increase and (iii) Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent a new Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be, for each Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender or A/R Revolving Loan Lender, as the case may be, whose Real Estate 66 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Revolving Loan Commitment or A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be, has changed so that the principal amount of such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s or A/R Revolving Loan Lender&#8217;s, as the case may be, Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be, shall equal its Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be.  Administrative Agent shall deliver such replacement Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be, to the respective Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders or A/R Revolving Loan Lenders, as the case may be, in exchange for the Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be, replaced thereby which shall be surrendered by such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders or A/R Revolving Loan Lenders, as the case may be.  Each such new Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be, shall provide that it is a replacement for the applicable surrendered Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be, and that it does not constitute a novation, shall be dated as of the applicable Increase Effective Date and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of the replaced Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be.  Concurrently with the issuance of any new Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.10(c), Borrowers shall deliver an opinion of counsel, addressed to the Lenders and Administrative Agent, relating to the due authorization, execution and delivery of such new Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be, and the enforceability thereof, in form and substance substantially similar to the opinion delivered in connection with the first disbursement under this Agreement. The surrendered Real Estate Revolving Loan Note or A/R Revolving Loan Note, as the case may be, shall be canceled and returned to Borrowers. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Borrowers may not request any Commitment Increase unless the following conditions precedent are satisfied prior to the effectiveness of thereof, which conditions cannot be waived without the consent of all of the Lenders: (i) Payment of Activation Fee.  Borrowers shall pay (A) to Administrative Agent and KeyBanc those fees described in and contemplated by the Administrative Agent Fee Letter with respect to the applicable Commitment Increase, and (B) to KeyBanc such facility fees as the Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders or A/R Revolving Loan Lenders, as the case may be, who are providing a portion of such Commitment Increase may require to fund such increase, which fees shall, when paid, be fully earned and non-refundable under any circumstances.  KeyBanc shall pay to the Lenders providing a portion of such Commitment Increase such facility fees pursuant to their separate agreement; (ii) [Intentionally Omitted]; (iii) Sections 10 and 11.  On the date any Increase Notice is given and on the Increase Effective Date, both immediately before and after the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or Total A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be, is increased, the conditions set forth in Sections 10 and 11 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation; (iv) Representations True.  The representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents or otherwise made by or on behalf of the Loan Parties in connection therewith or after the date thereof shall have been true and correct in all material respects when made and shall also be true and correct in all material respects (except on account of changes in the facts and circumstances after the date such representation and warranty was made that resulted from actions or inactions not prohibited by this Agreement) on the date of such Increase Notice and on the date the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or Total A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be, is increased, both immediately before and after the Total Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment or Total A/R Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be, is increased; 67 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

Borrowers shall have the one-time right and option to extend the Maturity Date to September 5, 2024, upon satisfaction of the following conditions precedent, which must be satisfied prior to the effectiveness of any extension of the Maturity Date: (a) Extension Request.  Parent shall deliver written notice of such request (the &#8220;Extension Request&#8221;) to Administrative Agent not earlier than the date which is one hundred fifty (150) days and not later than the date which is thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date (as determined without regard to such extension), or such shorter period of time as may be approved by Administrative 68 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Agent in its reasonable discretion.  The Extension Request shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrowers. (b) Payment of Extension Fee.

The representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents or otherwise made by or on behalf of the Loan Parties in connection therewith or after the date thereof pursuant to the Loan Documents shall have been true and correct in all material respects when made and shall also be true and correct in all material respects (except on account of changes in the facts and circumstances after the date such representation and warranty was made that resulted from actions or inactions not prohibited by this Agreement), it being understood and agreed that any representation or warranty which by its terms is made as of a specified date shall be required to be true and correct only as of such specified date) on the date the Extension Request is given and on the Maturity Date (as determined without regard to such extension). (e) Additional Documents and Expenses.  The Loan Parties shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent and the Lenders such additional commercially reasonable opinions, consents and affirmations and other documents (including amendments to the Security Documents) as Administrative Agent may reasonably require; provided that none of the foregoing shall create any new obligations on any Borrowers, Guarantors or any Operator, or reduce the rights of such parties, and Borrowers shall pay the out-of-pocket cost of any title endorsement or update thereto or any update of UCC searches, recordings costs and fees, and any and all intangible taxes or other documentary or mortgage taxes, assessments or charges or any other fees, taxes, charges or expenses which are required to be paid in connection with such extension.

Section 2.12 Defaulting Lenders. (a) If for any reason any Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender, then, in addition to the rights and remedies that may be available to Administrative Agent or Borrowers under this Agreement or applicable law, such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s right to participate in the administration of the Loans, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including any right to vote in respect of, to consent to or to direct any action or inaction of any Agent or to be taken into account in the calculation of the Majority Lenders, the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders, the Majority A/R Revolving 69 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Loan Lenders or all of the Lenders, shall be suspended during the pendency of such failure or refusal.  If a Lender is a Defaulting Lender because it has failed to make timely payment to Administrative Agent or Revolving Agent of any amount required to be paid to such Agent hereunder (without giving effect to any notice or cure periods), in addition to other rights and remedies which such Agent or Borrowers may have under the immediately preceding provisions or otherwise, such Agent shall be entitled (i) to collect interest from such Defaulting Lender on such delinquent payment for the period from the date on which the payment was due until the date on which the payment is made at the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (ii) to withhold or setoff and to apply in satisfaction of the defaulted payment and any related interest, any amounts otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (iii) to bring an action or suit against such Defaulting Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the defaulted amount and any related interest.  Any amounts received by any Agent in respect of a Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Loans shall be applied as set forth in Section 2.12(d). (b) Any Non-Defaulting Lender may, but shall not be obligated, in its sole discretion, to acquire all or a portion of a Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Commitments.  Any Lender desiring to exercise such right shall give written notice thereof to Administrative Agent and Borrowers no sooner than two (2) Business Days and not later than five (5) Business Days after such Defaulting Lender became a Defaulting Lender.  If more than one Lender exercises such right, each such Lender shall have the right to acquire an amount of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Commitments in proportion to the Commitments of the other Lenders exercising such right.  If after such fifth Business Day, the Lenders have not elected to purchase all of the Commitments of such Defaulting Lender, then Borrowers (so long as no Event of Default exists) or the Majority Lenders may, by giving written notice thereof to Administrative Agent, such Defaulting Lender and the other Lenders, demand that such Defaulting Lender assign its Commitments to an eligible assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 18.1 for the purchase price provided for below.  No party hereto shall have any obligation whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an eligible assignee.  Upon any such purchase or assignment, and any such demand with respect to which the conditions specified in Section 18.1 have been satisfied, the Defaulting Lender&#8217;s interest in the Loans and its rights hereunder (but not its liability in respect thereof or under the Loan Documents or this Agreement to the extent the same relate to the period prior to the effective date of the purchase) shall terminate on the date of purchase, and the Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest to the purchaser or assignee thereof, including an appropriate Assignment and Acceptance Agreement.  The purchase price for the Commitments of a Defaulting Lender shall be equal to the amount of the principal balance of the Loans outstanding and owed by Borrowers to the Defaulting Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees.  Prior to payment of such purchase price to a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent shall apply against such purchase price any amounts retained by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.12(d). (c) During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, all or any part of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s obligation to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.9(g) or Swing Loans pursuant to Section 2.4(e) shall be reallocated among the A/R Revolving Loan Lenders (with respect to A/R Swing Loans) or Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders (with respect to Real Estate Swing Loans and Letters of Credit) that are Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective A/R Revolving Loan Commitment Percentages or Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentages, as applicable, (computed without giving effect to the A/R Revolving Loan Commitment or Real Estate Revolving Loans Commitment, as applicable, of such Defaulting Lender; provided that (i) the aggregate obligation of each Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender that is a Non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Real Estate Swing Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (A) the Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment of that Non-Defaulting Lender minus (B) the sum of (1) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the applicable Real Estate Revolving Loans of that Lender plus (2) such Lender&#8217;s pro rata 70 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 portion in accordance with its Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage of outstanding Letter of Credit Liabilities and Real Estate Swing Loans, and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each A/R Revolving Loan Lender that is a Non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in A/R Swing Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (A) the A/R Revolving Loan Commitment of that Non-Defaulting Lender minus (B) the sum of (1) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the applicable A/R Revolving Loans of that Lender plus (2) such Lender&#8217;s pro rata portion in accordance with its A/R Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage of outstanding A/R Swing Loans.  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender&#8217;s increased exposure following such reallocation. (d) Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 13), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender pro rata to Agents hereunder (other than with respect to Letter of Credit Liabilities); second, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lender (with respect to Letter of Credit Liabilities) and/or the Swing Loan Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by Administrative Agent or requested by the Issuing Lender or the Swing Loan Lender, to be held as cash collateral for future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Letter of Credit or Swing Loan; fourth, as Borrowers may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by Administrative Agent and Borrowers, to be held in a non-interest bearing Deposit Account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans or participations under this Agreement and (y) be held as cash collateral for future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Letter of Credit or Swing Loan; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to any Agent or the Lenders (including the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender) as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Agent or any Lender (including the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender) against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (i) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or funded participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (ii) such Loans or funded participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Sections 10 and 11, to the extent required by this Agreement, were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and funded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders that are Lenders with the applicable Commitment on a pro rata basis until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their Commitment Percentages without regard to Section 2.12(c), prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or funded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans owed to, such Defaulting Lender.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.12(d) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably 71 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

(e) Within five (5) Business Days of demand by the Issuing Lender or the Swing Loan Lender from time to time, Borrowers shall deliver to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender cash collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Sections 2.4(a), 2.9(a) and 2.12(c)) on terms satisfactory to the Issuing Lender and/or the Swing Loan Lender in its good faith determination (and such cash collateral shall be in Dollars).  Any such cash collateral shall be deposited in the Collateral Account as collateral (solely for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and/or the Swing Loan Lender) for the payment and performance of each Defaulting Lender&#8217;s pro rata portion in accordance with their respective Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentages of outstanding Letter of Credit Liabilities and Real Estate Swing Loans and A/R Revolving Loan Commitment Percentages of outstanding A/R Swing Loans.  Moneys in the Collateral Account deposited pursuant to this Section 2.12(e) shall be applied by Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Lender and/or the Swing Loan Lender immediately for each Defaulting Lender&#8217;s pro rata portion in accordance with their respective Real Estate Revolving Loan Commitment Percentages or A/R Revolving Loan Commitment Percentages, as applicable, of any funding obligation with respect to a Letter of Credit or Swing Loan which has not otherwise been reimbursed by Borrowers or such Defaulting Lender.

(g) If Parent (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists) and Administrative Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.12(c)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrowers while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from 72 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender having been a Defaulting Lender. Section 2.13 Borrowing Agency Provisions; Joint and Several Liability; Waivers; Subrogation; Subordination. (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Parent, and Parent hereby irrevocably agrees, to act under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as the agent and representative of itself and each other Borrower for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including requesting Loans and Letters of Credit, selecting whether any Loan or portion thereof is to bear interest as a Base Rate Loan or a LIBORSOFR Rate Loan, and receiving account statements and other notices and communications to Borrowers (or any of them) from Administrative Agent or Revolving Agent.  Administrative Agent and Revolving Agent may rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, on any Loan Request, Letter of Credit Request, Increase Notice, Conversion/Continuation Request, Real Estate Borrowing Base Certificate, A/R Borrowing Base Certificate, Compliance Certificate, disbursement instructions, reports, information, or any other notice or communication made or given by Parent, whether in its own name, on behalf of any Borrower or on behalf of &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;, and neither Administrative Agent nor Revolving Agent shall have any obligation to make any inquiry or request any confirmation from or on behalf of any other Borrower as to the binding effect on such Borrower of any such Loan Request, Letter of Credit Request, Increase Notice, Conversion/Continuation Request, Real Estate Borrowing Base Certificate, A/R Borrowing Base Certificate, Compliance Certificate, instruction, report, information or other notice or communication, nor shall the joint and several character of Borrowers&#8217; liability for the Obligations be affected.  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Administrative Agent to pay over or credit all loan proceeds hereunder in accordance with the request of Parent. (b) The handling of this credit facility as a co-borrowing facility with a borrowing agent in the manner set forth in this Agreement is solely as an accommodation to Borrowers and at their request.  None of Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent nor any Lender shall incur liability to Borrowers as a result of structuring the facility as a co-borrowing facility.  To induce Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent and the Lenders to do so and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby indemnifies Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent and each Lender and holds Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities and claims of damage or injury asserted and actual out-of-pocket expenses, losses and damages against or of Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent or any Lender by any Person arising from or incurred by reason of the handling of the financing arrangements of Borrowers as provided herein, reliance by Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent or any Lender on any request or instruction from Parent or any other action taken by Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent or any Lender with respect to this Section 2.13 except due to willful misconduct or gross (not mere) negligence by the indemnified party (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment). (c) All Obligations shall constitute joint and several obligations of Borrowers and shall be secured by Administrative Agent&#8217;s security interest (on behalf of the Secured Parties) and Lien upon all of the Collateral, and by all other security interests and Liens heretofore, now or at any time hereafter granted by each Loan Party to the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the extent provided in the Security Documents under which such Lien arises. Each Borrower expressly represents and acknowledges that it is part of a common enterprise with the other Borrowers and that any financial accommodations by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to any other Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are and will be of direct and indirect interest, benefit and advantage to all Borrowers. Each Borrower acknowledges that any Loan Request, Letter of Credit Request, Conversion or other notice given by any Borrower to Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent or any Lender shall bind 73 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 all Borrowers, and that any notice given by Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent or any Lender to any Borrower shall be effective with respect to all Borrowers.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Parent by a Lender or Revolving Agent (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided that the determinations in such statement are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith. (e) Each Lender shall severally indemnify Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Borrower has not already indemnified Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of Borrowers to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 18.4 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

If a Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender shall fail to respond within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, such Real Estate Revolving Loan Lender shall be deemed to have approved such proposed Potential Collateral.  Administrative Agent shall notify Parent if and when the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders have granted such preliminary approval.  In the event that the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders grant such preliminary approval, Borrowers and the Guarantors shall satisfy the remaining requirements to the acceptance of such Collateral as provided in Section 5.4(a).  Such Real Estate shall not be included in the calculation of the Real Estate Borrowing Base Availability until the requirements of Section 5.4(a) are satisfied. 99 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

Schedule 6.24 sets forth all agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust, financing agreements or other material agreements binding upon each Loan Party or the Collateral Properties and entered into by such Loan Party as of the Closing Date with respect to any Indebtedness of any Loan Party in an amount greater than $5,000,000.00, and Borrowers have notified Administrative Agent of such documents and provided Administrative Agent with such true, correct and complete copies thereof as requested by Administrative Agent.

(b) In addition to the foregoing, Borrowers will procure and maintain (or cause to be maintained) insurance covering Borrowers and the Collateral and their other assets in such amounts and against such risks and casualties as are customary for properties of similar character and location, due regard being given to the type of improvements thereon, their construction, location, use and occupancy, and shall:  (i) keep all its insurable properties and properties in which such Borrower has an interest insured against the hazards of fire, flood, sprinkler leakage, those hazards covered by extended coverage insurance and such other hazards, and for such amounts, as is customary in the case of companies engaged in businesses similar to Borrowers, including business interruption insurance; (ii) maintain insurance coverage in such amounts as is customary in the case of companies engaged in businesses similar to Borrowers insuring against larceny, embezzlement or other criminal misappropriation of insured&#8217;s officers and employees who may either singly or jointly with others at any time have access to the assets or funds of any Borrower either directly or through authority to draw upon such funds or to direct generally the disposition of such assets; (iii) maintain public and product liability insurance against claims for personal injury, death or property damage suffered by others; (iv) maintain all such worker&#8217;s compensation or similar insurance as may be required under the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which any Borrower is engaged in business; and (v) furnish Administrative Agent with appropriate endorsements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, naming Administrative Agent as a co-insured and lender loss payee as its interests may appear with respect to all insurance coverage referred to in Sections 7.7(a)(i) and 7.7(a)(iii) relating to the Collateral Properties, and providing (1) that all proceeds thereunder shall be payable to Administrative Agent, (2) no such insurance shall be affected by any act or neglect of the insured or owner of the property described in such policy, and (3) that such policy and lender loss payable clauses may not be cancelled, amended or terminated unless at least thirty (30) days (or ten (10) days in the case of nonpayment of premiums) prior written notice is given to Administrative Agent.  The carriers named therein hereby are directed by Administrative Agent and Borrowers to make payment for such loss to Administrative Agent and not to Borrowers and Administrative Agent jointly.  If any such insurance losses are paid by check, draft or other instrument payable to Borrowers and Administrative Agent jointly, Administrative Agent may endorse Borrowers&#8217; names thereon and do such other things as Administrative Agent may deem advisable to reduce the same to cash.  Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to adjust and compromise claims under insurance coverage referred to in Section 7.7(a)(i) relating to the Collateral Properties.  All loss recoveries received by Administrative Agent upon any such insurance may be applied to the Obligations, in such order as Administrative Agent in its sole discretion shall determine. Any surplus shall be paid by Administrative Agent to Borrowers or applied as may be otherwise required by applicable law.  Any deficiency thereon shall be paid by Borrowers to Administrative Agent, on demand.  Each Borrower shall bear the full risk of any loss of any nature whatsoever with respect to the Collateral. 126 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 (c) Borrowers shall pay all premiums on insurance policies.  The insurance policies with respect to all Collateral Property provided for in Sections 7.7(a)(v), 7.7(a)(vi) and 7.7(a)(viii) shall name Administrative Agent as an additional insured and shall contain a cross liability/severability endorsement as their interest may appear.  The insurance policies provided for in Sections 7.7(a)(i), 7.7(a)(ii), 7.7(a)(iii) and 7.7(a)(iv) shall name Administrative Agent as mortgagee and loss payee, shall be first payable in case of loss to Administrative Agent, and shall contain mortgage clauses and lender&#8217;s loss payable endorsements in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent. Borrowers shall deliver certificates of insurance evidencing all such policies to Administrative Agent, and Borrowers shall promptly furnish to Administrative Agent all renewal notices and evidence that all premiums or portions thereof then due and payable have been paid.  Not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration date of the policies, as the same may be reduced by Administrative Agent, Borrowers shall deliver to Administrative Agent evidence of continued coverage, as may be reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, and within five (5) Business Days after the renewal date of such policies, Borrowers shall deliver a certificate of insurance to Administrative Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent. (d) All policies of insurance required by this Agreement shall contain clauses or endorsements to the effect that (i) no act or omission of any Borrower, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Operator or anyone acting for any Borrower, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Operator (including any representations made in the procurement of such insurance), which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of such insurance or any part thereof, no occupancy or use of the Real Estate or the Collateral for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms of the policy, and no foreclosure or any other change in title to the Real Estate or the Collateral or any part thereof, shall affect the validity or enforceability of such insurance insofar as Administrative Agent is concerned, (ii) the insurer waives any subrogation in respect of any liability of any Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries and Administrative Agent, (iii) such insurance is primary and without right of contribution from any other insurance which may be available, (iv) such policies shall not be modified so as to reduce or in any way negatively affect insurance coverage on any Real Estate or any Collateral, canceled or terminated prior to the scheduled expiration date thereof without the Borrowers giving reasonable written notice to Administrative Agent by certified or registered mail; provided, however, that only ten (10) days prior written notice to Administrative Agent shall be required if such cancellation or termination is due to non-payment of any insurance premium, and (v) that no Agent or Lender shall be liable for any premiums thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder, and such policies of insurance shall in all events be in amounts sufficient to avoid any coinsurance liability. (e) The insurance required by this Agreement may be secured through a blanket policy or policies covering additional locations and property of Borrowers not included in the Real Estate or the Collateral, provided that such blanket policy or policies comply with all of the terms and provisions of this Section 7.7, including Administrative Agent&#8217;s reasonable determination based on a review of the schedule of locations and values that the amount of such coverage is sufficient in light of the other risks and properties insured under the blanket policy. (f) All policies of insurance required by this Agreement shall be issued by companies licensed to do business in the State where the policy is issued and also in the States where the Real Estate is located and shall be issued by companies having a rating in Best&#8217;s Key Rating Guide of at least &#8220;A&#8221; and a financial size category of at least &#8220;X&#8221;. (g) None of Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries shall carry separate insurance, concurrent in kind or form or contributing in the event of loss, with any insurance required under this Agreement unless such insurance complies with the terms and provisions of this Section 7.7. 127 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">(h) In the event of any loss or damage to any Collateral Property, the applicable Borrower shall give prompt written notice to the insurance carrier and Administrative Agent.  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers, subject to the terms of this Section 7.7(h) and Section 7.7(i), Administrative Agent, at Administrative Agent&#8217;s option and in Administrative Agent&#8217;s reasonable discretion or at the request of the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders in their reasonable discretion, as its attorney in fact, to make proof of such loss, to adjust and compromise any claim under insurance policies, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from such insurance policies, to collect and receive insurance proceeds and condemnation proceeds, and to deduct therefrom Administrative Agent&#8217;s reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the collection of such insurance proceeds; provided, however, that so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and so long as any Borrower shall in good faith diligently pursue such claim, such Borrower may make proof of loss and appear in any proceedings or negotiations with respect to the adjustment of such claim and, subject to Administrative Agent&#8217;s consent rights set forth below, make all decisions with respect thereto, except that neither any Borrower nor any other Person may settle, adjust or compromise any such claim without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, further, that such Borrower may make proof of loss and adjust and compromise any claim under casualty insurance policies which is in an amount less than $750,000.00 so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and so long as such Borrower shall in good faith diligently pursue such claim.  Each Borrower further authorizes Administrative Agent, at Administrative Agent&#8217;s option, to (i) apply the excess balance of such insurance proceeds and condemnation proceeds following completion of the reconstruction or repair, if applicable, to the payment of the Obligations whether or not then due, or (ii) if Administrative Agent shall require the reconstruction or repair of the Collateral Property, to hold the balance of such proceeds as trustee to be used to pay taxes, charges, sewer use fees, water rates and assessments which may be imposed on the Collateral Property and the Obligations as they become due during the course of reconstruction or repair of the Collateral Property, and to reimburse such Borrower, in accordance with such terms and conditions as Administrative Agent may prescribe, for, or to pay directly, the costs of reconstruction or repair of the Collateral Property and upon completion of such reconstruction or repair to pay any excess insurance proceeds to Borrowers, provided that (i) upon completion of such reconstruction or repair, the Collateral Property is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable state, federal and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including all building and zoning laws, ordinances and regulations and (ii) no Defaults or Events of Default exist or are continuing under this Agreement on the date of such payment to Borrowers. (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in the Mortgages, Administrative Agent shall make net insurance proceeds and condemnation proceeds available to such Borrower to reconstruct and repair the Collateral Property, in accordance with such terms and conditions as Administrative Agent may prescribe in Administrative Agent&#8217;s good faith and reasonable discretion for the disbursement of the proceeds, provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) such Borrower shall have demonstrated to Administrative Agent&#8217;s reasonable discretion the availability of funds to cover any additional cash security in an amount equal to the amount reasonably estimated by Administrative Agent to be the amount in excess of such proceeds which will be required to complete such repair or restoration and such Borrower does in fact expend such amount for such purpose, (iii) Administrative Agent shall have approved the plans and specifications, construction budget, construction contracts, and construction schedule for such repair or restoration, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned (provided that Administrative Agent shall not disapprove such plans and specifications if the Building is to be restored to substantially its condition immediately prior to such damage), (iv) such Borrower shall have delivered to Administrative Agent written agreements binding upon each Operator, agreeing upon a date for delivery of possession of the Collateral Property or their respective portions thereof, to permit time which is sufficient in the reasonable judgment of Administrative Agent for such 128 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 repair or restoration and approving the plans and specifications for such repair or restoration, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent that none of such Operators may terminate their Leases or other agreements as a result of such casualty or as a result of having a right to approve the plans and specifications for such repair or restoration and prior to the exhaustion of expiration of any rental loss insurance coverage, (v) Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine that such repair or reconstruction can be completed prior to the Maturity Date and prior to the exhaustion of the benefits provided by the insurance described in Section 7.7(a)(iv), (vi) Administrative Agent shall receive evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that any such restoration, repair or rebuilding will comply in all material respects with any and all applicable state, federal and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including zoning laws, ordinances and regulations, and that all required permits, licenses and approvals relative thereto have been or will be issued in a manner so as not to materially impede the progress of restoration, (vii) Administrative Agent shall receive evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that the insurer under such policies of fire or other casualty insurance does not assert any defense to any payment under such policies with respect to such damage against any Borrower or Administrative Agent, unless such assertion is made prior to the commencement of restoration and Borrowers shall have demonstrated to Administrative Agent&#8217;s reasonable discretion the availability of funds to cover any payment amount at issue prior to such commencement, and such Borrower does in fact expend such amount for such purpose, and (viii) with respect to any Taking, Administrative Agent shall determine that following such repair or restoration there shall be no non-de minimis reduction in occupancy or rental income from the Collateral Property so affected by such specific condemnation or taking and that, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of Administrative Agent, determined after consultation in good faith with the applicable Borrower and giving special consideration to such Borrower&#8217;s provision of care to residents, compliance with applicable law and prudent standards of care with respect to the operation of the affected Collateral Property, such Taking does not render the affected Collateral Property unsuitable for continued use as a skilled nursing facility or assisted living facility, as the case may be.  Any excess insurance proceeds shall be paid to Borrowers, or if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such proceeds shall be applied to the payment of the Obligations, unless in either case by the terms of the applicable insurance policy the excess proceeds are required to be returned to such insurer.  Any excess condemnation proceeds shall be applied to the payment of the Obligations, with the remainder to Borrowers.  In no event shall the provisions of this Section 7.7(i) be construed to extend the Maturity Date or to limit in any way any right or remedy of Administrative Agent upon the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder.  If the Collateral Property is sold or the Collateral Property is acquired by Administrative Agent following an Event of Default, all right, title and interest of any Borrower in and to any insurance policies to the extent that they relate to Collateral Properties and unearned premiums thereon and in and to the proceeds thereof resulting from loss or damage to the Collateral Property prior to the sale or acquisition shall pass to Administrative Agent or any other successor in interest to the applicable Borrower or purchaser of the Collateral Property. Section 7.8 Taxes; Liens.  Borrowers and Guarantors will duly pay and discharge, or cause to be paid and discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, all property taxes and all other material taxes, assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon them or upon the Collateral Properties or the other Real Estate, sales and activities, or any part thereof, or upon the income or profits therefrom as well as all claims for labor, materials or supplies that if unpaid might by law become a lien or charge upon any of its property or other Liens affecting any of the Collateral or other property of Borrowers and all non-governmental assessments, levies, maintenance and other charges, whether resulting from covenants, conditions and restrictions or otherwise, water and sewer rents and charges assessments on any water stock, utility charges and assessments and owner association dues, fees and levies, provided that any such tax, assessment, charge or levy or claim need not be paid if the validity or amount thereof shall currently be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings which shall suspend the collection thereof with respect to such property and the applicable Loan Party shall not be subject to any fine, suspension or loss of privileges or rights by reason of such proceeding, neither such property 129 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 nor any portion thereof or interest therein would be in any danger of sale, forfeiture, loss or suspension of operation by reason of such proceeding and such Loan Party shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP; and provided, further, that forthwith upon the commencement of proceedings to foreclose any lien that may have attached as security therefor, such Loan Party either (i) will provide a bond issued by a surety reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent and sufficient to stay all such proceedings or (ii) if no such bond is provided, will pay each such tax, assessment, charge or levy. Section 7.9 Inspection of Properties and Books. (a) Borrowers, Borrowers&#8217; respective Subsidiaries and Guarantors will permit Administrative Agent and the Lenders, at Borrowers&#8217; expense, upon reasonable prior notice and, if no Event of Default exists, during business hours, to visit and inspect, subject to HIPAA and all other applicable privacy laws, any of the properties of each Borrower (including with respect to any IGT Facility), to examine the books of account of any Borrower, any Guarantor and Borrower&#8217;s respective Subsidiaries (including with respect to any IGT Facility) (and to make copies thereof and extracts therefrom) and to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of any Borrower, any Guarantor and Borrower&#8217;s respective Subsidiaries (including with respect to any IGT Facility) with, and to be advised as to the same by, their respective officers, partners or members, all at such reasonable times and intervals as Administrative Agent or any Lender may reasonably request; provided, however, that such visits and inspections shall be limited to one (1) time per year unless an Event of Default exists.  The Lenders shall use good faith efforts to coordinate such visits and inspections so as to minimize the interference with and disruption to the normal business operations of such Persons. (b) Each Loan Party will permit Revolving Agent and each of its duly authorized representatives or agents to conduct field examinations, appraisals and valuations (including audits of the Accounts) at such reasonable times (during regular business hours) and intervals as Revolving Agent may designate, provided that the obligation of Borrowers to reimburse Revolving Agent for the costs of any such field examinations, appraisals and valuations shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4.2(b). Section 7.10 Compliance with Laws, Contracts, Licenses, and Permits.  Borrowers will, and will cause the Operators of the Real Estate to, comply with (a) all applicable laws and regulations now or hereafter in effect wherever its business is conducted, including all Environmental Laws, in all material respects, (b) the provisions of its corporate charter, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or declaration of trust, as the case may be, and other charter documents and bylaws, (c) all agreements and instruments to which it is a party or by which it or any of the Real Estate may be bound, (d) all applicable decrees, orders, and judgments affecting the Real Estate, and (e) all Permits required by applicable laws and regulations for the conduct of its business or the ownership, use or operation of the Collateral Properties or other Senior Care Properties; except where failure to so comply with any of clause (a) through (e) would not result in the material non-compliance with the items described in such clauses.  If any Permit from any officer, agency or instrumentality of any government shall become necessary or required in order that any Borrower may fulfill any of its obligations hereunder, such Borrower will promptly take or cause to be taken all steps necessary to obtain such Permit and, following a request by Administrative Agent, furnish Administrative Agent and the Lenders with evidence thereof. Each Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, develop and implement such programs, policies and procedures as are necessary to comply with the Patriot Act and shall promptly advise Administrative Agent in writing in the event that such Borrower shall determine that any investors in such Borrower are in violation of such act. 130 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Section 7.11 Further Assurances.  Each Borrower and each Guarantor will cooperate with Administrative Agent and the Lenders and execute such further instruments and documents as Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to carry out to their reasonable satisfaction the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided that no such instruments or documents shall create any new obligations of Borrower or Guarantor or reduce any of their rights.  In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, each Borrower shall take such actions as Administrative Agent may reasonably request from time to time to ensure that the Obligations are secured by IGT Liens. Section 7.12 Collateral Properties. (a) Borrowers shall cause the Eligible Owned Real Estate and Eligible Villa Units included in the calculation of the Real Estate Borrowing Base Availability and inclusion as Collateral Properties or Villa Units, as the case may be, to at all times satisfy all of the following conditions: (i) the Eligible Owned Real Estate or Eligible Villa Units, as the case may be, shall be Senior Care Properties that are owned one hundred percent (100%) in fee simple (or, if applicable, leasehold) by a Borrower, free and clear of all Liens other than the Liens expressly permitted in Section 8.2(v) as to the Collateral Properties, and such Eligible Owned Real Estate or Eligible Villa Units, as the case may be, shall not have applicable to it any restriction on the sale, pledge, transfer, mortgage or assignment of such property (including any restrictions contained in the above-described Permitted Liens, Applicable Law and any applicable organizational documents); (ii) none of the Eligible Owned Real Estate or Eligible Villa Units, as the case may be,  shall be subject to any condemnation proceeding, that in any event would give rise to a materially adverse effect as to the value, use of, operation of or ability to sell or finance such Real Estate; (iii) no strike, lockout, labor dispute, embargo, injunction or other proceeding (but only to the extent within Borrowers&#8217; reasonable control to prevent) occurs which causes, for more than fifteen (15) consecutive days, the cessation or substantial curtailment of revenue producing activities of any Borrower or any Operator at such property; (iv) such Eligible Owned Real Estate or Eligible Villa Units, as the case may be, are (A) leased by a Borrower to a Borrower that is an OpCo Affiliate under a Lease approved by Administrative Agent and (B) operated and managed by EIK Manager under a Management Agreement reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent; (v) except with respect to Primary Licenses held by an IGT Hospital pursuant to an IGT Transaction, the applicable OpCo Affiliate is the holder of all Primary Licenses for such Eligible Owned Real Estate or Eligible Villa Units; and (vi) such Eligible Owned Real Estate or Eligible Villa Units, as the case may be, have not been removed from the calculation of the Real Estate Borrowing Base Availability pursuant to Section 5.3, Section 7.12(b), 7.12(c) or 7.12(d).

Upon demand by Administrative Agent or the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders in their absolute and sole discretion after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and regardless of whether the conditions precedent in this Agreement for a Real Estate Revolving Loan have been satisfied, the Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders will cause a Real Estate Revolving Loan to be made in the undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit.  The proceeds of any such Real Estate Revolving Loan will be pledged to and held by Administrative Agent as security for any amounts that become payable under the Letters of Credit.  In the alternative, if demanded by Administrative Agent in its absolute and sole discretion after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrowers will deposit into the Collateral Account and pledge to Administrative Agent cash in an amount equal to 105% of the amount of all undrawn Letters of Credit.  Such amounts will be pledged to and held by Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders as security for any amounts that become payable under the Letters of Credit.  Upon any draws under Letters of Credit, at Administrative Agent&#8217;s sole discretion, Administrative Agent may apply any such amounts to the repayment of amounts drawn thereunder and upon the expiration of the Letters of Credit any remaining amounts will be applied to the payment of all other Obligations or if there are no outstanding Obligations and the Lenders have no further obligation to make Real Estate Revolving Loans, A/R Revolving Loans or issue Letters of Credit or if such excess no longer exists, such proceeds deposited by Borrowers will be released to Borrowers. Section 12.2 Certain Cure Periods; Limitation of Cure Periods. (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 12.1 to the contrary, (i) no Event of Default shall exist hereunder upon the occurrence of any failure described in Section 12.1(b) in the event that Borrowers cure such Default within five (5) Business Days after the date such payment is due (or, with respect to any payments other than interest on the Loans or any fees due under the Loan Documents, within five (5) Business Days after written notice thereof shall have been given to Parent by Administrative Agent), provided, however, that Borrowers shall not be entitled to receive more than two (2) grace or cure periods in the aggregate pursuant to this clause (i) in any period of three hundred sixty-five (365) days ending on the date of any such occurrence of Default, and provided further, that no such cure period shall apply to any payments due upon the maturity of the Notes, (ii) no Event of Default shall exist hereunder upon the occurrence of any failure described in Section 12.1(d) in the event that Borrowers cure (or causes to be cured) such Default within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice of such default, provided that the provisions of this clause (ii) shall not pertain to defaults consisting of a failure to provide insurance as required by Section 7.7, to any default (whether of any Borrower or any Guarantor) consisting of a failure to comply with Section 7.4(a)(iii)(A), 7.4(a)(x), 7.12, 7.13 (other than clause (b) of the first sentence thereof), 7.16, 7.17, 7.18, 7.19, 7.20, 7.21, 7.22, 7.25, 7.26, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, 8.12, 8.16, 8.17, 8.18 or 8.19, or to any Default excluded from any provision of cure of defaults contained in any other of the Loan Documents and (iii) no Event of Default shall exist hereunder upon the occurrence of any event of default under Section 12.1(k) with respect to any Management Agreement in the event Borrowers, within thirty (30) days of such occurrence, replace the existing EIK Manager and related Management Agreements with a successor EIK Manager and Management Agreements with such successor EIK Manager that, in each case, (A) comply with the requirements of this Agreement and (B) are approved by the Majority Lenders, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided that during that period there shall be no material adverse effect on any Loan Party&#8217;s, any Subsidiary of a Borrower&#8217;s or any Operator&#8217;s ability to accept or retain patients or residents, provide Ancillary Services at any Senior Care Property, receive payment or reimbursement for care or services provided at, or operate, any Senior Care Property for its current use with not less than the current number of licensed beds, shall not result in any material civil or 164 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 criminal penalty or remedy against any Loan Party, IGT Hospital or Operator, and shall not result in the appointment of a receiver or manager. (b) In the event that there shall occur any Default or Event of Default that affects only certain Collateral Properties or Senior Care Properties, or the owner(s) and/or Operator(s) thereof, then Borrowers may elect to cure such Default or Event of Default (so long as no other Default or Event of Default would arise as a result) by electing to have (i) if such Default or Event of Default affects one or more Collateral Properties, Administrative Agent remove such Collateral Properties from the calculation of the Collateral Pool Value and the Real Estate Borrowing Base Availability and reducing (to the extent necessary) the outstanding Real Estate Revolving Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities so that no Default or Event of Default exists under this Agreement or (ii) if such Default or Event of Default affects one or more other Senior Care Properties that are not Collateral Properties, Revolving Agent remove the applicable Borrowers from the calculation of A/R Borrowing Base Availability and reducing (to the extent necessary) the outstanding A/R Revolving Loans so that no Default or Event of Default exists under this Agreement, in which event such removal and reduction shall be completed within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of notice of such Default or Event of Default from Administrative Agent, the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders or the Majority A/R Revolving Loan Lenders and, following such time when such Collateral Property is removed from the calculation of the Collateral Pool Value and Real Estate Borrowing Base Availability or such Borrower is removed from the calculation of A/R Borrowing Base Availability, as the case may be, there shall be no Default or Event of Default solely with respect to such Collateral Property to the extent there are representations or warranties, covenants, Defaults or Events of Default that relate solely to such Collateral Property. Section 12.3 Termination of Total Commitment.  If any one or more Events of Default specified in Section 12.1(h), 12.1(i), 12.1(j) or 12.1(l) shall occur, then immediately and without any action on the part of Administrative Agent or any Lender any unused portion of the Total Commitment hereunder shall terminate and the Lenders shall be relieved of any obligations to make Loans or issue Letters of Credit hereunder.  If any other Event of Default shall have occurred, Administrative Agent may, and upon the election of the Majority A/R Revolving Loan Lenders or the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders, as applicable shall, by notice to Borrowers terminate the obligation to make A/R Revolving Loans, Real Estate Revolving Loans or issue Letters of Credit hereunder.  No termination under this Section 12.3 shall relieve Borrowers or the Guarantors of their obligations to the Lenders arising under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. Section 12.4 Remedies.  In case any one or more Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and whether or not the Lenders shall have accelerated the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 12.1, Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders may, and upon the direction of the Majority Lenders, shall proceed to protect and enforce their rights and remedies under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate proceeding, including to the full extent permitted by applicable law the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the obtaining of the ex parte appointment of a receiver, and, if any amount shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, the enforcement of the payment thereof.  No remedy herein conferred upon Administrative Agent or the holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or any other provision of law.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement providing that the Loans may be evidenced by multiple Notes in favor of the Lenders, the Lenders acknowledge and agree that only Administrative Agent may exercise any remedies arising by reason of a Default or Event of Default.  If any Loan Party fails to perform any agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents beyond any applicable period for notice and cure, Administrative Agent may itself perform, or cause to be performed, any agreement or covenant 165 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 of such Person contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents which such Person shall fail to perform, and the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of such performance, together with any reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees actually incurred (including attorneys&#8217; fees incurred in any appeal) by Administrative Agent in connection therewith, shall be payable by Borrowers upon demand and shall constitute a part of the Obligations and shall if not paid within five (5) days after demand bear interest at the Default Rate.  In the event that all or any portion of the Obligations is collected by or through an attorney-at-law, Borrowers shall pay all actual, out-of-pocket costs of collection including reasonable attorney&#8217;s fees. Section 12.5 Collateral Account. (a) As collateral security for the prompt payment in full when due of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, Swing Loans and the other Obligations, Borrowers hereby pledge and grant to Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of Administrative Agent and the Lenders as provided herein, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in and to the Collateral Account and the balances from time to time in the Collateral Account (including the investments and reinvestments therein provided for below).  The balances from time to time in the Collateral Account shall not constitute payment of any Letter of Credit Liabilities or Swing Loans until applied by Administrative Agent as provided herein.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, funds held in the Collateral Account shall be subject to withdrawal only as provided in this Section 12.5. (b) Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be invested and reinvested by Administrative Agent in such Cash Equivalents as Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion.  All such investments and reinvestments shall be held in the name of and be under the sole dominion and control of Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders.  Administrative Agent shall exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any funds held in the Collateral Account and shall be deemed to have exercised such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which Administrative Agent accords other funds deposited with Administrative Agent, it being understood that Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any funds held in the Collateral Account. (c) If a drawing pursuant to any Letter of Credit occurs on or prior to the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, Borrowers and the Lenders authorize Administrative Agent to use the monies deposited in the Collateral Account to make payment to the beneficiary with respect to such drawing or the payee with respect to such presentment.  If a Swing Loan is not refinanced as a Base Rate Loan as provided in Section 2.4, then Administrative Agent is authorized to use monies deposited in the Collateral Account to make payment to the Swing Loan Lender with respect to any participation not funded by a Defaulting Lender. (d) If an Event of Default exists, the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders may, in their discretion, at any time and from time to time, instruct Administrative Agent to liquidate any such investments and reinvestments and apply proceeds thereof to the Obligations in accordance with Section 3.6. (e) So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, and to the extent amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account exceed 105% of the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Liabilities then due and owing and the pro rata share of any Letter of Credit Liabilities and Swing Loans of any Defaulting Lender after giving effect to Section 2.12(c), Administrative Agent shall, from time to time, at the request of Parent, deliver to Parent on behalf of Borrowers within ten (10) Business Days after Administrative Agent&#8217;s receipt of such request from Parent, against receipt but without any recourse, 166 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 warranty or representation whatsoever, such of the balances in the Collateral Account as exceed the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Liabilities and Swing Loans at such time. (f) Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent from time to time such fees as Administrative Agent normally charges for similar services in connection with Administrative Agent&#8217;s administration of the Collateral Account and investments and reinvestments of funds therein.  Each Borrower authorizes Administrative Agent to file such financing statements as Administrative Agent may reasonably require in order to perfect Administrative Agent&#8217;s security interest in the Collateral Account, and each Borrower shall promptly upon demand execute and deliver to Administrative Agent such other documents as Administrative Agent may reasonably request to evidence its security interest in the Collateral Account. SECTION 13. SETOFF. Regardless of the adequacy of any Collateral, during the continuance of any Event of Default under Section 12.1(a) or Section 12.1(b), including in connection with any acceleration of the Obligations, any deposits (general or specific, time or demand, provisional or final, regardless of currency, maturity, or the branch where such deposits are held) or other sums credited by or due from any Lender to Borrowers or the Guarantors and any securities or other property of Borrowers or the Guarantors in the possession of such Lender may, without notice to any Borrower or any Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by each Borrower and each Guarantor) but with the prior written approval of Administrative Agent, be applied to or set off against the payment of Obligations and any and all other liabilities, direct, or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to become due, now existing or hereafter arising, of Borrowers or the Guarantors to such Lender.  Each of the Lenders agree with each other Lender that if such Lender shall receive from Borrowers or the Guarantors, whether by voluntary payment, exercise of the right of setoff, or otherwise, and shall retain and apply to the payment of the Note or Notes held by such Lender (but excluding the Swing Loan Note) any amount in excess of its ratable portion of the payments received by all of the Lenders with respect to the Notes held by all of the Lenders, such Lender will make such disposition and arrangements with the other Lenders with respect to such excess, either by way of distribution, pro tanto assignment of claims, subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each Lender receiving in respect of the Notes held by it its proportionate payment as contemplated by this Agreement; provided that if all or any part of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such disposition and arrangements shall be rescinded and the amount restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.  In the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (b) such Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. SECTION 14. AGENTS. Section 14.1 Authorization.  Each Agent is authorized to take such action on behalf of each of the Lenders and to exercise all such powers as are hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents and any related documents delegated to such Agent, together with such powers as are reasonably incident thereto, provided that no duties or responsibilities not expressly assumed herein or therein shall be implied to have been assumed by such Agent.  The obligations of each Agent hereunder are primarily administrative in nature, and nothing contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be construed to constitute such Agent as a trustee for any Lender or to create an agency or fiduciary relationship.  Administrative Agent shall act as the contractual representative of the Lenders hereunder, 167 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

Borrowers, Guarantors and any other Person shall be entitled to conclusively rely on a statement from an Agent that it has the authority to act for and bind the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Section 14.2 Employees and Agents.  Each Agent may exercise its powers and execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be entitled to take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to its rights and duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each Agent may utilize the services of such Persons as such Agent may reasonably determine, and all reasonable fees and expenses of any such Persons shall be paid by Borrowers. Section 14.3 No Liability.  Neither any Agent nor any of its shareholders, directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting them in their duties nor any agent, or employee thereof, shall be liable to any Lender for (a) any waiver, consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken, in good faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences of any oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that such Agent or such other Person, as the case may be, shall be liable for losses due to its willful misconduct or gross negligence as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction after the expiration of all applicable appeal periods or (b) any action taken or not taken by such Agent with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders or, as applicable, the Majority A/R Revolving Loan Lenders, the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be.  No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless such Agent has received notice from a Lender or any Borrower referring to the Loan Documents and describing with reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a &#8220;notice of default&#8221;. Section 14.4 No Representations.  No Agent shall be responsible for the execution or validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, any of the other Loan Documents or any instrument at any time constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the Notes, or for the value of any such collateral security or for the validity, enforceability or collectability of any such amounts owing with respect to the Notes, or for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made herein, or any agreement, instrument or certificate delivered in connection therewith or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate or instrument hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of Borrowers, the Guarantors or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements herein or in any of the other Loan Documents.  No Agent shall be bound to ascertain whether any notice, consent, waiver or request delivered to it by Borrowers, the Guarantors or any holder of any of the Notes shall have been duly authorized or is true, accurate and complete.  Neither Agent has made nor does it now make any representations or warranties, express or implied, nor does it assume any liability to the Secured Parties, with respect to the creditworthiness or financial condition of Borrowers, the Guarantors or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or the value of the Collateral or any other assets of any Borrower, any Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such information and documents as it has 168 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, based upon such information and documents as it deems appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Administrative Agent&#8217;s Special Counsel has only represented Administrative Agent and KeyBank in connection with the Loan Documents and the only attorney client relationship or duty of care is between Administrative Agent&#8217;s Special Counsel and Administrative Agent or KeyBank. Revolving Agent and each Lender has been independently represented by separate counsel on all matters regarding the Loan Documents and the granting and perfecting of liens in the Collateral. Section 14.5 Payments. (a) A payment by any Borrower or any Guarantor to Administrative Agent hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents for the account of any Lender shall constitute a payment to such Lender.  Administrative Agent agrees to distribute to each Lender not later than one (1) Business Day after Administrative Agent&#8217;s receipt of good funds, determined in accordance with Administrative Agent&#8217;s customary practices, such Lender&#8217;s pro rata share of payments received by Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in any of the other Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, each payment by Borrowers hereunder shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.12(d). (b) If in the opinion of Administrative Agent the distribution of any amount received by it in such capacity hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the other Loan Documents might involve it in liability, it may refrain from making such distribution until its right to make such distribution shall have been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction.  If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and distributed by Administrative Agent is to be repaid, each Person to whom any such distribution shall have been made shall either repay to Administrative Agent its proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.  In the event that Administrative Agent shall refrain from making any distribution of any amount received by it as provided in this Section 14.5(b), Administrative Agent shall endeavor to hold such amounts in an interest bearing account and at such time as such amounts may be distributed to the Lenders, Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Lender, based on their respective Commitment Percentages, its pro rata share of the interest or other earnings from such deposited amount. Section 14.6 Holders of Notes.  Subject to the terms of Section 18, each Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the absolute owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have been furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent holder, assignee or transferee. Section 14.7 Indemnity.  The Lenders ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent from and against any and all claims, actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses, damages, costs, expenses (including any expenses for which such Agent has not been reimbursed by Borrowers as required by Section 15), and liabilities of every nature and character arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated or evidenced hereby or thereby, or such Agent&#8217;s actions taken hereunder or thereunder, except to the extent that any of the same shall be directly caused by such Agent&#8217;s willful misconduct or gross negligence as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction after the expiration of all 169 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 applicable appeal periods.  The agreements in this Section 14.7 shall survive the payment of all amounts payable under the Loan Documents. Section 14.8 Agents as Lenders.  In its individual capacity, each of KeyBank and CIT Bank, N.A. shall have the same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect to its Commitments and the Loans made by it, and as the holder of any of the Notes as it would have were it not also an Agent. Section 14.9 Resignation.  Any Agent may resign at any time by giving at least thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice thereof to the Lenders, Parent and the other Agent. Revolving Agent shall resign in the event neither it nor any of its Affiliates or Related Funds are Lenders.  Any such resignation of Administrative Agent may at such Agent&#8217;s option also constitute, as applicable, Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation as the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender.  Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders, subject to the terms of Section 18.1, shall have the right to appoint as a successor Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, any Lender or any bank whose senior debt obligations are rated not less than &#8220;A&#8221; or its equivalent by Moody&#8217;s or not less than &#8220;A&#8221; or its equivalent by S&amp;P and which has a net worth of not less than $500,000,000.00; provided, however, that Revolving Agent shall be a Lender or a Lender shall be an Affiliate or Related Fund of Revolving Agent at all times.  Unless a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such successor Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent.  If no successor Agent shall have been appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within ten (10) days after the retiring Agent&#8217;s giving of notice of resignation (or the date of Revolving Agent&#8217;s mandatory resignation, as applicable), then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be any Lender or any bank whose senior debt obligations are rated not less than &#8220;A2&#8221; or its equivalent by Moody&#8217;s or not less than &#8220;A&#8221; or its equivalent by S&amp;P and which has a net worth of not less than $500,000,000.00; provided, however, that Revolving Agent shall be a Lender or a Lender shall be an Affiliate or Related Fund of Revolving Agent at all times.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent and, if applicable, the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender, hereunder by a successor Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, such successor Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, and the retiring Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder as such Agent and, if applicable, the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender.  After any retiring Agent&#8217;s resignation, the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as an Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender.  If the resigning Agent shall also resign as the Issuing Lender, such successor Agent shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or shall make other arrangements satisfactory to the current Issuing Lender, in either case, to assume effectively the obligations of the current Agent with respect to such Letters of Credit.  Upon any change in any Agent under this Agreement, the resigning Agent shall execute such assignments of and amendments to the Loan Documents as may be necessary to substitute the successor Agent for the resigning Agent. Section 14.10 Duties in the Case of Enforcement.  In case one or more Defaults or Events of Default have occurred and shall be continuing, and whether or not acceleration of the Obligations shall have occurred, Administrative Agent may and, if (a) so requested by the Majority Lenders and (b) the Lenders have provided to Administrative Agent such additional indemnities and assurances in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages against expenses and liabilities as Administrative Agent may reasonably request, shall proceed to exercise all or any legal and equitable and other rights or remedies as it may have; provided, however, that unless and until Administrative Agent 170 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 shall have received such directions, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, to the extent permitted by the Loan Documents, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Lenders.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Administrative Agent reasonably determines payment is in the best interest of all the Lenders, Administrative Agent may without the approval of the Lenders pay taxes and insurance premiums and spend money for maintenance, repairs or other expenses which may be necessary to be incurred, and Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter notify the Lenders of such action.  Each Lender shall, within thirty (30) days of request therefor, pay to Administrative Agent its Commitment Percentages of the reasonable costs incurred by Administrative Agent in taking any such actions hereunder to the extent that such costs shall not be promptly reimbursed to Administrative Agent by Borrowers or the Guarantors or out of the Collateral within such period.  The Majority Lenders may direct Administrative Agent in writing as to the method and the extent of any such exercise, the Lenders hereby agreeing to indemnify and hold Administrative Agent harmless in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages from all liabilities incurred in respect of all actions taken or omitted in accordance with such directions, provided that Administrative Agent need not comply with any such direction to the extent that Administrative Agent reasonably believes Administrative Agent&#8217;s compliance with such direction to be unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction or commercially unreasonable under the UCC as enacted in any applicable jurisdiction. Section 14.11 Request for Agent Action.  Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledge that in the event that Administrative Agent is the beneficiary of a Mortgage, (a) in the ordinary course of business of Borrowers, Borrowers will enter into leases or rental agreements covering Collateral Properties that may require the execution of a subordination, attornment and non-disturbance agreement in favor of the tenant thereunder, (b) in the ordinary course of business of Borrowers, Real Estate may be subject to a Taking, or (c) in the ordinary course of business of Borrowers, any Borrower may desire to enter into easements or other agreements affecting the Collateral Properties, or take other actions or enter into other agreements in the ordinary course of business (including Leases) which similarly require the consent, approval or agreement of Administrative Agent.  In connection with the foregoing, the Lenders hereby expressly authorize Administrative Agent to (w) execute and deliver to Borrowers subordination, attornment and non-disturbance agreements with any tenant under a Lease upon such terms as Administrative Agent in its good faith judgment determines are appropriate (Administrative Agent in the exercise of its good faith judgment may agree to allow some or all of the casualty, condemnation, restoration or other provisions of the applicable Lease to control over the applicable provisions of the Loan Documents), (x) execute releases of liens in connection with any Taking or the land swap described in clause (c) above, (y) execute consents or subordinations in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent in connection with any easements or agreements affecting the Real Estate, or (z) execute consents, approvals, or other agreements in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent in connection with such other actions or agreements as may be necessary in the ordinary course of Borrowers&#8217; business. Section 14.12 Bankruptcy.  In the event a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against any Borrower or any Guarantor with respect to the Obligations, Administrative Agent shall have the sole and exclusive right to file and pursue a joint proof claim on behalf of all Lenders.  Any votes with respect to such claims or otherwise with respect to such proceedings shall be subject to the vote of the Majority Lenders or all of the Lenders as required by this Agreement.  Each Lender irrevocably waives its right to file or pursue a separate proof of claim in any such proceedings unless Administrative Agent fails to file such claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the Lenders requesting that Administrative Agent file such proof of claim. Section 14.13 Reliance by Agents.  Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, 171 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless such Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Section 14.14 Approvals.  If consent is required for some action under this Agreement (including any amendment or waiver of the Loan Documents), or except as otherwise provided herein an approval of the Lenders, the Majority Lenders, the Majority A/R Revolving Loan Lenders or the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders is required or permitted under this Agreement, each Lender agrees to give the applicable Agent, with a copy to Administrative Agent if the applicable Agent is Revolving Agent, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the request for action from such Agent together with all reasonably requested information related thereto (or such lesser period of time required by the terms of the Loan Documents), notice in writing of approval or disapproval (collectively, &#8220;Directions&#8221;) in respect of any action requested or proposed in writing pursuant to the terms hereof. Each Agent agrees to provide notice of the initial request for action pursuant to this Section 14.14 to the Lenders through the use of Intralinks, Debtdomain, SyndTrak or any other electronic information dissemination system.  If such Agent submits a written request for consent with respect to this Agreement to the Lenders and any Lender fails to provide Directions within ten (10) Business Days after such Lender receives from such Agent such initial request for Directions together with all reasonably requested information relating thereto, then such Agent shall make a second request for approval, which approval shall include the following in capital, bolded, block letters on the first page thereof: &#8220;THE FOLLOWING REQUEST REQUIRES A RESPONSE WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS OF RECEIPT.  FAILURE TO DO SO WILL BE DEEMED APPROVAL OF THE REQUEST.&#8221; If such Agent submits to such Lender a second written request to approve or disapprove such action, and such Lender fails to provide Directions within five (5) Business Days after such Lender receives from such Agent such second request, then such Lender&#8217;s failure to respond to such request for Directions within the required time period shall be deemed to constitute a Direction to take such requested action; provided, however, that such deemed approval shall only apply to a request that requires approval of the Majority Lenders and not to any request that requires approval of all Lenders. Section 14.15 Collateral.  Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to hold all Collateral pledged pursuant to this Agreement or any Security Document and to act on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties, in its own capacity and through other agents appointed by it, thereunder; provided, that Administrative Agent shall not agree to the release of any Collateral except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Each Lender acknowledges that the Loans and all interest, fees and expenses hereunder constitute one Indebtedness, secured by all of the Collateral.  Administrative Agent hereby appoints each Lender as its agent (and each Lender hereby accepts such appointment) for the purpose of perfecting Administrative Agent&#8217;s Liens in assets which, in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code, can be perfected by possession.  Should any Lender obtain possession of any such Collateral, subject to the limitations set forth in the deposit account control agreements that are Loan Documents, 172 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 such Lender shall promptly, upon Administrative Agent&#8217;s request therefor, deliver such Collateral to Administrative Agent or in accordance with Administrative Agent&#8217;s instructions. Section 14.16 Borrowers Not Beneficiaries.  Except for the provisions of Section 14.9 relating to the appointment of a successor Agent, the provisions of this Section 14 are solely for the benefit of Agents and the Lenders, may not be enforced by any Borrower or any Guarantor, and except for the provisions of Section 14.9, may be modified or waived without the approval or consent of Borrowers. Section 14.17 Intercreditor Agreements.  The Lenders hereby (a) authorize Administrative Agent to execute and deliver each Intercreditor Agreement on behalf of the Secured Parties and to perform its obligations thereunder and (b) agree to be bound by the provisions of each Intercreditor Agreement. Section 14.18 Release of Collateral. (a) Each Lender hereby directs, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Administrative Agent to release any Lien held by Administrative Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties: (i) against all of the Collateral, upon the payment in full of the Obligations (excluding any contingent indemnification and reimbursement claims not then due) and termination of the Commitments, provided that Administrative Agent has not received a written notice from a Bank Product Provider or a Lender Hedge Provider that any Bank Product Obligations or any Hedge Obligation is then due and payable to such Person; or (ii) against any part of the Collateral sold or disposed of by the Loan Parties if such sale or disposition is expressly permitted by Section 5.3 or 8.8 or is otherwise consented to by Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, or the requisite Lenders for such release as set forth in Section 27, as certified to Administrative Agent by Parent in a certificate of an Authorized Officer. (b) Each Lender hereby directs Administrative Agent to execute and deliver or file or authorize the filing of such termination and partial release statements and do such other things as are necessary to release Liens to be released pursuant to this Section 14.18 promptly upon the effectiveness of any such release.

(c) Each Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party under any Loan 174 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party from any source, against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. (d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender or Issuing Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf)  (such unrecovered amount, an &#8220;Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency&#8221;), upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s notice to such Lender or Issuing Lender at any time, (i) such Lender or Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Loans (but not its Commitments) of the relevant class of Loans with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the &#8220;Erroneous Payment Impacted Class&#8221;) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment  Impacted Class, the &#8220;Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment&#8221;) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement by reference pursuant to an approved electronic platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants) with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender or Issuing Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (ii) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender or assigning Issuing Lender shall cease to be a Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender or assigning Issuing Lender and (iv) the Administrative Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Loans subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender or Issuing Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender or Issuing Lender (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender or Issuing Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

The indemnification obligations of Borrowers provided herein and in the other Loan Documents shall survive the full repayment of amounts due and the termination of the obligations of the Lenders hereunder and thereunder to the extent provided herein and therein.  All statements contained in any certificate delivered to any Lender or any Agent at any time by or on behalf of any Loan Party pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall constitute representations and warranties by such Person hereunder. SECTION 18. ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATION. Section 18.1 Conditions to Assignment by Lenders.  Except as provided herein, each Lender may assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment Percentages and Commitments and the same portion of the Loans at the time owing to it and the Notes held by it); provided that (a) Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists hereunder, Parent shall have each given its prior written consent to such assignment, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and if Parent does not respond to any such request for consent within five (5) Business Days, Parent shall be deemed to have consented (provided that such consent shall not be required for any assignment to another Lender, to a Related Fund, to a lender or an Affiliate of a Lender which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the assigning Lender or to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of such Lender), (b) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all of the assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to its Commitments, (c) each Commitment of such Lender shall be assigned pursuant to such assignment, and such assignment shall assign the same percentage of each of such Lender&#8217;s Commitments, (d) the parties to such assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent, for recording in the Register (as hereinafter defined) an assignment and acceptance agreement in the form of Exhibit M (an &#8220;Assignment and Acceptance Agreement&#8221;), together with any Notes subject to such assignment, (e) in no event shall any assignment be to any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with, or which is not otherwise free from influence or control by any Borrower or any Guarantor or be to a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender, (f) such assignee shall have a net worth or unfunded commitment as of the date of such assignment of not less than $500,000,000.00 (unless otherwise approved by Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists hereunder, Parent), (g) such assignee shall acquire an interest in the Loans of not less than $5,000,000.00 and integral multiples of $1,000,000.00 in excess thereof (or if less, the remaining Loans of the assignor), unless waived by Administrative Agent, and so long as no Default or Event of Default exists hereunder, Parent and (h) if such assignment is less than the assigning Lender&#8217;s entire Commitments, the assigning Lender shall retain an interest in the Loans of not less than 178 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 $5,000,000.00.  Upon execution, delivery, acceptance and recording of such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and all other Loan Documents executed by the Lenders and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder, (ii) the assigning Lender shall, upon payment to Administrative Agent of the registration fee referred to in Section 18.2, be released from its obligations under this Agreement arising after the effective date of such assignment with respect to the assigned portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (iii) Administrative Agent may unilaterally amend Schedule 1.1(a) to reflect such assignment.  In connection with each assignment, the assignee shall represent and warrant to Administrative Agent, the assignor and each other Lender as to whether such assignee is controlling, controlled by, under common control with or is not otherwise free from influence or control by, any Borrower or any Guarantor and whether such assignee is a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or actions, including funding, with the consent of Parent and Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans in accordance with its Commitment Percentages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. Section 18.2 Register.  Administrative Agent shall maintain on behalf of Borrowers a copy of each assignment delivered to it and a register or similar list (the &#8220;Register&#8221;) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment Percentages of and principal amount of the Loans owing to the Lenders from time to time.  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and Borrowers, the Guarantors, Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by Parent and the Lenders at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  Upon each such recordation, the assigning Lender agrees to pay to Administrative Agent a registration fee in the sum of $3,500.00. Section 18.3 New Notes.  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed by the parties to such assignment, together with each Note subject to such assignment, Administrative Agent shall record the information contained therein in the Register.  Within five (5) Business Days after the later of (a) receipt of notice of such assignment from Administrative Agent and (b) a request from the assignee to execute and deliver a new Note to the order of such assignee, Borrowers, at Borrowers&#8217; expense, shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent, in exchange for each surrendered original Note (or an indemnity agreement, as provided in Section 31), a new Note to the order of such assignee in an amount equal to the amount assigned to such assignee pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and, if the assigning Lender has retained some portion of its obligations hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the amount retained by it hereunder.  Such new Notes shall provide that they are replacements for the surrendered Notes, shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the surrendered Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of the assigned Notes.  The surrendered original Notes shall 179 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

Each Lender may sell participations to one or more Lenders or other entities in all or a portion of such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided that (a) any such sale or participation shall not affect the rights and duties of the selling Lender hereunder; provided, further, with respect to Section 4.8, that the participant&#8217;s rights shall be subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 4.3(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 4.3(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 18.1; and that such participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 4.8 as if it were an assignee under Section 18.1; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 4.8, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in Applicable Law that occurs after the participant acquired the applicable participation, (b) such participation shall not entitle such participant to any rights or privileges under this Agreement or any Loan Documents, including rights granted to the Lenders under Sections 4.8, 4.9, 4.10 and 13, (c) such participation shall not entitle the participant to the right to approve waivers, amendments or modifications, (d) such participant shall have no direct rights against the Loan Parties, (e) such sale is effected in accordance with all applicable laws, and (f) such participant shall not be a Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with, or which is not otherwise free from influence or control by any Borrower or any Guarantor and shall not be a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender; provided, however, such Lender may agree with the participant that it will not, without the consent of the participant, agree to (i) increase, or extend the term or extend the time or waive any requirement for the reduction or termination of, such Lender&#8217;s Commitments, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the Loans or portions thereof owing to such Lender (other than pursuant to an extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.11), (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of principal, (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon or (v) release any Guarantor or any material Collateral (except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement).  Any Lender which sells a participation shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of such sale.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant&#8217;s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant&#8217;s interest in such Lender&#8217;s Commitments, Loans, or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. Section 18.5 Pledge by Lender.  Any Lender may at any time pledge all or any portion of its interest and rights under this Agreement (including all or any portion of its Note) to any of the twelve (12) Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341 or to such other Person as Administrative Agent may approve to secure obligations of such Lender.  No such pledge or the enforcement thereof shall release the pledgor Lender from its obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents. 180 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Section 18.6 No Assignment by Borrowers.  No Borrower shall assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each of the Lenders. Section 18.7 Disclosure.  Each Borrower agrees to promptly cooperate with any Lender in connection with any proposed assignment or participation of all or any portion of its Commitments. Each Borrower agrees that in addition to disclosures made in accordance with standard banking practices any Lender may disclose information obtained by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement to assignees or participants and potential assignees or participants hereunder.  Each Lender agrees for itself that it shall use reasonable efforts in accordance with its customary procedures to hold confidential all non-public information obtained from any Borrower or any Guarantor that has been identified in writing as confidential by any of them, and shall use reasonable efforts in accordance with its customary procedures to not disclose such information to any other Person, it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender may make (a) disclosures to its participants (provided such Persons are advised of the provisions of this Section 18.7), (b) disclosures to its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, accountants, appraisers, legal counsel and other professional advisors of such Lender (provided that such Persons who are not employees of such Lender are advised of the provision of this Section 18.7), (c) disclosures customarily provided or reasonably required by any potential or actual bona fide assignee, transferee or participant or their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, accountants, appraisers, legal counsel and other professional advisors in connection with a potential or actual assignment or transfer by such Lender of any Loans or any participations therein (provided such Persons are advised of the provisions of this Section 18.7), (d) disclosures to bank regulatory authorities or self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such Lender, or (e) disclosures required or requested by any other Governmental Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process; provided that, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender shall notify Parent of any request by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof prior to disclosure (other than any such request in connection with any examination of such Lender by such Governmental Authority) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information.  In addition, each Lender may make disclosure of such information to any contractual counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual counterparty&#8217;s professional advisors (so long as such contractual counterparty or professional advisors agree to be bound by the provisions of this Section 18.7). Non-public information shall not include any information which is or subsequently becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure of such information by a Lender, or prior to the delivery to such Lender is within the possession of such Lender if such information is not known by such Lender to be subject to another confidentiality agreement with or other obligations of secrecy to Borrowers or the Guarantors, or is disclosed with the prior approval of Borrowers.  Nothing herein shall prohibit the disclosure of non-public information to the extent necessary to enforce the Loan Documents. Section 18.8 Mandatory Assignment.  In the event Borrowers request that certain amendments, modifications or waivers be made to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents which request requires approval of all of the Lenders or all of the Lenders directly affected thereby and is approved by the Majority Lenders, but is not approved by one or more of the Lenders (any such non-consenting Lender shall hereafter be referred to as the &#8220;Non-Consenting Lender&#8221;), then, within thirty (30) Business Days after Parent&#8217;s receipt of notice of such disapproval by such Non-Consenting Lender, Borrowers shall have the right as to such Non-Consenting Lender, to be exercised by delivery of written notice delivered to Administrative Agent and the Non-Consenting Lender within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of such notice, to elect to cause the Non-Consenting Lender to transfer its Commitments to an assignee reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent.  Upon any such purchase of the Commitments of the Non-Consenting Lender, the Non-Consenting Lender&#8217;s interests in the Obligations and its rights hereunder and under the Loan Documents shall terminate at the date of purchase, and the Non-Consenting Lender shall promptly execute and deliver any and all documents reasonably requested by Administrative Agent to surrender and transfer such interest, including an Assignment and 181 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Acceptance Agreement and such Non-Consenting Lender&#8217;s original Note.  The purchase price for the Non-Consenting Lender&#8217;s Commitments shall equal any and all amounts outstanding and owed by Borrowers to the Non-Consenting Lender, including principal and all accrued and unpaid interest or fees, plus any applicable amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.7 which would be owed to such Non-Consenting Lender if the Loans were to be repaid in full on the date of such purchase of the Non-Consenting Lender&#8217;s Commitments (provided that Borrowers may pay to such Non-Consenting Lender any interest, fees or other amounts (other than principal) owing to such Non-Consenting Lender). Section 18.9 Amendments to Loan Documents.  Upon any such assignment, Borrowers and the Guarantors shall, upon the request of Administrative Agent, enter into such documents as may be reasonably required by Administrative Agent to modify the Loan Documents to reflect such assignment; provided such documents shall not create any new obligations or reduce any rights of Borrowers or Guarantors. Section 18.10 Titled Agents.  The Titled Agents shall not have any additional rights or obligations under the Loan Documents, except for those rights, if any, as a Lender. SECTION 19. NOTICES.

The effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable law, have the same force and effect as an original copy with manual signatures and shall be binding on Borrowers, the Guarantors, Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent and the Lenders.

The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents.  In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. SECTION 25. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL AND CERTAIN DAMAGE CLAIMS. EACH OF BORROWERS, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, REVOLVING AGENT AND THE LENDERS HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY NOTE OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.

EACH BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS SECTION 25 WITH LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT SUCH BORROWER AGREES TO THE FOREGOING AS ITS FREE, KNOWING AND VOLUNTARY ACT. SECTION 26. DEALINGS WITH BORROWERS. Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, each Lender and each Affiliate thereof may accept deposits from, extend credit to, invest in, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor of, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with Borrowers, Guarantors and their respective Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates regardless of the capacity of Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, such Lender or such Affiliate hereunder.  The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, KeyBank or its Affiliates or CIT Bank, N.A. or its Affiliates, may receive information regarding such Persons (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Person) and acknowledge that Agents shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. SECTION 27. CONSENTS, AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any consent or approval required or permitted by this Agreement may be given, and any term of this Agreement or of any other instrument related hereto or mentioned herein may be amended, and the performance or observance by the Loan Parties of any terms of this Agreement or such other instrument or the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or 186 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Majority Lenders; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent Fee Letter and the Revolving Agent Fee Letter may be amended or otherwise modified, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed by the respective parties thereto only; and the definition of Change of Control may be amended or otherwise modified, or compliance therewith waived, in a writing executed by Administrative Agent and Majority Lenders.

The provisions of Section 14 may not be amended without the written consent of Administrative Agent, or with respect to the provisions of Section 14 relating to the Revolving Agent, the Revolving Agent.  There shall be no amendment, modification or waiver of any provision in the Loan Documents with respect to Administrative Agent or the Revolving Agent nor any change in the rights, duties or obligations of Administrative Agent or the Revolving Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document without the written consent of Administrative Agent or the Revolving Agent, as applicable.

Any amendment of any provision of any Loan Document that requires the approval of the Majority Real Estate Revolving Loan Lenders to require a lesser number of Lenders to approve such action, shall require the approval of each Revolving Loan Lender and, in the case of an amendment to any provision of the Loan Documents that requires the approval of the Majority A/R Revolving Loan Lenders to require a lesser number of Lenders to approve such action shall require the approval of each A/R Revolving Loan Lender.  There shall be no amendment, modification or waiver of any provision in the Loan Documents with respect to Swing Loans without the consent of the Swing Loan Lender, nor any amendment, modification or waiver of any 187 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">provision in the Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit or Issuing Lender without the consent of Issuing Lender.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that no Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may be increased without the consent of such Lender.  Each Borrower agrees to enter into such commercially reasonable modifications or amendments of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents as reasonably may be requested by KeyBank and Co-Lead Arrangers in connection with the syndication of the Loans and the Total Commitment, provided that no such amendment or modification materially affects or increases any of the obligations, or reduces the rights, of Borrowers and Guarantors hereunder.  No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon.  No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of any Agent or any Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto.  No notice to or demand upon Borrowers shall entitle Borrowers to other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. SECTION 28. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one clause or provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability shall affect only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction, and shall not in any manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or any other clause or provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction. SECTION 29. TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence with respect to each and every covenant, agreement and obligation of the Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. SECTION 30. NO UNWRITTEN AGREEMENTS. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARE SET FORTH BELOW. SECTION 31. REPLACEMENT NOTES. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Borrowers of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note, and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory to Borrowers and Borrowers&#8217; counsel or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of the applicable Note, Borrowers will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note, identical in form and substance to the applicable Note and dated as of the date of the applicable Note and upon such execution and delivery all references in the Loan Documents to such Note shall be deemed to refer to such replacement Note.  All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Borrowers in connection with the foregoing, including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees, shall be paid by the Lender that requested the replacement Note. 188 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 SECTION 32. NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are made and entered into for the sole protection and legal benefit of Borrowers, the Lenders, Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent, Co-Lead Arrangers and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.  All conditions to the performance of the obligations of Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement, including the obligation to make Loans and issue Letters of Credit, are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of Administrative Agent, Revolving Agent and the Lenders and no other Person shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be entitled to assume that Administrative Agent and the Lenders will refuse to make Loans or issue Letters of Credit in the absence of strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall, under any circumstances, be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any and all of which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Administrative Agent and the Lenders at any time if in their sole discretion they deem it desirable to do so.  In particular, Agents and the Lenders make no representations and assume no obligations as to third parties concerning the quality of any construction by Borrowers or any of its Subsidiaries of any development or the absence therefrom of defects. SECTION 33. PATRIOT ACT. Each Lender and each Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies Borrowers that, pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Borrowers, which information includes names and addresses and other information that will allow such Lender or such Agent, as applicable, to identify Borrowers in accordance with the Patriot Act. SECTION 34. BANK PRODUCT PROVIDERS AND LENDER HEDGE PROVIDERS. Each Bank Product Provider and Lender Hedge Provider shall be deemed a third party beneficiary hereof and of the provisions of the other Loan Documents for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to such parties, it being understood and agreed, however, that the rights and benefits of such Bank Product Provider and such Lender Hedge Provider under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Product Provider&#8217;s and such Lender Hedge Provider&#8217;s right to share in payments and collections of the Collateral as more fully set forth herein.  In addition, each Bank Product Provider, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, shall be automatically deemed to have agreed that Revolving Agent shall have the right, but shall have no obligation, to establish, maintain, relax, or release reserves in respect of the Bank Product Obligations and that if reserves are established there is no obligation on the part of Revolving Agent to determine or insure whether the amount of any such reserve is appropriate or not.  In connection with any such distribution of payments and collections, or any release of Collateral, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due to any Bank Product Provider or any Lender Hedge Provider unless such Bank Product Provider or such Lender Hedge Provider has notified each Agent in writing of the amount of any such liability owed to it prior to such distribution or release.  In connection with calculation of the A/R Borrowing Base Availability, Revolving Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due to any Bank Product Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has notified Revolving Agent in writing of the amount of any such liability owed to it prior to such calculation.  No Agent shall have any obligation to calculate the amount due and payable with respect to any Bank Products or Hedge Obligations, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and payable from the applicable Bank Product Provider or Lender Hedge Provider.  In the absence of an updated certification, each Agent shall be entitled to assume that the amount due and payable to the applicable Bank Product Provider or Lender Hedge Provider is the 189 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 amount last certified to Agents by such Bank Product Provider or Lender Hedge Provider as being due and payable (less any distributions made to such Bank Product Provider or Lender Hedge Provider on account thereof).  In no event shall the approval of any Person in its capacity as Bank Product Provider or Lender Hedge Provider be required in connection with the release or termination of any security interest or Lien of Administrative Agent. SECTION 35. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CONSENT TO BAIL-IN OF EEAAFFECTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEAAffected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEAthe applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEAthe applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEAAffected Financial Institution; and (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable: (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEAAffected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEAthe applicable Resolution Authority. SECTION 36. CONSENT TO AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT. Pursuant to Section 27 of the Original Credit Agreement, KeyBank as Administrative Agent under, and as defined in, the Original Credit Agreement and each Lender under, and as defined in, the Original Credit Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Exiting Lenders) hereby consents to the amendment and restatement of the Original Credit Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and the execution of the other Loan Documents.  The Lenders authorize Administrative Agent to enter into the other Loan Documents.  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that entering into this Agreement, and the other Loan Documents, does not constitute a novation of the Original Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Original Credit Agreement) or a novation, termination, extinguishment or discharge of the &#8220;Obligations&#8221; under the Original Credit Agreement or such other Loan Documents, which remain outstanding as of the Closing Date, and Borrowers hereby ratifies, renews and extends the Security Documents to which they are a party and the liens and security interests created thereby in their entirety, which liens and security interests continue in full force and effect from the original date thereof without interruption, novation or discharge.  All interest and fees accrued and unpaid (determined after giving effect to any payments made to Exiting Lenders on the Closing Date) under the Original Credit Agreement as of the date of this Agreement shall be due and payable in the amount determined pursuant to the Original Credit 190 US_Active\120558968\V-3 US_ACTIVE\122519032\V-4 Agreement for periods prior to the Closing Date on the next payment date for such interest or fee set forth in this Agreement. SECTION 37. WAIVER OF CLAIMS. Borrowers, for themselves and on behalf of Guarantors, acknowledge, represent and agree that Borrowers and Guarantors as of the date hereof have no defenses, setoffs, claims, counterclaims or causes of action of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the &#8220;Loan Documents&#8221; (as defined in the Original Credit Agreement), the administration or funding of the &#8220;Loans&#8221; (as defined in the Original Credit Agreement) or with respect to any acts or omissions of Agent or any Lender, or any past or present officers, agents or employees of Administrative Agent or any Lender, under the Original Credit Agreement, and each of Borrowers and Guarantors does hereby expressly waive, release and relinquish any and all such defenses, setoffs, claims, counterclaims and causes of action, if any. SECTION 38. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT REGARDING ANY SUPPORTED QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for  a Derivatives Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221; and each such QFC a &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
