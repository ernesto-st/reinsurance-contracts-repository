Agreement shall include Loss in Excess of Policy Limits with respect to any Covered Policy. &#147;Loss
in Excess of Policy Limits&#148; shall mean losses in excess of the policy limit, having been incurred
because of, but not limited to, failure by MICO to settle within the Covered Policy limit or by
reason of alleged or actual negligence, fraud or bad faith in rejecting an offer of settlement or
in preparation of the defense or in the trial of any action against its insured or reinsured or in
the preparation or prosecution of an appeal consequent upon such action.

contractually liable to pay had it not been for the limit of the Covered Policy.

manner as other loss adjustment expense.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.6 <U>Fraud</U>. However, this Article&nbsp;11 shall not apply where the Loss has been incurred
due to final legal adjudication of fraud of a member of the board of directors or an officer of
MICO acting individually or collectively or in collusion with any individual or corporation or any
other organization or party involved in the presentation, defense or settlement of any claim
covered under this Agreement.

to be adjudicated, any defense which Donegal Mutual may deem available to MICO, its rehabilitator,
liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense Donegal Mutual thus incurs

and from time to time, the right to offset any balance or amount, whether on account of premiums,
premium adjustments, commissions, claims, Losses, Recoveries or otherwise, due from such party to
the other party hereto under this Agreement. The party asserting the right of offset shall have

such party from the other are on account of premiums or on account of Losses or otherwise. If
Donegal Mutual is required to make a payment directly to an insured under a Covered Policy, no

however, that Donegal Mutual shall continue to maintain its offset rights against MICO pursuant to
this Agreement.
