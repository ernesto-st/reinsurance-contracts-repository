shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of (i) the state
of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or (ii) the liability of the
RSUI Indemnified Party or the Royal Insurer Affiliates Indemnified Party or any
Affiliate thereof under a Landmark Ancillary Agreement, the Acquisition
Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement (as such term is defined in the Acquisition
Agreement).

                                   ARBITRATION

                                       8
<PAGE>

         SECTION 9.1 ARBITRATION. As a condition precedent to any cause of
action, any and all disputes between RSUI and the Royal Insurer Affiliates
arising out of, relating to, or concerning this MGA Agreement, whether sounding
in contract or tort and whether arising during or after termination of this MGA
Agreement, shall be submitted to the decision of a board of arbitration composed
of two arbitrators and an umpire ("Board") meeting at a site in Wilmington,
Delaware. The arbitration shall be conducted under the Federal Arbitration Act
and shall proceed as set forth below.

         SECTION 9.2 NOTICE OF ARBITRATION. A notice requesting arbitration, or
any other notice made in connection therewith, shall be in writing and shall be
sent certified or registered mail, return receipt requested to the affected
parties. The notice requesting arbitration shall state in particulars all issues
to be resolved in the view of the claimant, shall appoint the arbitrator
selected by the claimant and shall set a tentative date for the hearing, which
date shall be no sooner than ninety (90) days and no later than one hundred
fifty (150) days from the date that the notice requesting arbitration is mailed.
Within thirty (30) days of receipt of claimant's notice, the respondent shall
notify claimant of any additional issues to be resolved in the arbitration and
of the name of its appointed arbitrator.

         SECTION 9.3 ARBITRATION PANEL. Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the
members of the Board shall be impartial and disinterested and shall be active or
former executive officers of property-casualty insurance companies, reinsurance
companies, or Lloyd's Underwriters or active or inactive lawyers with at least
twenty (20) years of experience in insurance and reinsurance. RSUI and the Royal
Insurer Affiliates shall each appoint an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators
shall choose an umpire before instituting the hearing. If the respondent fails
to appoint its arbitrator within thirty (30) days after having received
claimant's written request for arbitration, the claimant is authorized to and
shall appoint the second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators fail to agree upon
the appointment of an umpire within thirty (30) days after notification of the
appointment of the second arbitrator, within ten (10) days thereof, the two (2)
arbitrators shall request the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") to
appoint an umpire for the arbitration with the qualifications set forth in this
Article. If the AAA fails to name an umpire, either party may apply to the court
named below to appoint an umpire with the above required qualifications. The
umpire shall promptly notify in writing all parties to the arbitration of his
selection and of the scheduled date for the hearing. Upon resignation or death
of any member of the Board, a replacement shall be appointed in the same fashion
as the resigning or deceased member was appointed.

         SECTION 9.4 SUBMISSION OF BRIEFS. The claimant and respondent shall
each submit initial briefs to the Board outlining the issues in dispute and the
basis, authority and reasons for their respective positions within thirty (30)
days of the date of notice of appointment of the umpire. The claimant and the
respondent may submit reply briefs to the Board within ten (10) days after
filing of the initial brief(s). Initial and reply briefs may be amended by the
submitting party at any time, but not later than ten (10) days prior to the date
of commencement of the arbitration hearing. Reasonable responses shall be
allowed at the arbitration hearing to new material contained in any amendments
filed to the briefs but not previously responded to.

         SECTION 9.5 ARBITRATION BOARD'S DECISION. The Board shall make a
decision and award with regard to the terms of this MGA Agreement and the
original intentions of the parties to the extent reasonably ascertainable. The
Board's decision and award shall be in writing and shall state the factual and
legal basis for the decision and award. The decision and award shall be based
upon a hearing in which evidence shall be allowed and which the formal rules of
evidence shall not strictly apply but in which cross examination and rebuttal
shall be allowed. At its own election or at the request of the Board, either
party may submit a post-hearing brief for consideration of the Board within
twenty (20) days of the close of the hearing. The Board shall make its decision
and award within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing or the
submission of post-hearing briefs, whichever is later, unless the parties
consent to an extension. Every decision by the Board shall be by a majority of
the members of the Board and each decision and award by the majority of the
members of the Board shall be final and binding upon all parties to the
proceeding.

         SECTION 9.6 JURISDICTION. Either party may apply to the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware for an order compelling arbitration or confirming any
decision and the award; a judgment of that Court shall thereupon be entered on
any decision or award. If such an order is issued, the attorneys' fees of the
party so applying and court costs will be paid by the party against whom
confirmation is sought. The Board may award interest calculated from the date
the Board determines that any amounts due the prevailing party should have been
paid to the prevailing party.

         SECTION 9.7 EXPENSES. Each party shall bear the expense of the one
arbitrator appointed by it and shall jointly and equally bear with the other
party the expense of any stenographer requested, and of the umpire.

         SECTION 9.8 PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND WITNESSES. Subject to customary
and recognized legal rules of privilege, each party participating in the
arbitration shall have the obligation to produce those documents and as
witnesses to the arbitration those of its employees as any other participating
party reasonably requests providing always that the same witnesses and documents
be obtainable and relevant to the issues before the arbitration and not be
unduly burdensome or excessive. The parties may mutually agree as to pre-hearing
discovery prior to the arbitration hearing and in the absence of agreement, upon
the request of any party, pre-hearing discovery may be conducted as the Board
shall determine in its sole discretion to be in the interest of fairness, full
disclosure, and a prompt hearing, decision and award by the Board. The Board
shall be the final judge of the procedures of the Board, the conduct of the
arbitration, of the rules of evidence, the rules of privilege and production and
of excessiveness and relevancy of any witnesses and documents upon the petition
of any participating party. To the extent permitted by law, the Board shall have
the authority to issue subpoenas and other orders to enforce their decisions.

         SECTION 9.9 RELIEF AVAILABLE. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent any participating party from applying to the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware to issue a restraining order or other equitable relief to maintain
the "status quo" of the parties participating in the arbitration pending the
decision and award by the Board or to prevent

                                       10
<PAGE>

any party from incurring irreparable harm or damage at any time prior to the
decision and award of the Board. The Board shall also have the authority to
issue interim decisions or awards in the interest of fairness, full disclosure,
and a prompt and orderly hearing and decision and award by the Board.

         SECTION 9.10 CONSOLIDATION. In the event that there is a dispute
between the Royal Insurer Affiliates and RSUI under this MGA Agreement as well
as one or more disputes involving any of the Ancillary Agreements, RSUI, URC and
the Royal Insurer Affiliates agree to consolidate all such disputes under such
agreements in a single arbitration proceeding.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 10.1 COOPERATION. The parties hereto shall cooperate in a
commercially reasonable manner in order that the duties assumed by RSUI
hereunder will be effectively, efficiently and promptly discharged. The parties
hereto will use their best efforts to (i) give effect to the intent of this MGA
Agreement and (ii) refrain from conduct which would frustrate the intent of any
such MGA Agreement. Each party shall, at all reasonable times under the
circumstances, make available to the other party properly authorized personnel
for the purpose of consultation and decision.

         SECTION 10.2 AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER. This MGA Agreement may
not be amended, modified or waived except by an instrument or instruments in
writing signed and delivered on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

         SECTION 10.3 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This MGA Agreement, the Acquisition
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and verbal, among the parties or any of them with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

         SECTION 10.4 GOVERNING LAW. This MGA Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
laws thereof.

         SECTION 10.5 SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this MGA Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms
and provisions of this MGA Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability
of any of the terms or provisions of this MGA Agreement in any other
jurisdiction. If any provision of this MGA Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as would
be enforceable.

                                       11
<PAGE>

         SECTION 10.6 COUNTERPARTS. This MGA Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
shall constitute one and the same MGA Agreement.

         SECTION 10.7 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Chancery Court for the State of Delaware for the purposes of enforcing this MGA
Agreement. In any action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise any claims that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of the above courts, that such action or suit is brought in an
inconvenient forum or that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is
improper. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable
judgment against a party hereto in connection with any action, suit or other
proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or
judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within
or outside of the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award
or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or
judgment.

         SECTION 10.8 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except as set forth in Article
VIII of this MGA Agreement, and except with respect to URC, nothing in this MGA
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this MGA Agreement.

         SECTION 10.9 NON-ASSIGNABILITY. Neither RSUI nor the Royal Insurer
Affiliates may assign, in whole or in part, any of their obligations or duties
under this MGA Agreement.

         SECTION 10.10 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties recognize and agree
that if for any reason any of the provisions of this MGA Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached,
immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in
addition to any other available remedies, each other party shall be entitled to
an injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of any of the
provisions of this MGA Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or
other form of security. In the event that any action should be brought in equity
to enforce any of the provisions of this MGA Agreement, no party will allege,
and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at
law.

         SECTION 10.11 DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive article and section
headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this MGA
Agreement.

Acquisition Agreement, RSUI shall not use the name, trademark, service mark,
logo or identification of the Royal Insurer Affiliates without the Royal Insurer
Affiliates' prior written consent.

article of this MGA Agreement unless otherwise clearly indicated to the

this MGA Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar
import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this MGA
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this MGA Agreement.
The meaning assigned to each term used in this MGA Agreement shall be equally

denoting any gender shall include all genders. Where a word or phrase is defined
herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a corresponding meaning.

of this MGA Agreement; consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of

shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this MGA Agreement.
