If the Issuer shall be required to  issue a Regulation S Permanent Global Note in place of a Regulation S Temporary Global Note,  simultaneously with the authentication by the Trustee of the Regulation S Permanent Global Note  pursuant to Issuer order, the Trustee shall cancel the Regulation S Temporary Global Note in  accordance with its customary procedures and the Applicable Procedures in effect from time to  time.

The Outstanding Principal Balance of each Regulation S  Global Note may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made by the Trustee  on the applicable Global Note or on the records of the Trustee as hereinafter provided in  accordance with the instructions and the Applicable Procedures of the Depositary.

(e) The Notes shall be executed on behalf of the Issuer by the manual, facsimile  or electronic signature of a Signatory Trustee.  (f) Each Note bearing the manual, facsimile or electronic signature of any  individual who was at the time such Note was executed a Signatory Trustee shall bind the  Issuer, notwithstanding that any such individual has ceased to hold such office prior to the  authentication and delivery of such Note or any payment thereon.  (g) At any time and from time to time after the execution of any Notes, the  Issuer may deliver such Notes to the Trustee for authentication and, subject to the  provisions of clause (h) below, the Trustee shall authenticate such Notes by manual  signature upon receipt by it of an Officer&#8217;s Certificate of the Issuer certifying that all  conditions precedent in connection with the issuance of such Notes have been satisfied and  directing the Trustee to authenticate such Notes.  The Notes shall be authenticated on behalf  of the Trustee by any Responsible Officer of the Trustee.

Such signatures shall be conclusive evidence that such Note has been  duly executed and authenticated under this Indenture.  Each Note shall be dated the date of  its authentication.  (i) The Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this  Section 2.01(i) and at the written direction of the Issuer, authenticate the Global Notes and  retain the Global Notes as custodian for and on behalf of the Depositary.

Ownership of Beneficial Interests will  be limited to Participants or Persons who hold Beneficial Interests through Participants.   Ownership of Beneficial Interests will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will  be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary (with  respect to interests of Participants) and the records of Participants (with respect to interests  of Persons other than Participants).  Participants shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Beneficial Interest  in a Global Note held on their behalf by the Depositary.  The Depositary may be treated by the  Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such Global  Note for all purposes whatsoever (except to the extent otherwise provided herein).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of  the Issuer or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization  furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Participants, the operation  of customary practices of the Depositary governing the exercise of the rights of an owner of a  Beneficial Interest in any Global Note.

For so long as a Series of Notes are listed on any stock exchange, the  Issuer shall appoint and maintain a Paying Agent in respect of such Series and a listing agent in  the jurisdiction in which such stock exchange is located.  The Issuer shall cause the Registrar of  such Series (acting as agent of the Issuer, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to keep a  register of each registered holder of each Note in such Series, of the increase and decrease thereof,  and of their transfer and exchange, as well as the Outstanding Principal Balance of, each  Outstanding Note (which, absent manifest error, shall be conclusive evidence of the Outstanding  Principal Balance of, each Outstanding Note) (the &#8220;Register&#8221;).  Written notice of any change of  location of such office or agency shall be given by the Trustee to the Issuer and the Holders of  such Series.

The Issuer may, and at the request of the Trustee  shall, at any time terminate the agency of any Authorized Agent by giving Written Notice  of termination to such Authorized Agent and to the Trustee.  Upon the resignation or  termination of an Authorized Agent or if at any time any such Authorized Agent shall cease  to be eligible under this Section (when, in either case, no other Authorized Agent  performing the functions of such Authorized Agent shall have been appointed by the  Trustee), the Issuer shall promptly appoint one or more qualified successor Authorized  Agents, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, to perform the functions of the Authorized  Agent which has resigned or whose agency has been terminated or who shall have ceased  to be eligible under this Section.  The Issuer shall give Written Notice of any such  appointment made by it to the Trustee; and in each case the Trustee shall provide notice of  such appointment to all Holders of the related Series as their names and addresses appear  on the Register.  (e) The Issuer agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, from time to time to each  Authorized Agent reasonable compensation for its services and to reimburse it for its  reasonable expenses to be agreed to pursuant to separate agreements with each such  Authorized Agent.  Section 2.04 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.  The Trustee shall require each  Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that all moneys deposited with any Paying  Agent for the purpose of any payment on the Notes shall be deposited and held in trust for the  benefit of the Holders (with regard to payments on the Notes), subject to the provisions of this  Section.  Moneys so deposited and held in trust shall constitute a separate trust fund for the benefit  of the Holders with respect to which such money was deposited.  The Trustee may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of  this Indenture or for any other purpose, direct any Paying Agent to pay to the Trustee all sums held  in trust by such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such  Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.  Section 2.05 Method of Payment.  (a) On each Payment Date and each Redemption Date,  the Trustee shall, or shall instruct a Paying Agent for each Series to, pay, to the extent of the  Available Collections or other amounts therefor transferred to a Series Account of such Series, to  the Holders all principal, Redemption Price or Outstanding Principal Balance of, and Interest  Amount (and if applicable, Step-Up Interest Amount) on, the Notes of such Series (and such other  interest as is payable hereunder in respect of the foregoing); provided that in the event and to the  extent receipt of any payment is not confirmed by the Trustee or Paying Agent by 1:00 p.m. (New  York City time) on such Payment Date or Redemption Date, distribution thereof shall be made on  the Business Day following the Business Day such payment is received. Each payment with  respect to any Series of Notes shall be made by the Trustee or Paying Agent to the Holders as of  the Record Date for such payment.  (b) Payments on a Payment Date with respect to (i) any Notes in the form of  Global Notes shall be made by wire transfer to or as instructed by the Depositary (which  such instructions shall be delivered at least five Business Days before the applicable       - 68 -    Payment Date) so long as it is the Holder thereof and (ii) Notes in the form of Definitive  Notes shall be made by check mailed to each Holder of a Definitive Note determined on  the applicable Record Date, at its address appearing in the applicable Register;  alternatively, Holders of Definitive Notes, upon application in writing to the Trustee, not  later than the applicable Record Date, may have such payment made by wire transfer to an  account designated by such Holder at a financial institution in the United States (or other  location agreed by the Trustee); provided that Holders of Definitive Notes having an  aggregate principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 shall have such payment made by  wire transfer to an account designated by such Holder at a financial institution in the United  States (or other location agreed by the Trustee).  The final payment with respect to any  Global Note or Definitive Note, however, shall be made only upon presentation and  surrender of such Note by the Holder or its agent at the Corporate Trust Office or agency  of the Trustee or Paying Agent specified in the notice given by the Trustee or Paying Agent  with respect to such final payment or in the applicable redemption notice.  The Trustee or  Paying Agent shall provide such notice of the final payment of each Note to the Holder  thereof, specifying the date and amount of such final payment, no later than five Business  Days prior to such final payment, except that if the final payment is made in connection  with a Redemption or Refinancing on a Redemption Date, notice of such final payment,  including the date and amount of such final payment, will be included in the applicable  redemption notice.  (c) Any and all payments and deposits required to be made under this Indenture  or the Notes by the Issuer to or for the benefit of a Holder shall, except as otherwise  required by Applicable Law, be made free and clear of, and without deduction for any and  all present or future Taxes and all liabilities with respect thereto, now or hereafter imposed,  levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any governmental authority.  (d) Upon the request of the Trustee, the Issuer or the Issuer Subsidiaries, the  Administrative Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Holder (by  reference to the obligations of each Holder and beneficial owner of a Note set forth in  Section 2.16) or any other Person to whom the Issuer, the Issuer Subsidiaries, the Trustee,  the Security Trustee or the Operating Bank is to make a payment to provide, to the extent  such Holder or such Person is legally able to do so, such properly completed and executed  documentation, information or certification (including, but not limited to, Internal Revenue  Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, W-8EXP and W-9 (or any  successor forms)) as (i) would reduce or eliminate withholding Taxes (including backup  withholding Taxes) imposed on any amount paid or payable to the Issuer or an Issuer  Subsidiary or by the Trustee and/or (ii) may be helpful (as reasonably determined by the  Issuer, the Issuer Subsidiaries or the Trustee each in its sole discretion) for the Trustee, the  Issuer and the Issuer Subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations relating to FATCA, withholding  (including backup withholding) and information reporting under the Code and any other  Applicable Law.  Upon the request of the Trustee, the Issuer or the Issuer Subsidiaries, the  Administrative Agent shall direct a tax advisor to provide a written statement to the  Trustee, the Issuer or the Issuer Subsidiaries as to the source and character for U.S. federal  income Tax purposes of any payment described in the preceding sentence.       - 69 -    (e) The Trustee shall distribute all amounts deposited in the Series Account for  a Series of Notes to the Holders of such Series in proportion to each Holder&#8217;s portion of  the Outstanding Principal Balance of such Series, unless the Administrative Agent instructs  the Trustee otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.  (f) Neither the Trustee, the Administrative Agent nor the Paying Agent shall  have any duties or obligations in connection with withholding taxes in respect of any non- U.S. jurisdiction, except to make payments in connection therewith in accordance with the  written instructions of the Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the  event that the Administrative Agent is explicitly made aware (based on information and  notices provided to it by the Holders and instructions of the Issuer) that the Issuer is  required pursuant to Applicable Laws to withhold amounts of payments of interest payable  to any Holders, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Trustee in writing and, for  each Payment Date (or other date on which a payment is to be made hereunder) for which  such withholding is required, (i) specify the principal, interest and distribution amounts to  be distributed to each Holder (allocated by Holder in the case of distributions to the  Holders) in the applicable Written Notice, (ii) specify how to apply the amount withheld  in the applicable Written Notice, and (iii) provide the Written Notice for each such  Payment Date (or other date on which a payment is to be made hereunder) no later than  10:00 a.m. (New York time) four (4) Business Days prior to the relevant Payment Date (or  other date on which a payment is to be made hereunder).  (g) If the Issuer, the Trustee, the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent  determines that any amounts are required under Applicable Law to be withheld from any  payment to a Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent  may withhold such amounts, and any such amounts so withheld shall be treated as having  been paid to the Person from whom such withholding was made (and for the avoidance of  doubt, no additional amounts shall be paid to such Person with respect thereto).  The  consent of the Holders shall not be required for such withholding.  Section 2.06 Minimum Denomination.  The Notes shall be issued and may be transferred  or exchanged only in minimum denominations of $250,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in  excess thereof, except, in the case of an Additional Issuance for the Additional Notes, as otherwise  set forth in the Additional Issuance Supplement providing for the issuance of such Additional  Notes.  Section 2.07 Transfer and Exchange; Cancellation.    (a) Certain Transfers and Exchanges.  A Global Note and the corresponding Beneficial  Interests therein shall only be transferred in accordance with the Applicable Procedures of the  Depositary and the circumstances described in this Indenture.  All Global Notes will be exchanged  by the Issuer for Notes in definitive registered form substantially as set forth in Exhibit A-1 or A- 2 (as applicable) to this Indenture (each, a &#8220;Definitive Note&#8221;) if (i) the Depositary notifies the  Issuer or the Trustee in writing that it is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its  responsibilities as depositary with respect to the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not  appointed by the Depositary at the request of the Issuer within 90 days of such notice or (ii) after  the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to any Series of Notes the Holders representing       - 70 -    a majority of the aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance of such Notes advise the Issuer, the  Trustee and the Depositary through the Participants in writing that the continuation of a book-entry  system through the Depositary (or a successor thereto) is no longer in the best interests of such  Holders; provided that in no event shall the Regulation S Temporary Global Note be exchanged  by the Issuer for Definitive Notes prior to (a) the expiration of the Restricted Period and (b) the  receipt by the Registrar of any certificates required pursuant to Rule 903(b)(3)(ii)(B) under the  Securities Act.  Upon surrender to the Trustee of the Global Notes of any Series, accompanied by  registration instructions from the Holder of such Global Note as provided in this Indenture (and  any other documentation reasonably requested by the Trustee), the Issuer shall issue and, upon  written instructions of the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Definitive Notes to the  owners of Beneficial Interests therein.  None of the Issuer, the Paying Agent or the Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery  of such registration instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be fully protected in  relying on, such registration instructions as provided in accordance with the terms of this  Indenture.  Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes of any Series, the Trustee shall recognize the  Persons in whose name such Definitive Notes of such Series are registered in the Register as  Holders of such Series hereunder.  Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall be liable if the Trustee  or the Issuer is unable to appoint a successor Depositary.  The transfer and exchange of Beneficial Interests in Global Notes shall be effected through  the Depositary, in accordance with this Indenture and the Applicable Procedures of the Depositary  therefor.  The transfer and exchange of Beneficial Interests shall be subject to restrictions on  transfer comparable to those set forth in Section 2.12 and elsewhere herein.  The Trustee shall have  no obligation to ascertain the Depositary&#8217;s compliance with any such restrictions on transfer or  exchange.  Any Beneficial Interest in one of the Global Notes of any Series that is transferred to a  Person who will hold such Beneficial Interest in the form of an interest in another Global Note of  such Series will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such first Global Note and become an  interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer  restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Beneficial Interests in such other Global  Note for as long as it holds such an interest therein.  Global Notes may also be exchanged or replaced, in whole or in part, as provided in Section  2.08.  Every Note authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or in lieu of, a Global Note or any  portion thereof pursuant to Section 2.08 shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and  shall be, a Global Note in registered form.  A Global Note may not be exchanged for another Note  other than as provided in Sections 2.07(a) and 2.08.  (b) Transfer and Exchange of Definitive Notes.  A Holder may transfer a  Definitive Note only by written application to the Registrar stating the name of the  proposed transferee (and, if applicable, by providing any other documentation reasonably  requested by the Trustee) and otherwise complying with the terms of this Indenture.  No  such transfer shall be effective until, and such transferee shall succeed to the rights of a  Holder only upon, final acceptance and registration of the transfer by the Registrar in the  Register.  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">     - 71 -    Prior to the due presentment for registration of a transfer of a Definitive Note, the Issuer  and the Trustee may deem and treat the applicable registered Holder as the absolute owner and  holder of such Definitive Note for the purpose of receiving payment of all amounts payable with  respect to such Definitive Note and for all other purposes and shall not be affected by any Written  Notice to the contrary.  The Registrar (if different from the Trustee) shall promptly notify the  Trustee and the Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer of each request for a registration of transfer  of a Definitive Note.  When Definitive Notes are presented to the Registrar with a request to register their transfer  or to exchange them for Definitive Notes in authorized denominations that equal an aggregate  equal principal amount of the exchanged Definitive Notes, the Registrar shall register the transfer  or make the exchange as requested if its requirements for such transactions are met (including, in  the case of a transfer, that such Definitive Notes are accompanied by a completed transfer notice  in the form attached to such Definitive Notes duly executed by the Holder thereof (or by an  attorney who is authorized in writing to act on behalf of the Holder)).  To permit registrations of  transfers and exchanges, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, upon the written order of  the Issuer, authenticate Definitive Notes.  Except as set forth in Sections 2.08 and 2.09, no service  charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of any Definitive Notes.  Neither the Registrar nor the Issuer shall be required to exchange or register the transfer of  any Definitive Notes as above provided during the 15-day period preceding the Final Maturity  Date of any such Notes or during the 15-day period after the first provision of any notice of  Redemption of Notes to be redeemed.  Neither the Registrar nor the Issuer shall be required to  exchange or register the transfer of any Definitive Notes that have been selected, called or are  being called for Redemption except, in the case of any Definitive Notes where notice has been  given that such Definitive Notes are to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be  redeemed.  (c) Cancellation.  The Issuer at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for  cancellation.  Each Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee for cancellation  any Notes surrendered to them for transfer, exchange, payment or purchase.  The Trustee  and no one else shall cancel and destroy in accordance with its customary practices in effect  from time to time any such Notes, together with any other Notes surrendered to it for  registration of transfer, exchange or payment.  The Issuer may not issue new Notes (other  than Refinancing Notes issued in connection with any Refinancing) to replace Notes it has  redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.  Section 2.08 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes.  If any Definitive Note or  Global Note shall become mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer shall, upon the written  request of the Holder thereof and presentation of such Note or satisfactory evidence of destruction,  loss or theft thereof to the Trustee or Registrar, issue, and the Trustee shall, upon written order of  the Issuer, authenticate and the Trustee or Registrar shall deliver in exchange therefor or in  replacement thereof, a new Definitive Note or Global Note of the same Series, payable to such  Holder in the same principal amount, of the same maturity, with the same payment schedule,  bearing the same interest rate and dated the date of its authentication.  If the Definitive Note or  Global Note being replaced has become mutilated, such Note shall be surrendered to the Trustee  or the Registrar and forwarded to the Issuer by the Trustee or the Registrar.  If the Definitive Note       - 72 -    or Global Note being replaced has been destroyed, lost or stolen, the Holder thereof shall furnish  to the Issuer, the Trustee or the Registrar (a) such security or indemnity as may be required by  them to hold the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar harmless and (b) evidence satisfactory to the  Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar of the destruction, loss or theft of such Definitive Note or  Global Note and of the ownership thereof, provided that the requirements of this sentence with  respect to any Holder that is a QIB shall be satisfied by delivery of an indemnity of such Holder  in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee and an affidavit of such Holder as to the  destruction, loss or theft.  The Holder(s) will be required to pay any Tax or other governmental  charge imposed in connection with such exchange or replacement and any other expenses  (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Registrar) connected therewith.  Section 2.09 Payments of Transfer Taxes.  Upon the transfer of any Note or Notes  pursuant to Section 2.07, the Issuer or the Trustee may require from the party requesting such new  Note or Notes payment of a sum to reimburse the Issuer or the Trustee for, or to provide funds for  the payment of, any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.  Section 2.10 Refinancing; Additional Notes.  (a) Subject to the remaining provisions of  this Section 2.10 and Section 5.02(c)(ii), the Issuer may issue Refinancing Notes pursuant to this  Indenture, the proceeds of which shall be used to fund a refinancing of a previously issued Series  of Notes or may issue Additional Notes pursuant to this Indenture (an &#8220;Additional Issuance&#8221;).   Each (i) refinancing of any such Series of Notes with the proceeds of an offering of Refinancing  Notes (a &#8220;Refinancing&#8221;) and (ii) Additional Issuance, in each case shall be authorized pursuant to  one or more Trustee Resolutions. A Refinancing shall be effected only following a Rating Agency  Confirmation of the Series of Notes subject to such refinancing (unless all of the Notes of each  Series then rated by the Rating Agencies will be refinanced in such Refinancing) and a Refinancing  of Series A Notes shall be effected only upon obtaining the prior written consent of the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider (unless a Liquidity Facility Non-Consent Event has occurred or will  occur at the time of, or immediately after giving effect to, such Refinancing), such consent not to  be unreasonably withheld or delayed An Additional Issuance shall be effected only following prior  written notice to the Rating Agencies. The Issuer may only issue Refinancing Notes or Additional  Notes if no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing or will occur as a result of such  Refinancing and issuance of any Refinancing Notes or as a result of such Additional Issuance and   issuance of any Additional Notes, as applicable. Each Refinancing Note and Additional Notes shall  constitute a &#8220;Note&#8221; for all purposes under this Indenture, and shall have the class or subclass  designation and such further designations added or incorporated in such title as specified in the  related Trustee Resolutions and in any Additional Issuance Supplement providing for the issuance  of such Notes or specified in the form of such Notes, as the case may be.  (b) A Refinancing of any Series of Notes in whole may occur on any Business  Day after the Initial Closing Date and shall be effected as an Optional Redemption pursuant  to Section 3.11(a).  No partial Refinancing of any Series of Notes shall be permitted.

(b) Transfer of Beneficial Interests in the Same Global Note.  Beneficial  Interests in a Global Note may be transferred to Persons who will hold such Beneficial  Interest in the same Global Note in accordance with the transfer restrictions set forth in the  Restrictive Legend and the Applicable Procedures.  (c) Transfer of Beneficial Interests to Another Global Note.  Beneficial  Interests in one of the Global Notes may be transferred to Persons who will hold such  Beneficial Interest in another Global Note subject to the following:  (i) If a Holder of a Beneficial Interest in a Rule 144A Global Note  deposited with the Depositary wishes at any time to exchange its Beneficial Interest  in such Rule 144A Global Note for a Beneficial Interest in the Regulation S Global  Note, or to transfer its Beneficial Interest in such Rule 144A Global Note to a  Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a Beneficial Interest in  the corresponding Regulation S Global Note, the transferor of such Beneficial  Interest must deliver to the Trustee (A) written instructions given in accordance  with the Applicable Procedures from a Participant directing the Trustee, as  Registrar, to cause to be credited a Beneficial Interest in the corresponding  Regulation S Global Note in an amount equal to the Beneficial Interest in the  Rule 144A Global Note to be exchanged or transferred, but not less than the  minimum denomination applicable to Notes held through such Regulation S Global  Note, (B) a written order given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures  containing information regarding the Participant account of the Depositary and, in  the case of a transfer or exchange pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation S,  the Euroclear or Clearstream account to be credited with such increase and (C) a  certificate in the form of Exhibit F hereto, including the certifications in item (2)  thereof.

(d) Notation by the Trustee of Transfer of Beneficial Interests Among Global  Notes.  Upon satisfaction of the requirements for transfer of Beneficial Interests pursuant  to paragraphs (a) and (c) above, the Depositary shall present to the Trustee (x) the relevant  Global Note from which the Beneficial Interests are being transferred to reduce the  principal amount of such Global Note and (y) the relevant Global Note to which the  Beneficial Interests are being transferred to increase the principal amount of such Global  Note, in each case, by the principal amount of such Beneficial Interests being transferred  (and an appropriate notation shall be made thereon by the Trustee).  The Trustee shall then  promptly deliver appropriate instructions to the Depositary to reduce or reflect on its  records a reduction of the Beneficial Interests, if any, in the Global Note from which the  Beneficial Interests are being transferred by the principal amount of such Beneficial  Interests, if any, and the Trustee shall promptly deliver appropriate instructions to the  Depositary concurrently with such reduction, to increase or reflect on its records an  increase of the Beneficial Interests, if any, in the Global Note to which Beneficial Interests  are being transferred by the principal amount of such Beneficial Interests, and to credit or  cause to be credited to the account of the Participant specified in the instructions delivered  by the transferor of such Beneficial Interests pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.12  the Beneficial Interests being transferred.  (e) Exchange of Beneficial Interests for Definitive Notes.  Any Definitive Note  delivered in exchange for a Beneficial Interest corresponding to a Rule 144A Global Note  or Regulation S Global Note, as the case may be, pursuant to this Indenture and Section  2.07(a) shall, except as otherwise provided by paragraph (f) of this Section 2.12, bear the  Restrictive Legend set forth in Section 2.02.  (f) Restrictive Legend.  Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of  Definitive Notes not bearing the Restrictive Legend, the Registrar shall deliver Definitive       - 77 -    Notes that do not bear the Restrictive Legend.  Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement  of Definitive Notes bearing the Restrictive Legend, the Registrar shall deliver only  Definitive Notes that bear the Restrictive Legend unless, in the case of Initial Notes, there  is delivered to the Registrar an Opinion of Counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer  and the Trustee to the effect that neither such legend nor the related restrictions on transfer  are required in order to maintain compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act.  (g) General.

By its acceptance of a Beneficial  Interest corresponding to any Global Note, each such owner acknowledges the restrictions  on transfer of such Beneficial Interest set forth in this Indenture and agrees that it will  transfer such Beneficial Interest only as set forth in this Indenture.  The Registrar shall not  register a transfer of any Definitive Note unless such transfer complies with the restrictions  on transfer of such Definitive Note set forth in this Indenture.  In connection with any  transfer of Notes or Beneficial Interests corresponding thereto, each Holder or owner  thereof agrees by its acceptance of such Notes or such Beneficial Interests to furnish the  Trustee or the Depositary, as the case may be, the certifications and legal opinions  described herein to confirm that such transfer is being made pursuant to an exemption from,  or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act; provided  that the Trustee or Depositary, as the case may be, shall not be required to determine (but  may rely on a determination made by the Issuer with respect to) the sufficiency of any such  certifications or legal opinions.  (h) Transfers of Global Notes.  Transfers of a Global Note shall be limited to  transfers of such Global Note in whole, but not in part, to nominees of the Depositary or to  a successor of the Depositary or such successor&#8217;s nominee.

Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes of any Series, the Trustee  shall recognize the Persons in whose name the Definitive Notes are registered in the Register as  Holders hereunder.  The Trustee shall not be liable if the Issuer is unable to locate a qualified  successor Depositary.  The Trustee shall retain copies of all letters, notices and other written communications  received pursuant to this Section 2.12 in accordance with its customary procedures.  The Issuer  shall have the right to inspect and make copies of all such letters, notices or other written  communications at any reasonable time during normal business hours upon the giving of  reasonable Written Notice to the Trustee.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Trustee nor any  Authorized Agent shall have any obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to  compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law  with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Note (including any transfers between or among  participants or indirect participants in any Global Note or any restrictions on transfer imposed       - 78 -    under Section 2.16) other than, in the case of a transfer of a Note to a new Holder, to require  delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required to be  delivered to it by, and to do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of this Indenture, and  to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements  hereof.

The Trustee shall make available on the Trustee&#8217;s Website a copy of each Monthly  Report and Annual Report to any Certified Holder.  The Trustee shall be permitted to change the  method by which the Monthly Report or the Annual Report is distributed to Holders in order to  make such distribution more convenient and/or more accessible to the Holders.

(g) The Trustee shall be at liberty to sanction some other method of giving  notice to the Holders if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable, having regard to  the number and identity of the Holders and/or to market practice then prevailing, is in the  best interests of the Holders and will comply with the rules of any stock exchange on which  any Notes are listed as confirmed by the listing agent for such stock exchange or such other       - 80 -    stock exchange (if any) on which the Notes are then listed, and any such notice shall be  deemed to have been given on such date as the Trustee may approve; provided that notice  of such method is given to the Holders in such manner as the Trustee shall require.

Section 2.16 Holder Covenants.  (a) Each Holder and beneficial owner of a Note, by the acceptance of such Note  or acquisition of any beneficial interest therein, covenants and agrees, for the benefit of the Issuer,  that it will treat such Note as indebtedness for all purposes and will not take any action contrary to  such characterization, including filing any tax returns or financial statements inconsistent  therewith.

(c) Each Holder and beneficial owner of a Note, by the acceptance of such Note  or acquisition of any beneficial interest therein, covenants and agrees, for the benefit of the Issuer,  (i) at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law following a reasonable written request by  the Administrative Agent, the Issuer or the Trustee or their agents, to obtain and provide the  Administrative Agent, the Issuer or the Trustee, the FATCA Responsible Officer or their agents  with information or documentation relating to such Person, and to update or correct such       - 81 -    information or documentation, as is necessary or helpful (in the good faith sole determination of  the Issuer, the Trustee or their agents as applicable) for the Issuer, any other Issuer Group Member  and the Trustee, or their agents, to comply with their obligations under FATCA, and (ii) that the  Issuer, any other Issuer Group Member, the Trustee and/or the FATCA Responsible Officer may  (1) provide such information and documentation and any other information concerning an  investment in the Notes to the United States Internal Revenue Service and any other relevant taxing  authority and (2) take such other steps as they deem necessary or helpful to comply with their  obligations (or the obligations of any other Issuer Group Member) under FATCA.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">     - 83 -    Agent shall also establish and maintain any Lessor Account in accordance with Section 3.01(l).   Each Account shall be established and maintained as an Eligible Account in accordance with the  terms of, and be subject to, the Security Trust Agreement so as to create, perfect and establish the  priority of the security interest of the Security Trustee in such Account and all cash, Investments  and other property therein under the Security Trust Agreement and otherwise to effectuate the  Security Trust Agreement (except as otherwise provided herein).  Each new Account established  pursuant to Section 2.04 of the Administrative Agency Agreement shall, when so established, be  the Account of such name and purposes for all purposes of this Indenture.  (a) Eligible Accounts.  If, at any time, any Account ceases to be an Eligible  Account, the Administrative Agent or an agent thereof shall, subject to the Operating  Bank&#8217;s account opening procedures, within ten Business Days to the extent practicable,  establish a new account meeting the conditions set forth in this Section 3.01 in respect of  such Account and transfer any cash or Permitted Account Investments in the existing  Account to such new account; and from the date such new account is established, it shall  have the same designation as the existing Account.  If the Operating Bank should change  at any time (including, any replacement of the Operating Bank for failing to be an Eligible  Institution), then the Administrative Agent, acting on behalf of the Security Trustee, shall  thereupon promptly establish replacement accounts as necessary at the successor Operating  Bank and transfer the balance of funds in each Account then maintained at the former  Operating Bank pursuant to the terms of the Administrative Agency Agreement to such  successor Operating Bank.  (b) Withdrawals, Transfers and Scheduled Lease Payments.  (i) Withdrawals and Transfers Generally.  The Security Trustee shall  have sole dominion and control over the Accounts (including, inter alia, the sole  power to direct withdrawals or transfers from the Accounts); provided that, prior to  the delivery of a Default Notice, any provision of this Indenture relating to any  deposit, withdrawal or transfer to or from, any Account shall be effected by the  Administrative Agent directing the Operating Bank by a Written Notice of the  Administrative Agent (such Written Notice to be provided to the Operating Bank  by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such deposit, withdrawal or  transfer) given in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, the Administrative  Agency Agreement and the Security Trust Agreement.  Each such Written Notice  to the Operating Bank shall be also communicated in computer file format or in  such other form as the Administrative Agent, the Operating Bank, the Trustee and  the Security Trustee agree; provided that, in the case of communication in computer  file format or any other form other than a written tangible form, a written tangible  form thereof shall promptly thereafter be sent to the Operating Bank.  No deposit,  withdrawal or transfer to or from any Account shall be made except in accordance  with the terms of this Indenture, the Security Trust Agreement and the  Administrative Agency Agreement or by any Person other than the Trustee or the  Operating Bank (only upon the Written Notice of the Administrative Agent).  Each  of the parties to this Indenture acknowledges that the terms of this Indenture  contemplate that the Administrative Agent will receive certain information from       - 84 -    other parties to this Indenture and the other Related Documents in order for the  Administrative Agent to be able to perform all or any part of its obligations  hereunder, that the Administrative Agent will be able to perform its obligations  hereunder only to the extent such information is provided to the Administrative  Agent by the relevant parties and that the Administrative Agent may conclusively  rely, absent manifest error, on such information as it receives without undertaking  any independent verification of that information.  The Administrative Agent agrees  that if it is aware that another party has information required to be delivered by such  party to the Administrative Agent to perform its obligations hereunder, but the  Administrative Agent has not received such information, the Administrative Agent  will promptly notify the party who was to provide such information of such failure.  (ii) Scheduled Lease Payments.  Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary in this Indenture, if any Lease Payment is received (i) prior to its stated  due date under the relevant Lease (without regard to any business day convention  in such Lease that would automatically move the actual due date forward if the  stated due date falls on a non-business day) and (ii) prior to the period commencing  on a Calculation Date and ending on the next succeeding Calculation Date in which  such payment would have been received had it been received on such stated due  date (a &#8220;Scheduled Collections Period&#8221;, and such Lease Payment, an &#8220;Early  Collections Period Lease Payment&#8221;), unless a Default Notice has been issued  (other than a Default Notice that has been rescinded and annulled in accordance  with Section 4.02) or an Acceleration Default has occurred and is continuing, such  Early Collections Period Lease Payment shall be held in the Collections Account  until the Payment Date immediately following the end of such Scheduled  Collections Period; provided that, if there is a Designated Shortfall on the Payment  Date immediately following the end of such Scheduled Collections Period, then  such Early Collections Period Lease Payment shall be applied on such Payment  Date immediately following the end of such Scheduled Collections Period (to the  extent of such Designated Shortfall) as part of the Available Collections pursuant  to Section 3.09.  (c) Collections Account.  All Collections (including all Rental Payments and  Usage Fees transferred from the Lessor Accounts, Partial Loss Proceeds and any amounts  transferred from the Security Deposit Account) shall be, when received, deposited in the  Collections Account, and all cash, Investments and other property in the Collections  Account shall be transferred from or retained in the Collections Account in accordance  with the terms of this Indenture.  (d) Lessee Funded Account.  Any Segregated Funds received from time to time  from any Lessee or pursuant to any Acquisition Agreement shall be transferred by the  Operating Bank at the written direction of the Administrative Agent from the Collections  Account into the related Lessee Funded Account.  The Administrative Agent shall not  make any withdrawal from, or transfer from, any Lessee Funded Account in respect of any  Segregated Funds that is contrary to the requirements of the respective Leases as to  Segregated Funds and the requirements of the Security Trust Agreement (including the       - 85 -    agreement of the Security Trustee that it designate on its account records that it holds its  interest in each Lessee Funded Account for the benefit of the respective Lessee in respect  of whom such Segregated Funds are held).  Without limiting the foregoing, no cash,  Investment and other property in a Lessee Funded Account may be used to make payments,  other than as permitted under Section 3.08, in respect of the Notes at any time, including  after the delivery of a Default Notice.  Any Segregated Funds relating to an expired or  terminated Lease that remain in a Lessee Funded Account after expiration or termination  of such Lease and that are not due and owing to the relevant Lessee under such expired or  terminated Lease shall, if so required under the terms of a subsequent Lease, if any, relating  to such Asset, be credited in a Lessee Funded Account for the benefit of the next Lessee of  the relevant Asset to the extent required under the terms of such subsequent Lease and, to  the extent not so required, transferred to the Collections Account.  When and as provided  in the Administrative Agency Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall cause to be  established such additional Lessee Funded Accounts.  (e) Security Deposit Account.  (i) Upon receipt by an Issuer Group Member of a Security Deposit  (other than any Segregated Funds, which shall be applied as provided in Section  3.01(d)), the Administrative Agent shall, or shall direct the Operating Bank to,  transfer such Security Deposit from the Account to which it was paid to the Security  Deposit Account.  Subject to paragraph (iii) below, the Administrative Agent will  maintain Lease sub-accounts allocating the balance in the Security Deposit Account  to each Lease in respect of which Security Deposits were deposited therein,  provided that, if any Security Deposits are required, pursuant to the terms of the  applicable Leases, to be maintained as Segregated Funds, such amounts shall be  held in a Lessee Funded Account.  A Lease sub-account refers to the record  maintained by the Administrative Agent of the amounts on deposit in the Security  Deposit Account with respect to a particular Lease.  Neither the Trustee nor the  Operating Bank shall have any obligation in connection with maintaining the Lease  sub-accounts.  (ii) On each Payment Date on which Available Collections are to be  distributed pursuant to Section 3.09(a), if the Balance on deposit in the Security  Deposit Account is less than the Target Security Deposit Amount, the Trustee shall,  as directed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.08(o) deposit funds  into the Security Deposit Account up to, if applicable, the Additional Security  Deposit Reserve Amount, to the extent of Available Collections as provided in  Section 3.09(a).  (iii) The Trustee shall, as directed by the Administrative Agent (acting  upon the instructions of the Certificate Holders), from time to time withdraw an  amount up to the Available Security Deposit Amount on deposit in the Security  Deposit Account at such time and shall apply such withdrawn amount to pay any  Designated Shortfalls (if any) for any Payment Date, in each case, as directed by  the Certificate Holders to the Administrative Agent for application pursuant to  Section 3.08(d).         - 86 -    (iv) If a Lessee does not have any right to receive a refund or  reimbursement of its Security Deposit, or a Lessee relinquishes its right to receive  a refund or reimbursement of its Security Deposit upon the expiration or earlier  termination of a Lease (including a termination as the result of the occurrence of an  event of default under such Lease), or a Security Deposit is not transferred to the  purchaser in an Asset Disposition of the Asset subject to such Lease or is not  refundable to the Lessee, the Administrative Agent shall direct the Trustee, in  writing, to transfer such Security Deposit to the Collections Account upon such  expiration or earlier termination, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.01(d)  above.  (f) Expense Account.  On each Payment Date, such amounts as are provided in  Section 3.09 in respect of the Required Expense Amount shall be deposited into the  Expense Account from the Collections Account.  Expenses shall be paid from the Expense  Account as provided in Section 3.04.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be  continuing and a Default Notice shall have been delivered by the Trustee (other than a  Default Notice that has been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Section 4.02) or  an Acceleration Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then the Controlling Party  may direct the Trustee to transfer to the Collections Account all or a portion of the Balance  in the Expense Account, after paying any Expenses then due and payable.  (g) Series Account.  The Administrative Agent shall cause the Operating Bank  to establish and maintain a Series Account for the Initial Notes (and upon the issuance of  any Refinancing Notes or any Additional Notes, any additional Series Accounts as may be  applicable for each such Series of Refinancing Notes or Series of Additional Notes) in  accordance with the first paragraph of Section 3.01 for the benefit of the Security Trustee  for the benefit of the Holders of such Series of Notes.  Upon the transfer of any amounts to  the applicable Series Accounts in accordance with Section 3.08, Section 3.09 or Section  3.14, the Trustee on the same day shall, or shall cause the Operating Bank to, pay all such  amounts to the Holders of Notes as of the related Record Date in accordance with the terms  of this Indenture.  (h) Asset Purchase Account.  As and to the extent provided in Section 3.03(a),  an amount equal to the aggregate Cash Payment Amounts for the Remaining Initial Assets  will be transferred from the Collections Account out of the proceeds of the Initial Notes  (after any other deposits or transfer out of such proceeds) to the Asset Purchase Account.   The amount so deposited shall be held in such Account and invested in Permitted Account  Investments until applied as provided in Section 3.04 or Section 3.05, as applicable.  The  Administrative Agent shall give Written Notice to the Security Trustee, the Trustee and the  Operating Bank of the satisfaction or waiver (specifying which) of all conditions for the  payment of the Cash Payment Amount for any Remaining Initial Asset, and no amounts  may be withdrawn or transferred from the Asset Purchase Account with respect to the Cash  Payment Amount for such Remaining Initial Asset until receipt of such notice as to such  Remaining Initial Asset, except as provided in Section 3.04(l) and Section 3.08(i).

The Trustee shall, or shall cause the Operating Bank to, transfer to and  retain in the Collections Account all or any portion of the Net Sale Proceeds  realized from any Permitted Asset Disposition as to which the direction described  in the preceding sentence is not received by the end of the last Business Day  preceding the later of the date of any Asset Disposition and the date on which such  Net Sale Proceeds are received.  For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Issuer  has elected to retain all or a portion of the Net Sale Proceeds of a Permitted Asset  Disposition in the Asset Replacement Account or a Qualified Escrow Account, as  applicable, in accordance with this Section, the Disposition Fee related to such  Permitted Asset Disposition shall be paid by the Issuer on the Payment Date  immediately succeeding the date of such Permitted Asset Disposition in accordance  with Section 3.09.  (ii) The Issuer may elect to apply the Net Sale Proceeds from a  Permitted Asset Disposition deposited in the Asset Replacement Account or a  Qualified Escrow Account pursuant to Section 3.01(i)(i) to the purchase price for a  Permitted Asset Acquisition to the extent permitted under Section 5.02(q).  (iii) At any time, (A) the Issuer may elect to direct the Administrative  Agent to direct the Trustee to transfer some or all of the amounts on deposit in the  Asset Replacement Account or a Qualified Escrow Account, as applicable, to the  Collections Account and (B) upon Written Notice from the Administrative Agent  (1) the Qualified Intermediary shall transfer any Net Sale Proceeds from an Asset  Disposition remaining in a Qualified Escrow Account at the end of the applicable  Replacement Period for such Asset Disposition to the Collections Account on the  next Business Day after the end of such Replacement Period and (2) the Operating  Bank shall transfer any Net Sale Proceeds from an Asset Disposition remaining in  the Asset Replacement Account at the end of the applicable Replacement Period  for such Asset Disposition to the Collections Account on the next Business Day  after the end of such Replacement Period.

(j) Liquidity Facility Reserve Account.  Following the funding of the Liquidity  Facility Reserve Account with a Downgrade Drawing, a Final Drawing or a Non-Extension  Drawing, if the Administrative Agent determines in accordance with Section 3.07(g) that  on any Payment Date after making all withdrawals and transfers to be made with respect  to such Payment Date (and after giving effect to the transfers to be made on such Payment  Date pursuant to Section 3.08(d)), there will be (i) a Required Expenses Shortfall, (ii) a  Senior Hedge Payment Shortfall and/or (iii) a Series A Interest Shortfall the Administrative  Agent shall so notify the Trustee in writing and shall direct the Operating Bank in writing  on such Payment Date to withdraw from the Liquidity Facility Reserve Account the least  of (A) the amount equal to the aggregate of the Shortfalls in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above  (in each case such Shortfalls as reduced by any transfers made on such Payment Date from  the Security Deposit Account pursuant to Section 3.08(d)(i), (ii) and (iii)), (B) the amount  on deposit therein and (C) the Required Amount.  The Trustee shall, or shall cause the  Operating Bank to, as set out in the Written Notice from the Administrative Agent, apply  the amount so withdrawn, first, to the Expense Account the Required Expenses Shortfall  for such Payment Date; second, in no order of priority inter se, but pro rata, (1) to the  Series Account for the Initial Series A Notes, the Series A Interest Shortfall for such  Payment Date and (2) pro rata, to each Hedge Provider, an amount equal to the Senior  Hedge Payment Shortfall for such Payment Date.  In the event the Liquidity Facility  Reserve Account has been funded with a Downgrade Drawing and subsequently the Initial  Liquidity Facility shall cease to be a Downgraded Facility, following notice from the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Trustee in writing  and shall direct the Operating Bank in writing to withdraw from the Liquidity Facility  Reserve Account any Unapplied Downgrade Advance (as defined in the Initial Liquidity  Facility) to be repaid to the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider.  (k) Initial Liquidity Payment Account.  On the date of any Facility Drawing the  proceeds of such drawing shall be deposited into the Initial Liquidity Payment Account  and withdrawn on the applicable Payment Date for distribution, in each case in accordance  with Section 3.14(b).  (l) Lessor Accounts.  All Rental Payments, Usage Fees and other amounts  received pursuant to any Lease or Related Collateral Document shall be deposited into the  Collections Account.  However, if the Administrative Agent determines that it is necessary  or appropriate, including for any tax, regulatory or legal reason, any such Collections may  not be deposited into the Collections Account or another Account for the benefit of the  Security Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties, then, notwithstanding the requirements  of the first paragraph of Section 3.01, the relevant Issuer Group Member may establish one  or more accounts (each a &#8220;Lessor Account&#8221;) for such Collections in its own name (but  subject to the direction and control of the Administrative Agent) at any Eligible Institution       - 89 -    or with a financial institution other than an Eligible Institution to the extent provided in the  definition of &#8220;Eligible Account&#8221;.  For so long as a Lessor Account is an Eligible Account  and all actions as shall be necessary to establish and perfect the security interest of the  Security Trustee in such Lessor Account pursuant to the Security Trust Agreement shall  have been taken, then the Administrative Agent shall direct the transfer of all funds on  deposit in any Lessor Account (other than any Segregated Funds that the applicable Issuer  Group Member is obligated to maintain in such Lessor Account pursuant to the applicable  Lease or other applicable document) on any Calculation Date to the Collections Account,  Security Deposit Account or Lessee Funded Account (as applicable) on or promptly after  such Calculation Date for inclusion (with respect to amounts not constituting Segregated  Funds) in the Available Collections for the related Payment Date, and shall direct such  more frequent transfers of such funds to the Collections Account as are necessary or  prudent taking into account transfers, deposits and withdrawals required or permitted  pursuant to Section 3.04 (and other than amounts not required to be so transferred as  provided in the last sentence of this clause (l)).  If the Administrative Agent reasonably  determines that it is commercially impracticable or unduly burdensome to take such actions  as shall be necessary to establish and perfect the security interest of the Security Trustee in  such Lessor Account pursuant to the Security Trust Agreement, the Administrative Agent  shall direct the financial institution at which such Lessor Account is maintained to transfer  all funds deposited in such Lessor Accounts (other than amounts not required to be so  transferred as provided in the last sentence of this clause (l)) to the Collections Account,  Security Deposit Account or Lessee Funded Account, as applicable, within three Business  Days of their receipt.  The Administrative Agent shall not be required to transfer from the  Lessor Account any amounts, if any, that for local tax or other regulatory or legal reasons  must be retained on deposit or as to the transfer of which the Administrative Agent  determines there is any substantial uncertainty.  (m) Defeasance/Redemption Account.  Upon Written Notice of the Issuer to it,  or a Trustee Resolution provided to it authorizing that a Series of Notes are to be redeemed  pursuant to Section 3.11 (other than in a Refinancing) or defeased under Article XI, the  Administrative Agent shall cause the Operating Bank to establish and maintain a  Defeasance/Redemption Account pursuant to the first paragraph of Section 3.01 for the  benefit of the Security Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties.  All amounts received for  the purpose of any such redemption or defeasance shall be deposited in the  Defeasance/Redemption Account in accordance with Section 3.11 or Article XI hereof, as  applicable, and disbursed therefrom in accordance with Section 3.11 or Article XI hereof,  as applicable.  (n) Refinancing Account.  Upon Written Notice of the Issuer to it of, or a  Trustee Resolution provided to it authorizing, a Refinancing, the Administrative Agent  shall cause the Operating Bank to establish and maintain a Refinancing Account pursuant  to the first paragraph of Section 3.01 for the benefit of the Security Trustee for the benefit  of the Holders of the Notes, if any, to be refinanced.  All net cash proceeds of such  Refinancing shall be deposited in the Refinancing Account and shall be held in such  Account until such proceeds are applied to pay the Redemption Price (including all accrued  and unpaid interest) of the Notes being redeemed until such Notes are cancelled by the       - 90 -    Trustee and Refinancing Expenses with respect thereto (except to the extent the Controlling  Trustees have determined, as evidenced by a Trustee Resolution, to pay the same from  funds available therefor in the Expense Account) and as otherwise provided in Section  5.02(c)(ii).  (o) Additional Cash Collateral Accounts.  Upon receipt by the Administrative  Agent of a Trustee Resolution providing for the establishment of any additional Cash  Collateral Account as an Eligible Credit Facility for the Notes or in respect of any other  Obligation, the Administrative Agent shall, by Written Notice, cause the Operating Bank  to establish (within three (3) Business Days of the giving of such Written Notice) and  maintain such Cash Collateral Account pursuant to the first paragraph of Section 3.01 for  the benefit of the Security Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes and/or the  Secured Parties holding such other Obligation.  All amounts provided in connection with  any such Trustee Resolution for deposit in such Account and all amounts to be deposited  in such Account under Section 3.09 as an Eligible Credit Facility shall be held in such Cash  Collateral Account for application, and all replenishment shall be made, in accordance with  the terms of the Trustee Resolution relating to such Eligible Credit Facility, which Trustee  Resolution shall include the basis of any replenishment of the Cash Collateral Account.  (p) Maintenance Reserve Account.  (i) On each Payment Date on which Available Collections are to be  distributed pursuant to Section 3.09(a), the Trustee shall, as directed by the  Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.08(o) hereof, deposit funds into the  Maintenance Reserve Account equal to, if applicable, the Additional Maintenance  Reserve Amount, to the extent of Available Collections as provided in Section  3.09(a).  (ii) On the Payment Date on which any adjustment in the Maintenance  Required Amount becomes effective or as of which the amount on deposit in the  Maintenance Reserve Account exceeds the then applicable Maintenance Required  Amount (after giving effect to all other payments to be made on such Payment  Date), the Administrative Agent shall direct the Trustee in writing to transfer from  the Maintenance Reserve Account to the Collections Account, for inclusion in  Available Collections on such Payment Date, the excess, if any, of the Balance in  the Maintenance Reserve Account over the Maintenance Required Amount, as so  adjusted (if applicable).  (iii) If (A) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and  a Default Notice shall have been delivered by the Trustee (other than a Default  Notice that has been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Section 4.02) or an  Acceleration Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or (B) all Assets shall  have been sold or otherwise disposed of, then the Controlling Party may direct the  Trustee to transfer to the Collections Account all or any portion of the Balance in  the Maintenance Reserve Account.  </FONT></DIV>

On each Payment Date on which Available Collections  are to be distributed pursuant to Section 3.09(a), the Operating Bank shall, as  directed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.09(a) hereof, transfer  funds into the Series B Reserve Account from the Collections Account equal to, if  applicable, the Additional Series B Reserve Amount, to the extent of Available  Collections as provided in Section 3.09(a).

(iii) After the occurrence of a Downgrade Event with respect to the  Initial Liquidity Facility, if the Initial Liquidity Facility becomes a Downgraded  Facility and is not replaced with a Replacement Liquidity Facility as provided in  Section 3.14(c)(ii) within the Downgrade Period, the Administrative Agent shall,  on the last day of the Downgrade Period, request a drawing in accordance with and  to the extent permitted by the Initial Liquidity Facility (such drawing, a  &#8220;Downgrade Drawing&#8221;) of the Available Amount thereunder.  Amounts drawn  pursuant to a Downgrade Drawing shall be deposited into the Liquidity Facility  Reserve Account and maintained and invested as provided in Section 3.14(f)  hereof.  (iv) If a Downgrade Drawing has been provided by the Initial Liquidity  Facility Provider and subsequently the Initial Liquidity Facility ceases to be a  Downgraded Facility, following written notice from the Initial Liquidity Facility  Provider to the Administrative Agent that the Initial Liquidity Facility ceases to be  a Downgraded Facility, any amounts of such Downgrade Drawing remaining in the  Liquidity Facility Reserve Account shall be reimbursed to the Initial Liquidity  Facility Provider in accordance with Section 3.01(j).  (d) Non-Extension Drawings.  If the Initial Liquidity Facility is to expire on a  date (the &#8220;Stated Expiration Date&#8221;) prior to the date that is 15 days after the Final  Maturity Date with respect to the Initial Notes, then, no earlier than the 75th day and no  later than the 30th day prior to the applicable Stated Expiration Date then in effect, the  Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) request that the Initial Liquidity  Facility Provider extend the Stated Expiration Date until the earlier of (i) the date which  is 15 days after the Final Maturity Date with respect to the Initial Notes and (ii) the first  anniversary of the Stated Expiration Date then in effect (unless the obligations of the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider are earlier terminated in accordance with the Initial Liquidity  Facility).  Whether or not the Issuer or the Administrative Agent has made such request,  the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider shall have the right to advise the Issuer no earlier than  the 40th day (or, if earlier, the date of the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider&#8217;s receipt of  such request, if any, from the Issuer) and no later than the 25th day prior to the then  effective Expiry Date, whether, in its sole discretion, it has elected not to extend the Expiry  Date or has rejected an Extension Request (a &#8220;Non-Extension Notice&#8221;). If the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider rejects the Extension Request or elects not to extend the then  effective Expiry Date, the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider may, at its option in  accordance with Section 3.14(e)(i), arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility to replace  the Initial Liquidity Facility during the period no earlier than 45 days and no later than  10 days prior to the Stated Expiration Date.  If, on or before the date which is 10 days prior       - 116 -    to the Stated Expiration Date, the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider delivers a Non- Extension Notice and a Replacement Liquidity Facility has not been provided, the  Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Issuer) shall immediately request a drawing (a  &#8220;Non-Extension Drawing&#8221;) for the Available Amount.  Amounts advanced pursuant to a  Non-Extension Drawing shall be deposited into the Liquidity Facility Reserve Account to  the extent of the Available Amount.  If the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider does not give  a Non-Extension Notice to the Issuer and the Administrative Agent by the 25th day prior  to the Stated Expiration Date, then the effective Stated Expiration Date shall be  automatically extended to the earlier of (i) the date that is 15 days after the Final Maturity  Date with respect to the Notes, and (ii) the first anniversary of the then effective Stated  Expiration Date.   (e) Issuance of Replacement Liquidity Facility.  (i) If the Initial Liquidity  Facility Provider shall not extend the Stated Expiration Date in accordance with Section  3.14(d), then either the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider or the Issuer may, at their  respective options, arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility to replace the Initial  Liquidity Facility during the period no earlier than 45 days and no later than 10 days prior  to the then effective Stated Expiration Date.  (ii) If a Downgrade Event shall have occurred with respect to the Initial  Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.14(c), then either the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider or the Issuer may, at their respective options, arrange  for a Replacement Liquidity Facility to replace the Initial Liquidity Facility  within the Downgrade Period (but not later than the expiration date of the Initial  Liquidity Facility); provided, however, that the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider  may, at its option, arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility at any time  following a Downgrade Drawing so long as the Administrative Agent on behalf of  the Issuer has not already arranged for a Replacement Liquidity Facility.  (iii) At any time after the Initial Closing Date, the Initial Liquidity  Facility Provider may, at its option, arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility to  replace the Initial Liquidity Facility.  (A) No Replacement Liquidity Facility arranged by the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider or the Issuer in accordance with clauses (i), and  (ii) and the first paragraph of clause (iii) shall become effective and no such  Replacement Liquidity Facility shall be deemed an &#8220;Eligible Credit  Facility&#8221; under this Indenture, unless and until (x) each of the conditions  referred to in clauses (B) and (C) below shall have been satisfied, and (y) in  the case of a Replacement Liquidity Facility arranged by the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider, such Replacement Liquidity Facility is  acceptable to the Issuer.  (B) In connection with the issuance of each Replacement  Liquidity Facility, (x) the Administrative Agent shall, prior to the issuance  of such Replacement Liquidity Facility, have received a Rating Agency  Confirmation with respect to the Initial Notes (without regard to any       - 117 -    downgrading of any rating of the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider being  replaced pursuant to this Section 3.14(e)), (y) all Credit Facility Obligations  then owing to the replaced Initial Liquidity Facility Provider (which  payment shall be made first from available funds in the Liquidity Facility  Reserve Account and thereafter from any other available source, including,  without limitation, a drawing under the Replacement Liquidity Facility)  shall be paid by the Operating Bank upon receipt of a Written Notice of the  Administrative Agent setting forth the amount of the Credit Facility  Obligations then owing to the replaced Initial Liquidity Facility Provider  and (z) the issuer of the Replacement Liquidity Facility shall deliver the  Replacement Liquidity Facility to the Administrative Agent, together with  a legal opinion opining that such Replacement Liquidity Facility has been  duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and is an enforceable obligation  of, such Replacement Liquidity Facility Provider, such legal opinion to be  reasonably satisfactory to the Controlling Party unless the legal opinion of  counsel to the Replacement Liquidity Facility Provider is in form and  substance substantially the same as the legal opinion of counsel to the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider delivered on the Initial Closing Date.  (C) Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses (A)  and (B) of this Section 3.14(e)(iii) with respect to a Replacement Liquidity  Facility, (w) the replaced Initial Liquidity Facility shall terminate, (x) the  Administrative Agent shall, if and to the extent so requested by the Issuer  or the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider being replaced, execute and deliver  any certificate or other instrument required in order to terminate the  replaced Initial Liquidity Facility, shall surrender the replaced Initial  Liquidity Facility to the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider being replaced  and shall execute and deliver the Replacement Liquidity Facility, (y) each  of the parties hereto shall enter into any amendments to this Indenture and  any other Related Documents necessary to give effect to (1) the replacement  of the applicable Initial Liquidity Facility Provider with the applicable  Replacement Liquidity Facility Provider and (2) the replacement of the  applicable Initial Liquidity Facility with the applicable Replacement  Liquidity Facility and (z) such Replacement Liquidity Facility Provider  shall be deemed to be a provider of an Eligible Credit Facility with the rights  and obligations of the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider hereunder and  under the other Related Documents and such Replacement Liquidity  Facility shall be deemed to be an Eligible Credit Facility (and, if so  designated by the Controlling Trustees, the &#8220;Initial Liquidity Facility&#8221;)  hereunder and under the other Related Documents.  For purposes of clarification, an assignment to an Eligible Provider as permitted thereunder by the  provider of the Initial Liquidity Facility or any other Eligible Credit Facility shall not be considered  a Replacement Liquidity Facility; provided that written notification of such assignment shall have  been provided to the Rating Agencies, and the assignee has delivered to the Administrative Agent  legal opinions with respect to due authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability       - 118 -    substantially similar in scope and substance to the legal opinions delivered by counsel to the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider on the Initial Closing Date.  Following any assignment in accordance  with the provisions thereof and in the foregoing proviso, the assignee shall be deemed to be the  &#8220;Initial Liquidity Facility Provider&#8221; for all purposes of the Related Documents.  (f) Liquidity Facility Reserve Account; Withdrawals; Investments.  All  amounts drawn under the Initial Liquidity Facility by the Administrative Agent pursuant  to Section 3.14(c), 3.14(d) or 3.14(i) hereof shall be deposited by the Administrative Agent  into the Liquidity Facility Reserve Account.  All amounts on deposit in the Liquidity  Facility Reserve Account, including any amount deposited in accordance with clause (iii)  of Section 3.09(a), shall be invested and reinvested in accordance with Section 3.02.  Upon  a request by the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider, the Administrative Agent shall provide  the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider with the amount of Investment Earnings held in the  Liquidity Facility Reserve Account as of the Calculation Date.  On each Payment Date, the  Administrative Agent shall direct the Operating Bank in writing to pay to the Initial  Liquidity Facility Provider all Investment Earnings on amounts on deposit in the Liquidity  Facility Reserve Account.  Amounts on deposit in the Liquidity Facility Reserve Account  shall be withdrawn by or at the direction of the Administrative Agent under the following  circumstances:  (i) in accordance with Section 3.01(j);  (ii) on any Payment Date, if the amount in the Liquidity Facility Reserve  Account exceeds the Maximum Facility Commitment, then the Administrative  Agent shall direct the Operating Bank to withdraw, upon Written Notice from the  Administrative Agent, from such Account such excess and pay such amount to the  Initial Liquidity Facility Provider;  (iii) if a Replacement Liquidity Facility is established following the date  on which funds have been deposited into the Liquidity Facility Reserve Account,  the Administrative Agent shall direct the Operating Bank to withdraw, upon  Written Notice from the Administrative Agent, all amounts on deposit in the  Liquidity Facility Reserve Account and shall pay such amounts to the replaced  Initial Liquidity Facility Provider until all Credit Facility Obligations owed to such  Person shall have been paid in full, and shall deposit any remaining amount in the  Collections Account;  (iv) in the event that (x) the Outstanding Principal Balance of, and  accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes have been paid in full or (y) the Initial  Notes are no longer entitled to the benefits of the Initial Liquidity Facility in  accordance with the terms thereof, the Administrative Agent shall direct the  Operating Bank to withdraw, upon Written Notice from the Administrative Agent,  all amounts from the Liquidity Facility Reserve Account and pay such amounts to  the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider until all Credit Facility Obligations owed to  the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider shall have been paid in full, and shall deposit  any remaining amount in the Collections Account; and  </FONT></DIV>

Section 4.02 Acceleration, Rescission and Annulment.  (a) If an Acceleration Default  occurs and is continuing, the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Notes and all accrued and  unpaid interest thereon shall automatically become due and payable without any further action by  any party.  If an Event of Default (other than an Acceleration Default) occurs and is continuing,  the Trustee may, and upon the written direction of the Controlling Party shall, give a Default Notice  to the Issuer, the Administrative Agent, the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider, the Servicer, the  Senior Trustee and the Security Trustee declaring that an Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing and declaring the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Notes and all accrued and  unpaid interest thereon to be due and payable.  Upon delivery of a Default Notice, the Outstanding       - 122 -    Principal Balance of the Notes and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable.   At any time after the Controlling Party has declared the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Notes  to be due and payable pursuant to a Default Notice and prior to the exercise of any other remedies  pursuant to this Article IV, the Controlling Party may, by Written Notice to the Issuer, the  Administrative Agent, the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider, the Servicer, the Senior Trustee (if  not the Controlling Party) and the Security Trustee, subject to Section 4.05(a), rescind and annul  such declaration and thereby annul its consequences if:  (i) there has been paid to or deposited with  the Senior Trustee an amount sufficient to pay all overdue installments of interest on the Senior  Series, and the principal or Redemption Price of the Notes that would have become due otherwise  than by such declaration of Acceleration (including by reason of any Certificate Holder making  Cure Advances as provided in the second paragraph of this Section 4.02(a)), (ii) the rescission or  annulment would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (iii) all other Defaults and Events  of Default, other than non-payment of interest and principal on the Notes that have become due  solely because of such Acceleration have been cured or waived.  The Certificate Holders shall, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, have a period  of 120 days from delivery of a Default Notice to take such actions as they shall deem appropriate  to cure the Event of Default described in such Default Notice, including the making of Cure  Advances sufficient to fund the payment of Cure Amounts, provided that the relevant Certificate  Holders advises the Trustee and the Security Trustee no later than 30 days after receipt of such  notice that it intends to make such Cure Advances.  Promptly upon making any Cure Advances,  the relevant Certificate Holders shall notify the Administrative Agent, the Security Trustee and the  Trustee in writing of the amount thereof and the obligations toward which such Cure Advances  shall be applied at the written direction of the Administrative Agent.  If such Event of Default is  based on the failure to have paid the Interest Amount due on the Senior Series, and so long as the  Security Trustee shall not have instituted proceedings for the foreclosure of the Encumbrances  against the Collateral, the Certificate Holders shall have until the end of such 120-day period to  make Cure Advances in an amount sufficient to pay the Interest Amount due prior to and during  such 120-day period and may continue to make Cure Advances sufficient to pay the Interest  Amount on the Senior Series for up to two Payment Dates after the end of such 120-day period.   Each of the period from the delivery of a Default Notice to the 30th day after such delivery, and  the period during which any Certificate Holders make Cure Advances to fund the payment of such  Cure Amounts after notice of a Certificate Holder&#8217;s intention to make Cure Advances as provided  above shall be referred to as the &#8220;Cure Period.&#8221;  The Cure Period may terminate prior to the end  of the 30-day period described above, if the Certificate Holders at any time advise the Trustee and  the Security Trustee that they do not intend to make any Cure Advances.  During the Cure Period,  neither the Security Trustee nor the Trustee shall exercise any remedies against the Collateral under  this Indenture or the Security Trust Agreement (or any other Security Document).   Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, in no event shall the Certificate  Holders have the right to make any Cure Advance or otherwise cure any Event of Default with  respect to more than six Payment Dates within any 24-month period.  (b) Notwithstanding Section 4.01 and this Section 4.02, after the occurrence  and during the continuance of an Event of Default, no Holders of any Series B Notes shall  be permitted to give or direct the giving of a Default Notice, or to exercise any remedy in  respect of such Event of Default until all interest and principal and premium, if any, on the  </FONT></DIV>

Without limiting the provisions of Section 4.09 and  the final sentence of Section 12.04, no Holder shall have any right to institute any proceeding,  judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, the Security Trust Agreement or the Notes, or  for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:  (a) such Holder holds Notes of the Senior Series and has previously given  written notice to the Senior Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;  (b) Holders of a Required Majority of the Senior Series make a written request  to the Senior Trustee to pursue a remedy hereunder;  (c) such Holder or Holders offer to the Senior Trustee an indemnity satisfactory  to the Senior Trustee against any costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in complying  with such request;  (d) the Senior Trustee does not comply with such request within 60 days after  receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity;  (e) during such 60-day period, the Controlling Party does not give the Senior  Trustee a revocation or direction inconsistent with such request; and  (f) the Senior Trustee is the sole Controlling Party.  No one or more Holders may use this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of  another Holder or to obtain or seek to obtain any preference or priority not otherwise created by  this Indenture and the terms of the Notes over any other Holder or to enforce any right under this  Indenture, except in the manner herein provided.

Upon any such waiver, such Default  shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured  for every purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other  Default or impair any right consequent thereon.  Each such notice of waiver shall also be given to  each Rating Agency.  (b) Any written waiver of a Default or an Event of Default given by the  Controlling Party (along with any other party whose consent to such waiver is required  pursuant to the terms of this Indenture) to the Trustee and the Issuer in accordance with the  terms of this Indenture shall be binding upon the Trustee, the other parties hereto and the  Holders.  Unless such writing expressly provides to the contrary, any waiver so granted  shall extend only to the specific event or occurrence which gave rise to the Default or Event  of Default so waived and not to any other similar event or occurrence which occurs  subsequent to the date of such waiver.  Section 4.06 Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

(iii) The Issuer may enter into, and permit any Issuer Subsidiary to enter  into, any Future Lease for which Rental Payments are denominated in a currency  other than Dollars, provided that, if the aggregate Adjusted Base Value of Assets  on Leases with any such currency is in excess of 10% of the Adjusted Portfolio  Value, the currency exposure shall be hedged in accordance with Section  5.02(f)(iv).  (iv) The Issuer may not enter into, and will not permit any Issuer  Subsidiary to enter into, any Future Lease with any Person that is not an Issuer  Group Member or any of their Affiliates, unless, (A) upon entering into such Future  Lease, the Issuer is in compliance with the Concentration Limits, and (B) upon       - 145 -    entering into such Future Lease (or within a commercially reasonable period  thereafter), the Controlling Trustees obtain such legal opinions, if any, with regard  to enforceability of the Future Lease and such other matters customary for such  transactions to the extent that receiving such legal opinions is substantially  consistent with the customary practice of leading international aircraft or aircraft  engine operating lessors (as applicable) (which, so long as the Servicer is Willis  Lease, shall be deemed to be the customary practice of Willis Lease).  (v) The Controlling Trustees shall review the Core Lease Provisions  annually.  If the Controlling Trustees (acting pursuant to a Trustee Resolution)  determine that the requirement for each Lease to be consistent with a Core Lease  Provision is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Holders,  taking into consideration any reasonably likelihood of risk that an Asset might not  be able to be leased as a result of such requirement, then the Controlling Trustees  (by Trustee Resolution) shall amend such Core Lease Provision.  Any such  amendment to the Core Lease Provisions shall become effective upon (a) signature  thereto by the Issuer and (b) delivery of the fully executed copy of such amendment  and such written consent to the Servicer, the Trustee, the Administrative Agent and  the Rating Agencies, together with a certification of the Issuer that the Controlling  Trustees (acting pursuant to a Trustee Resolution) have determined that the  accompanying amendment amends the Core Lease Provisions only to the extent  necessary for the Controlling Trustees (acting pursuant to a Trustee Resolution) to  determine that it is not reasonably likely that the requirement that a Lease be  consistent with the Core Lease Provisions will result in a material adverse effect on  the Holders.  (t) Concentration Limits.  The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Issuer  Subsidiary to, sell, purchase, lease or otherwise take any action with respect to any Asset  if entering into such proposed sale, purchase, lease or other action would cause the  Portfolio to exceed any of the Concentration Limits, unless such sale, purchase or lease or  other action has been approved by a unanimous resolution of the Controlling Trustees  including the Independent Controlling Trustee and the Issuer shall have provided notice to  the Rating Agencies with respect to such sale, purchase, or lease or other action, provided  that the Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary shall be entitled to renew or extend any Lease to  the existing Lessee thereunder irrespective of the effect of such renewal or extension on  the Concentration Limits (and the merger, combination or consolidation of two or more  Lessees shall not be considered to result in the Assets exceeding any of the Concentration  Limits).  The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Issuer Subsidiary to, (i) lease  (including any renewal or extension of any existing Lease) any Asset to any Lessee  habitually based or domiciled in any of the jurisdictions which are &#8220;Prohibited&#8221; as such  term is described in the last section of the Concentration Limits (each such jurisdiction, a  &#8220;Prohibited Country&#8221;), (ii) enter into any Lease (including any renewal or extension of  any existing Lease) that expressly permits the Lessee to sublease an Asset to a sublessee       - 146 -    habitually based or domiciled in a Prohibited Country, or (iii) consent to a sublease of an  Asset to a sublessee habitually based or domiciled in a Prohibited Country.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, the Concentration  Limits (including the description of Prohibited Countries) may be adjusted by the Issuer  from time to time with the unanimous approval of the Controlling Trustees and notice to  the Rating Agencies.  (u) Appraisal of Assets.  The Issuer will, at least once each year and within  31 days before or after the end of each calendar year, and in any event not later than  January 31 of any such year, commencing in 2024 (such that such annual appraisal shall  be delivered in December 2023 or January 2024), deliver to the Trustee and publish in the  next Monthly Report (with no obligation of review or inquiry on the part of the Trustee)  the Adjusted Base Value and the Base Value of each of the Assets in the Portfolio, based  on appraisals from an Appraiser, each such appraisal to be dated within 30 days prior to its  delivery.  The Issuer shall deliver to the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider a copy of the  appraisal letter from each Appraiser containing the annual appraisals used to determine the  Adjusted Base Value and Base Value of the Assets as described in the foregoing sentence.  (v) Maintenance of Separate Existence.  Except to the extent provided in this  Indenture or the other Related Documents, the Issuer shall, and shall cause each Issuer  Subsidiary to:  (i) observe all corporate formalities necessary to remain a legal entity  separate and distinct from, and independent of, the Servicer, the Administrative  Agent and any other Person;  (ii) maintain its own books and records and bank accounts separate from  those of the Servicer, the Administrative Agent and any other Person except as  otherwise contemplated by the constitutional documents of the Issuer Group  Members or the other Related Documents;  (iii) maintain its assets in such a manner that it is not difficult to  segregate, identify or ascertain such assets;  (iv) hold itself out to creditors and the public as a legal entity separate  and distinct from the Servicer, the Administrative Agent and any other Person;  (v) maintain separate financial statements, if any, from the Servicer, the  Administrative Agent and any other Person, or if part of a consolidated group, then  it will be shown as a separate member of such group;  (vi) allocate and charge fairly and reasonably any common overhead  shared with Affiliates;  </FONT></DIV>

The Issuer shall, and shall cause each of  its Subsidiaries (except any Asset Trust of which the Issuer or an Issuer Subsidiary is the  holder of the beneficial interest) to, have at least one Independent Controlling Trustee.  The  Independent Controlling Trustee of any Issuer Group Member may serve as the  Independent Controlling Trustee of any other Issuer Group Member.  (x) Tax Election.  At all times on or after the date hereof, each Issuer Group  Member that is a &#8220;foreign entity&#8221; within the meaning of Treasury regulation section  1.1473-1(e) shall maintain its status as a deemed-compliant FFI or a passive NFFE (as such  terms are defined under FATCA), and shall identify and obtain any required documentation  and, if it is treated as a passive NFFE, information from its substantial United States owners       - 148 -    (as such term is defined under FATCA) and otherwise comply with the requirements under  FATCA applicable to it so as to avoid the withholding or imposition of tax from or in  respect of payments to or for the benefit of any Issuer Group Member. The Issuer (and each  Issuer Subsidiary that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or  any State thereof or the District of Columbia or that is subject to U.S. federal income tax  on a net income basis) shall take such actions as are necessary (A) to cause the Issuer to be  treated as either a partnership (other than a publicly traded partnership taxable as an  association) wholly owned by partners that are Permitted Persons, or a disregarded entity  of a Permitted Person and (B) to cause each Issuer Subsidiary to be treated as a disregarded  entity of a Permitted Person.  Section 5.03 Operating Covenants.  The Issuer covenants with the Trustee as follows,  provided that any of the following covenants with respect to the Assets shall not be deemed to  have been breached by virtue of any act or omission of a Lessee or sub-lessee, or of any Person  which has possession of an Asset for the purpose of repairs, maintenance, modification or storage,  or by virtue of any requisition, seizure, or confiscation of an Asset (other than seizure or  confiscation arising from a breach by the Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary of such covenant) (each,  a &#8220;Third Party Event&#8221;), so long as (i) neither the Issuer nor any Issuer Subsidiary consents or has  consented to such Third Party Event; and (ii) the Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary which is the lessor  or owner of such Asset promptly and diligently takes commercially reasonable actions consistent  with the customary practices of the Servicer in respect of such Third Party Event, including, as  deemed appropriate (taking into account, among other things, the laws of the jurisdiction in which  such Asset is located), seeking to compel such Lessee or other relevant Person to remedy such  Third Party Event or seeking to repossess the relevant Asset:  (a) Ownership.  The Issuer will, and will cause each Issuer Subsidiary to, (i) on  all occasions on which the ownership of each Asset is relevant, make it clear to third parties  that title to the same is held by the Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, as the case may be, and  (ii) not do, or knowingly permit to be done, or omit, or knowingly permit to be omitted,  any act or thing which might reasonably be expected to jeopardize the rights of the Issuer  or any Issuer Subsidiary as owner of each Asset, except as contemplated by the Related  Documents.  (b) Compliance with Law; Maintenance of Permits.  The Issuer will (i) comply,  and cause each Issuer Subsidiary to comply, in all material respects with all Applicable  Laws, (ii) obtain, and cause each Issuer Subsidiary to obtain, all material governmental  (including regulatory) registrations, certificates, licenses, permits and authorizations  required for the use and operation of the Assets owned by it, including a current certificate  of airworthiness for each such Asset (issued by the Applicable Aviation Authority and in  the appropriate category for the nature of the operations of such Asset), except that (A) no  certificate of airworthiness shall be required for any Asset (x) during any period when such  Asset is undergoing maintenance, modification or repair or is subject to a Part-Out  Agreement, or (y) following the withdrawal or suspension by such Applicable Aviation  Authority of certificates of airworthiness in respect of all aircraft or all engines, as  applicable, of the same model or period of manufacture as such Asset (in which case the  Issuer shall comply, and cause each Issuer Subsidiary to comply, with all directions of such       - 149 -    Applicable Aviation Authority in connection with such withdrawal or suspension), (B) no  registrations, certificates, licenses, permits or authorizations required for the use or  operation of any Asset need be obtained with respect to any period when such Asset is not  being operated and (C) no such registrations, certificates, licenses, permits or  authorizations shall be required to be maintained for any Asset that is not the subject of a  Lease, except to the extent required under Applicable Laws, (iii) not cause or knowingly  permit, directly or indirectly, through any Issuer Subsidiary, any Lessee to operate any  Asset under any Lease in any material respect contrary to any Applicable Law, and (iv) not  knowingly permit, directly or indirectly, through any Issuer Subsidiary, any Lessee not to  obtain all material governmental (including regulatory) registrations, certificates, licenses,  permits and authorizations required for such Lessee&#8217;s use and operation of any Asset under  any operating Lease.  (c) Forfeiture.  The Issuer will not do anything, and will not permit any Issuer  Subsidiary to do anything, and will not knowingly permit, directly or indirectly, through  any Issuer Subsidiary, any Lessee to do anything, which may reasonably be expected to  expose any Asset to forfeiture, impoundment, detention, appropriation, damage or  destruction (other than any forfeiture, impoundment, detention or appropriation which is  being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings if (i) adequate resources have  been made available by the Issuer or an Issuer Subsidiary or the applicable Lessee for any  payment which may arise or be required in connection with such forfeiture, impounding,  detention or appropriation or proceedings taken in respect thereof, and (ii) such forfeiture,  impounding, detention or appropriation or the continued existence thereof does not give  rise to any material likelihood of the assets to which such forfeiture, impounding, detention  or appropriation relates or any interest in such assets being sold, permanently forfeited or  otherwise lost).  In the event of a forfeiture, impoundment, detention or appropriation of  such Asset not constituting a Total Loss, the Issuer will, or shall cause each Issuer  Subsidiary to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the immediate release of  such Asset.  (d) Maintenance of Assets.  The Issuer will, with respect to each Asset under  Lease, cause, directly or indirectly, through any Issuer Subsidiary, such Asset to be  maintained in a state of repair and condition consistent with the Standard of Care (as  defined in the Servicing Agreement) with respect to similar aircraft or engines, as  applicable, under lease, taking into consideration, among other things, the identity of the  relevant Lessee (including the credit standing and operating experience thereof), the age  and condition of the Asset and the jurisdiction in which the airframe that such Asset is  installed on will be registered or in which the Lessee is based.  In addition, the Issuer will,  with respect to each Asset that is not subject to a Lease, maintain, and cause each Issuer  Subsidiary to maintain, such Asset in a state of repair and condition consistent with the  Standard of Care (as defined in the Servicing Agreement) with respect to similar aircraft  or engines, as applicable, not under lease.  To the extent that the Issuer needs to expend  funds to perform maintenance on any Asset, such funds will be withdrawn first from the  Maintenance Reserve Account, the Security Deposit Account or the Lessee Funded  Account (as applicable) and, second, to the extent of any deficiency, from the Expense  Account.       - 150 -    (e) Notification of Loss, Theft, Damage or Destruction.  The Issuer will notify  the Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Administrative Agent and the Servicer, in writing, as  soon as the Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary becomes aware of any loss, theft, damage or  destruction to any Asset if the potential cost of repair or replacement of such asset (without  regard to any insurance claim related thereto) may exceed: (i) in the case of an Engine, the  greater of $1,000,000 and the damage notification threshold contained in the applicable  Lease and (ii) in the case of an Airframe, the greater of $5,000,000 and the damage  notification threshold contained in the applicable Lease.  (f) Insurance.  The Issuer will maintain or cause, directly or indirectly through  the Issuer Subsidiaries, to be maintained with reputable and responsible insurers or with  insurers that maintain relevant reinsurance with reputable and responsible reinsurers (i)  hull insurance for each Asset in an amount at least equal to the Insured Value for such  Asset (or the equivalent thereof from time to time if such insurance is denominated in a  currency other than Dollars), (ii) liability insurance denominated in Dollars (or the  equivalent thereof from time to time if such insurance is denominated in a currency other  than Dollars) for each Asset and occurrence in amounts at least equal to the relevant amount  set forth on Exhibit C for each type of Asset; provided that Exhibit C may be amended by  the Issuer from time to time, provided the Issuer shall give notice of such amendment to  the Rating Agencies, (iii) war risk hull and liability insurance for each Asset in a manner  consistent with the customary practice regarding similar Aircraft Engines or aircraft, as  applicable, of leading international operating lessors of Aircraft Engines or aircraft, as  applicable (which, so long as the Servicer is Willis Lease, shall be deemed to be the  customary practice of Willis Lease regarding similar Aircraft Engines or aircraft, as  applicable, owned or managed by it or its Affiliates) and (iv) political risk and repossession  insurance for each Asset that will be registered, or based in or installed on an airframe  registered, in a jurisdiction in which it is the customary practice of leading international  operating lessors of Aircraft Engines or aircraft, as applicable (which, so long as the  Servicer is Willis Lease, shall be deemed to be the customary practice of Willis Lease  regarding similar Aircraft Engines or aircraft, as applicable, owned or managed by it or its  Affiliates) to obtain political risk and repossession insurance in respect of aircraft and  engines, as applicable, registered (or installed on airframes registered) in such jurisdiction  in an amount at least equal to the Insured Value (or the equivalent thereof from time to  time if such insurance is denominated in a currency other than Dollars).  Deductibles and  self-insurance for an Asset subject to a Lease may be maintained in an amount up to the  higher of (x) $5,000,000 in the aggregate in respect of any one occurrence in respect of  such Asset and (y) the amount obtained pursuant to commercially reasonable deductible  and self-insurance arrangements (taking into account, inter alia, the lease terms and  conditions customarily available to the applicable Lessee, experience of such Lessee, in  the case of each Engine, the type of aircraft on which such Asset may be installed, and  market practices in the commercial aviation industry generally).  The coverage and terms  (including endorsements, deductibles and self-insurance arrangements) of any insurance  maintained with respect to any Asset not subject to a Lease shall be consistent with the  customary practice for similar equipment of leading international operating lessors of  Aircraft Engines or aircraft, as applicable (which, so long as the Servicer is Willis Lease,  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">     - 151 -    shall be deemed to be the customary practice of Willis Lease regarding similar Aircraft  Engines or aircraft, as applicable, owned or managed by it or its Affiliates).  The insurance arrangements required as described above shall include the Security  Trustee as additional insured, in respect of liability insurances, and a loss payee/contract  party, in respect of hull insurances.  The Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts  to cause Lessees to include the Trustee as named additional insured in connection with the  required liability insurance.  The obligation to so name the Security Trustee and, if  applicable, the Trustee shall only apply for one insurance policy and only to the extent of  the coverage required herein, to the extent more than one insurance policy provides the  same required coverage (for example, if both the Lessee and the Issuer then carry the  required insurance coverage) or provides coverage additional to that required herein.  In determining the amount of insurance required to be maintained by this Section  5.03(f), the Issuer may take into account any indemnification from, or insurance provided  by, any governmental, supranational or inter-governmental authority or agency, against  any risk with respect to an Asset at least in an amount which, when added to the amount of  insurance against such risk maintained by the Issuer (or which the Issuer has caused to be  maintained), shall be at least equal to the amount of insurance against such risk otherwise  required by this Section 5.03(f) (taking into account self-insurance permitted by this  Section 5.03(f)).  Any such indemnification or insurance provided by such government  shall provide substantially similar protection as the insurance required by this Section  5.03(f).  The Issuer will not be required to maintain (or to cause to be maintained) any  insurance otherwise required hereunder to the extent that such insurance is not generally  available in the relevant insurance market at commercially reasonable rates from time to  time.  (g) Projected Maintenance Reserve.  The Issuer shall, no later than the  Calculation Date immediately following each anniversary of the Initial Closing Date,  deliver to the Trustee, and the Trustee will include with the next Monthly Report (with no  obligation of review or inquiry on the part of the Trustee), the Maintenance Annual  Estimate.  Promptly after receiving the annual Maintenance Annual Estimate, the Issuer  shall cause the Administrative Agent to prepare, based on the Maintenance Annual  Estimate (in no event later than the third Business Day before the Payment Date relating to  the Calculation Date following such anniversary), the initial calculation of the Maintenance  Required Amount for each Payment Date, which shall be adjusted as provided in the last  sentence of the definition of Maintenance Required Amount.  On each Calculation Date,  the Administrative Agent shall calculate the difference between the Maintenance Required  Amount for the related Payment Date and the amount available in the Maintenance Reserve  Account as of such Payment Date (such difference, if positive, the &#8220;Additional  Maintenance Reserve Amount&#8221; for such Payment Date).  The Trustee shall apply  Available Collections to make a deposit into the Maintenance Reserve Account on each  such Payment Date in accordance with Section 3.09 hereof.  The Maintenance Required  Amounts and Additional Maintenance Reserve Amounts based on any prior Maintenance       - 152 -    Annual Estimate will be recalculated after each annual Maintenance Annual Estimate, as  adjusted for each Payment Date as provided in the definition thereof.  (h) Indemnity.  The Issuer will, and shall cause each Issuer Subsidiary to,  include in each Lease an indemnity from the applicable Lessee in respect of any losses or  liabilities arising from the use or operation of the related Asset during the term of such  Lease, subject to such exceptions, limitations and qualifications as are consistent with the  customary practice of leading international aircraft or aircraft engine operating lessors (as  applicable) (which, so long as the Servicer is Willis Lease, shall be deemed to be the  customary practice of Willis Lease) regarding similar aircraft or Aircraft Engines, as  applicable, owned or managed by it or its Affiliates.  (i) Fees and License.  The Issuer will, and shall cause each Issuer Subsidiary  to, promptly pay or cause to be promptly, paid all license and registration fees and all taxes  of any nature (together with any penalties, fines or interest thereon) assessed and demanded  by any government or any revenue authority (whether of the applicable country of  registration of the Asset or otherwise), upon or with respect to any Assets or upon the  purchase, ownership, delivery, leasing, possession, use, operation, return, sale or other  disposition thereof or rentals, income or proceeds received with respect thereto.  (j) Website.  To the extent required by a Rating Agency, the Issuer will cause  the Administrative Agent to maintain or cause to be maintained a password protected  Internet website (the &#8220;Website&#8221;) containing (i) the Monthly Reports and Annual Reports  and (ii) all information the Issuer provides, or contracts with a third party to provide, to  any Rating Agency for the purpose of undertaking credit rating surveillance on the Notes.   In furtherance of the foregoing, the Issuer agrees, to the extent required by a Rating  Agency, it shall cause each notice or other information required hereby to be given by the  Issuer to any Rating Agency to be delivered to such Rating Agency by the Administrative  Agent on behalf of the Issuer and the Administrative Agent shall post such notice or other  information to the Website.  Section 5.04 Compliance Through Agents.  The Issuer shall be entitled to delegate the  performance of any of its covenants hereunder to one or more Service Providers pursuant to one  or more Related Documents entered into in accordance with the terms of this Indenture so long as  each such Related Document is subject to the Encumbrance of the Security Trust Agreement.   Nothing in this Section 5.04 is intended to, or shall, relieve the Issuer from any liability or  consequences hereunder arising from the failure of the Issuer or any such Service Provider to  perform any such covenant strictly in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.  ARTICLE VI    THE TRUSTEE  Section 6.01 Acceptance of Trusts and Duties.  The duties and responsibilities of the  Trustee shall be as expressly set forth herein.  The Trustee accepts the trusts hereby created and  applicable to it and agrees to perform the same but only upon the terms of this Indenture and agrees  to receive and disburse all moneys received by it in accordance with the terms hereof.  The Trustee       - 153 -    in its individual capacity shall not be answerable or accountable under any circumstances, except  for its own willful misconduct or negligence or breach of any of its representations and warranties  set forth herein, and the Trustee shall not be liable for any action or inaction of the Issuer or any  other parties to any of the Related Documents.  The fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Trustee  shall be Expenses of the Issuer.  Section 6.02 Absence of Duties.  The Trustee shall have no duty to ascertain or inquire  as to the performance or observance of any covenants, conditions or agreements on the part of any  Lessee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee, upon written request, shall furnish to any  Holder, promptly upon receipt thereof, duplicates or copies of all reports, Notices, financial  statements and other instruments furnished to the Trustee under this Indenture.  Section 6.03 Representations or Warranties.  The Trustee does not make and shall not be  deemed to have made any representation or warranty as to the validity, legality or enforceability  of this Indenture, the Notes, any other securities or any other document or instrument or as to the  correctness of any statement contained in any thereof, except that the Trustee in its individual  capacity hereby represents and warrants (i) that each such specified document to which it is a party  has been or will be duly executed and delivered by one of its officers who is and will be duly  authorized to execute and deliver such document on its behalf, and (ii) this Indenture is the legal,  valid and binding obligation of the Trustee, enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its  terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium  or similar law affecting creditors&#8217; rights generally.  Section 6.04 Reliance; Agents; Advice of Counsel.  The Trustee may conclusively rely  and shall be fully protected and incur no liability to anyone in acting or refraining from acting  upon any signature, instrument, notice, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report,  opinion, bond or other document or paper believed by it to be genuine and believed by it to be  signed (or if provided by electronic means, sent) by the proper party or parties.  The Trustee shall  have no obligation to confirm the veracity of the content of any such item provided to it (absent  manifest error).  The Trustee may accept a copy of a resolution of, in the case of the Issuer, the  Controlling Trustees and, in the case of any other party to any Related Document, the governing  body of such Person, certified in an accompanying Officer&#8217;s Certificate as duly adopted and in full  force and effect, as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted and that the  same is in full force and effect.  As to any fact or matter the manner of ascertainment of which is  not specifically described herein, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and may for all purposes  hereof conclusively rely on a certificate, signed by an officer of any duly authorized Person, as to  such fact or matter, and such certificate shall constitute full protection to the Trustee for any action  taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon.  The Trustee shall furnish to  the Administrative Agent upon written request such information and copies of such documents as  the Trustee may have and as are necessary for the Administrative Agent to perform its duties  hereunder.  The Trustee shall assume, and shall be fully protected in assuming, that the Issuer is  authorized by its constitutional documents to enter into this Indenture and to take all action  permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions hereof, and shall not inquire into the  authorization of the Issuer with respect thereto.  The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith that it  reasonably believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers or for any action it takes or       - 154 -    omits to take in accordance with the direction of the Controlling Party or any Holder, in accordance  with the terms of this Indenture, including, without limitation, Section 4.12 relating to the time,  method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or  exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.  The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties  hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys or a custodian or nominee, and the  Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of, or for the  supervision of, any such agent, attorney, custodian or nominee appointed with due care by it  hereunder.  The Trustee may consult with counsel as to any matter relating to this Indenture and any  Opinion of Counsel or any advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and  protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and  in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel.  The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in  it by this Indenture, or to institute, conduct or defend any litigation hereunder or in relation hereto,  at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture,  unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against  the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be Incurred therein or thereby.  The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise Incur any  financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its  rights or powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or  adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it, and none of the  provisions contained in this Indenture shall in any event require the Trustee to perform, or be  responsible or liable for the manner of performance of, any obligations of the Issuer or the  Administrative Agent under this Indenture or any of the other Related Documents.  The Trustee shall not be liable for any Costs or Taxes (except for Taxes relating to any  compensation, fees or commissions of any entity acting in its capacity as Trustee hereunder) or in  connection with the selection of Permitted Account Investments or for any investment losses  resulting from Permitted Account Investments.  When the Trustee Incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Acceleration  Default, such expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for  such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law or  law relating to creditors&#8217; rights generally.  The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of an Event of Default unless a  Responsible Officer of the Trustee obtains actual knowledge of such event, including receiving  Written Notice of such event from the Issuer, the Administrative Agent, the Controlling Party or  Holders of Notes aggregating not less than 10% of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Notes.  The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the performance of the Issuer, the Administrative  Agent or any other party to the Related Documents, nor shall it have any liability in connection  </FONT></DIV>

The Trustee shall notify the Issuer, the Holders, the Initial Liquidity Facility       - 161 -    Provider and the Rating Agencies promptly of any claim asserted against the Trustee for which it  may seek indemnity; provided, however, that failure to provide such notice shall not invalidate any  right to indemnity hereunder.  The Issuer shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in  the defense.  The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Issuer shall pay reasonable fees and  expenses of such counsel.  The Issuer need not pay for any settlement made without its consent;  provided that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  In no event shall the  Issuer settle or compromise a claim against the Trustee (or its directors, employees, representatives  or agents) on behalf of the Trustee (or its directors, employees, representatives or agents) without  the consent of the Trustee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Issuer  need not reimburse any expense or indemnity against any loss or liability Incurred by the Trustee  through willful misconduct or negligence.    Section 8.02 Holders&#8217; Indemnity.

Any failure of the Issuer to provide  such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of  any such amendment, modification or waiver.  After an amendment under this Section 9.01 becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder  whether or not notation thereof is made on any Note held by such Holder.  This Section 9.01 shall not limit the ability of (and no consent under this Section  9.01shall be required for) the Issuer to amend or modify this Indenture to provide for the  issuance of Additional Notes otherwise permitted under this Indenture.

Section 11.05 Indemnity for Government Obligations.  The Issuer shall pay and shall  indemnify the Trustee against any Tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against       - 168 -    deposited U.S. Government Obligations, or the principal and interest received on such  U.S. Government Obligations.

Section 12.02 Waiver.  Any waiver by any party of any provision of this Indenture or any  right, remedy or option hereunder shall only prevent and estop such party from thereafter enforcing  such provision, right, remedy or option if such waiver is given in writing and only as to the specific  instance and for the specific purpose for which such waiver was given.  The failure or refusal of  any party hereto to insist in any one or more instances, or in a course of dealing, upon the strict  performance of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture by any party hereto or the partial  exercise of any right, remedy or option hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver or  relinquishment of any such term or provision, but the same shall continue in full force and effect.   No failure on the part of the Trustee to exercise, and no delay on its part in exercising, any right  or remedy under this Indenture will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial  exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of  any other right or remedy.  The rights and remedies provided in this Indenture are cumulative and  not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or in any other Related Document.  Section 12.03 Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Indenture or the  application thereof to any party hereto or to any circumstance or in any jurisdiction governing this  Indenture shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute, regulation  or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it is invalid or  unenforceable and the remainder of this Indenture, and the application of any such invalid or  unenforceable provision to the parties, jurisdictions or circumstances other than to whom or to       - 169 -    which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby nor shall the same affect the  validity or enforceability of this Indenture.  The parties hereto further agree that the holding by  any court of competent jurisdiction that any remedy pursued by the Trustee hereunder is  unavailable or unenforceable shall not affect in any way the ability of the Trustee to pursue any  other remedy available to it.

The Trustee and, during the  continuance of a payment Default with respect to the Senior Series, the Senior Trustee, in its  capacity as trustee of such Senior Series, except as otherwise provided in Section 4.04, may sue  for recovery or take any other steps for the purpose of recovering any of the obligations hereunder  or any other debts or liabilities whatsoever owing to it by the Issuer.

This Indenture shall be a continuing  obligation of the Issuer and shall (a) be binding upon the Issuer and its successors and assigns and  (b) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the Operating Bank, the  Administrative Agent and the Initial Liquidity Facility Provider, and by their respective  successors, transferees and assigns.

When a Definitive  Note is presented to the Registrar with a request to register the transfer or to exchange it for Series  B Notes of authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the exchanged  Notes, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its requirements  for such transactions are met (including, in the case of a transfer, that such Definitive Note is  accompanied by a completed transfer notice in the form attached to this Note (if this Note is a  Definitive Note) duly executed by the Holder hereof (or by an attorney who is authorized in writing  to act on behalf of the Holder)).  No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer  or exchange of a Definitive Note, but the party requesting such new Note or Notes may be required  to pay a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in  connection therewith.  Prior to the registration of transfer of a Definitive Note, the Issuer and the Trustee may deem and  treat the Person in whose name this Note (as of the day of determination or as of such other date  as may be specified in the Indenture) is registered as the absolute owner and holder hereof for the  purpose of receiving payment of all amounts payable with respect to this Note and for all other  purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.  Article IX of the Indenture permits the amendment, modification or waiver of the Indenture and  the Series B Notes, as specified in the Indenture.  The Indenture also contains provisions that  permit waiver of compliance by the Issuer with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain  existing defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.
