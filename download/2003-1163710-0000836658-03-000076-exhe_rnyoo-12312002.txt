                                 COST ALLOCATION

Services  performed under this Management  Services Agreement shall be performed
for the costs set forth as follows:

          A.   Direct costs  incurred by SCL in providing  the Services' and the
               cost of  materials  purchased  for the  benefit  of RLNY shall be
               reimbursed by RLNY at such cost.

          B.   Costs  incurred by the SCL service  areas,  which  allocate  cost
               among the various  users of such  services in  proportion  to the
               services  actually  rendered  to each user,  shall be  determined
               monthly  by the  appropriate  SCL  servicing  unit  based  on the
               assessment of a mutually  agreed upon  operational or maintenance
               servicing unit cost  multiplied by the number of hours billed to,
               or the volume of activity  incurred by, SCL service  areas.  Such
               costs shall be  reimbursed  by RLNY during the month for Services
               rendered.

The  determination of charges  hereunder by SCL shall be presented to RLNY, and,
if RLNY objects to any such determination,  it shall so advise SCL within thirty
(30) days of receipt of notice of said  determination.  Unless the  parties  can
reconcile  any such  objection,  they shall agree to the  selection of a firm of
independent  certified  public  accountants  which shall  determine  the charges
properly  allocable  to RLNY and shall,  within a reasonable  time,  submit such
determination,  together  with the basis  therefor,  in writing to SCL and RLNY,
whereupon  such  determination  shall  be  binding.   The  expenses  of  such  a
determination  by a firm of  independent  certified  accountants  shall be borne
equally by SCL and RLNY

SCL shall from time to time perform cost  analysis to  determine,  as closely as
possible,  the actual cost of services  rendered and  facilities  made available
pursuant  to this  Management  Services  Agreement.  SCL shall  forward  to RLNY
information  developed by these analyses,  and such information shall be used to
develop bases for the  distribution  of expenses  which more  currently  reflect
actual costs incurred.
