HEALTH AND WELFARE PLAN</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Effective April 1, 2003)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WCTOCLevel1Mark1in5g_01">INTRODUCTION</A></P>
</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minerals Technologies Inc. hereby establishes the Minerals Technologies Inc. Health and Welfare Plan (hereinafter the "Welfare Plan"), effective April 1, 2003, to provide health and welfare benefits for the Eligible Employees of Minerals Technologies Inc. and participating Affiliates. The Welfare Plan includes and encompasses: (i) the Minerals Technologies Inc. Flexible Benefits Plan (the "Cafeteria Program"), which in turn includes the Premium Conversion Program benefit component, covering Eligible Employees of Minerals Technologies Inc.; and (ii) each of the individual plans, programs, insurance contracts, and benefit components that are listed in Appendix A (collectively, with the Cafeteria Program, hereinafter referred to as "Benefit Components"), and the terms of each such Benefit Component are hereby incorporated into the Welfare Plan by reference.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>THE WELFARE PLAN, TOGETHER WITH EACH BENEFIT COMPONENT FORMING A PART OF THE WELFARE PLAN, CONSTITUTES THE WRITTEN PLAN DOCUMENT FOR THE MINERALS TECHNOLOGIES INC. HEALTH AND WELFARE PLAN.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In the event that any term or provision in the Welfare Plan document is in conflict with any of the terms or provisions of any Benefit Component, the terms or provisions in the Welfare Plan document will govern. Where terms and provisions specifically applicable to an individual Benefit Component are not addressed in the Welfare Plan document, such terms and provisions as set forth in such Benefit Component will govern.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Welfare Plan is designed to meet the applicable requirements of the Code, ERISA, COBRA, HIPAA, the ADA, the FMLA, the USERRA, and any other applicable law, including regulations and rulings issued pursuant to any such laws, to the extent applicable to a Benefit Component. The Welfare Plan is specifically designated as a welfare benefit plan under ERISA, and shall be treated as a single welfare benefit plan for purposes of the reporting requirements under Title I of ERISA. However, to the extent permitted by Title I of ERISA, an Employer may elect to satisfy the summary plan description and summary of material modifications requirements of ERISA separately with respect to any one or more of the Benefit Components. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each individual Benefit Component shall be subject to ERISA only to the extent required by ERISA.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided, each Benefit Component is a separate plan
for purposes of satisfying the nondiscrimination requirements of the Code.
However, each Benefit Component which is a self-insured group health plan (if
any), together with any HMO coverage that is offered in lieu of coverage under
any such Benefit Components, shall constitute a single plan for</P>
<hr>
<P>&nbsp;purposes of the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 105(h)(2) of
the Code. It is intended that all applicable nondiscrimination requirements of
the Code be satisfied, including all requirements under Code Sections 79,
105(h), and 125.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Welfare Plan is maintained for the exclusive benefit of Eligible Employees and/or any of their eligible Dependents.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general provisions of the Welfare Plan shall apply only to Eligible Employees of an Employer who are Participants as defined in Article I. Provisions of any individual Benefit Component shall apply only with respect to Participants who are eligible to receive Benefits under such Benefit Component. The rights and Benefits, if any, of former Employees who are Participants will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Welfare Plan as in effect on the date their employment terminated.</P>

any, will be paid to the Participant's estate or to any person or corporation
appearing to the Welfare Plan to be</P>

otherwise not competent to give a valid receipt for payment of any Benefit due
him under the Welfare Plan and if no request for payment has been received from
a duly appointed guardian or other legally appointed representative of that
person, payment may be made directly to the individual or institution that has

Written proof of loss must be furnished to the Plan Administrator or Claims Processor within two years after the date of the loss for which claim is made, provided that the Welfare Plan has not been terminated, or, if the Welfare Plan has been terminated, within 90 days of such termination. Failure to furnish written proof of loss within that time will neither invalidate nor reduce any claim if it is shown that it was not reasonably possible to furnish written proof of loss within that time, provided that such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, in the absence of legal incapacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual claiming Benefits must always comply with any applicable proof of loss or substantiation of claims provisions or requirements contained in any applicable Benefit Component.</P>

The Plan Administrator will be free from any liability that might arise in relation to such action. Any person claiming benefits under the Welfare Plan will furnish to the Plan Administrator such information as may be necessary to implement this provision.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="WCTOCLevel2Mark56in5g_01">5.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Subrogation</A></U>.
If any payment for benefits under the Welfare Plan are paid, the Welfare Plan

Each Participant or his legal guardian agrees to reimburse the Welfare Plan for
amounts paid for such claims, out of any monies recovered from the third party,
including but not limited to, any third parties and the Participant's own
insurance company as the result of judgment, settlement or otherwise. In

Except as otherwise provided, benefits under each Benefit Component shall be funded in the following manner:</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Trust Fund</U>. The Company may establish a trust fund into which contributions are made to pay benefits under one or more of the Benefit Components. If Benefits under a Benefit Component are funded through a trust fund, the Employers shall contribute to such trust fund the amount required to fund the Benefit payments and to accumulate such reserves as such Employer deems reasonable and necessary.</LI>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Self-Insured</U>. If Benefits under a Benefit Component are funded on a self-insured basis, the Employers shall pay Benefits under such Benefit Component from their general assets. However, an Employer, in its sole discretion, may establish a separate bank account for the payment of Benefits. If a separate bank account is established for such purpose, it shall be for bookkeeping purposes only. The Employers shall contribute any amounts necessary to provide any Benefits under a self-insured Benefit Component.</LI>
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Insured</U>. The Plan Administrator may purchase insurance either to provide benefits under a Benefit Component or, in the case of a Benefit Component funded by a trust fund or on a self-insured basis, to insure the Employers against certain excess claims or large aggregate losses. Any such insurance policy or policies shall contain terms that are consistent with the provisions of the Benefit Components and with the Benefits provided under such Benefit Component. Such policy or policies may contain any additional provisions as the Plan Administrator or Board may authorize.<p align="center">
