Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.17, 2.18 and 2.19 (subject to the requirements and limitations of such Sections, including the requirement to provide the forms and certificates pursuant to Section 2.19(e)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; <u>provided</u> that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.20(c) as though it were a Lender.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender, each Loan Party and the Administrative Agent shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.</font></p>

No Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.19 unless such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.19(e) as though it were a Lender.</font></p>
