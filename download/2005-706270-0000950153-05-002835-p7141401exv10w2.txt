described in this subsection in order to enable the Agent to record such
transaction.

giving effect to all repayments and prepayments of the Loan and each Loan
Discharge Exercise effected on or prior to such date.

its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing such Lender's portion of
the Loan outstanding from time to time, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

          (b) Agent's Records of Loan. The Agent shall establish and maintain a
register for recording with respect to the Loan (i) the date and amount of each
payment on the Loan made by or on behalf of, or collected from, the Borrower,
(ii) the amount of each such payment applied in accordance with Section 2.8(d)

          (c) Entries Prima Facie Evidence. The entries made in the accounts
maintained pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations recorded therein; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender
or the Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any
manner affect the obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loan in accordance
with its terms.

          (d) Notes. The Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Agent on the
Effective Date the following promissory notes:

          (i) a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 in the
     principal amount of Tranche A of the Loan outstanding on the date hereof,
     dated the Effective Date and otherwise appropriately completed (such note,
     including any replacement note therefor issued in accordance with the
     provisions of this Section 2.3(d), the "Tranche A Note");

          (ii) a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2 in the
     principal amount of Tranche B-1 of the Loan outstanding on the date hereof
     owing to the Tranche B-1 Lender, dated the Effective Date and otherwise
     appropriately completed, (each such note, including any replacement note
     therefor issued in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3(d), a
     "Tranche B-1 Note");

          (iii) a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B-3 in
     the principal amount of Tranche B-2 of the Loan outstanding on the date
     hereof owing to the Tranche B-2 Lender, dated the Effective Date and
     otherwise appropriately completed, (each such note, including any
     replacement note therefor issued in accordance with the provisions of this
     Section 2.3(d), a "Tranche B-2 Note");

          (iv) a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B-4 in the
     principal amount of Tranche B-3 of the Loan outstanding on the date hereof
     owing to the Tranche B-3 Lender, dated the Effective Date and otherwise
     appropriately completed, (each such note, including any replacement note
     therefor issued in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3(d), a
     "Tranche B-3 Note"); and

          (v) a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B-5 in the
     principal amount of Tranche B-4 of the Loan outstanding on the date hereof
     owing to the Tranche B-4 Lender, dated the Effective Date and otherwise

     therefor issued in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3(d), a
     "Tranche B-4 Note," and collectively with the Tranche A Note, Tranche B-1
     Note, Tranche B-2 Note and Tranche B-3 Note, the "Notes").

          Each Note shall be made payable to the Agent at the office of the
Agent; provided that at the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall execute
and deliver a Note (or replacement thereof) payable directly to such Lender in
the amount of its interest in the Loan. If a Note is mutilated, lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Borrower shall issue a new Note of the same Tranche in the same
principal amount and having the same interest rate, date and maturity as the
Note so mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed endorsed to indicate all payments
thereon. In the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed Note, there shall first be
furnished to the Borrower and the Board an instrument of indemnity from the
Agent (or Lender, as applicable) and evidence of such loss, theft or destruction
reasonably satisfactory to each of them. Upon the execution and delivery by the
Borrower of the Notes, the promissory notes executed and delivered by the
Borrower under the Original Loan Agreement shall be null and void and of no
further force and effect, and shall be contemporaneously returned to the
Borrower for cancellation.

          (e) Register. A manually signed copy of this Agreement and the
original of a Note shall be evidence of (i) the rights of each Lender under this
Agreement and such Note and (ii) the rights of the Agent under this Agreement.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the Notes is a bearer instrument. The Agent
will establish and maintain a record of ownership (the "Register") in which the
Agent agrees to register by book entry the Agent's and each Lender's interest in
the Loan, the Notes and this Agreement, and in the right to receive any payments
hereunder or thereunder (including any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.2(b))
and any assignment of any such interest or rights. In connection with any
assignment pursuant to Section 9.2, the Agent shall maintain a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and shall record the
names and addresses of the Lenders and principal amount of the Loan owing to
each Lender from time to time. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.3(e), the
Agent shall be the Borrower's agent for purposes of establishing and maintaining
the Register. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Board, the Agent and
the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower, the Agent, the Board (so long as the Board is either
a guarantor of Tranche A or a Lender hereunder), the Loan Administrator or any
Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

          SECTION 2.4. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS.

          (a) Notice. Subject to subsection (e) below, the Borrower may, upon at
least fifteen (15) days' prior revocable notice to the Board, the
Counter-Guarantors, the Loan Administrator and the Agent stating the proposed
date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, elect to prepay the
outstanding principal amount of the Loan ratably as to Tranche A and Tranche B,
in whole or in part (but not less than a minimum amount of $2,500,000), together
with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount
prepaid; provided, however, that upon any prepayment of all or a portion of the
Loan by the Borrower, or if the Borrower revokes such notice at any time within
such fifteen (15) days, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant
to Section 2.9(e); provided, further, that if the Borrower prepays all or a
portion of the Loan, the Borrower shall also pay any Prepayment Premium owing
pursuant to subsection (d) below.

          (b) Amounts Due upon Notice. Upon the giving of any notice of
prepayment under Section 2.4(a), the principal amount of the Loan specified to
be prepaid together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and any Prepayment
Premium payable pursuant to subsection (d) below, shall (subject to the first
proviso below) become due and payable on the date specified for such prepayment;
provided, however, that any failure to make any such prepayment in full on such
date shall be deemed to be an automatic revocation of the notice of prepayment
given under Section 2.4(a) and such failure shall not constitute a Default or an
Event of Default hereunder; provided, further, however, that the Borrower shall
be obligated to pay on such date any amounts owing under Section 2.9(e) due to
such failure to prepay.

          (c) Application of Optional Prepayments. Any partial prepayment of the
Loan under this Section 2.4 (other than (i) a prepayment of Tranche B-2 as
provided under subsection (e) below and (ii) any Prepayment Premium payable
under subsection (d) below) shall be applied to the outstanding principal amount
of the Loan ratably as to each Lender and, with respect to each Lender, pro rata
across the remaining scheduled principal payments on the Loan owing to each such
Lender (and not in the inverse order of maturity). Any such prepayment shall be
paid to the Agent for application as provided in Section 2.8, other than any
Prepayment Premium which shall be paid by the Agent on a pro rata basis to the
holders of the portions of the Loan which respect to which such Prepayment
Premium was payable as provided in subsection (d) below. The Borrower shall have
no right to optionally prepay the principal amount of the Loan other than as
provided in this Section 2.4, Section 2.9(b) or Section 2.9(d).


                                       36

<PAGE>

          (d) Prepayment Premium. In addition to amounts which the Borrower is
required to pay in connection with an optional prepayment of the Loan as
provided above, the Borrower shall also pay on the date of such prepayment a
premium (the "Prepayment Premium") on the prepaid portion of the Loan calculated
in the manner set forth below; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be
required to pay a Prepayment Premium with respect to the amount of the
prepayment attributable to (i) such portion of the Loan which is then held by
the Initial Lender, (ii) such portion of Tranche A which is then held by the
Board in connection with a payment by the Board under the Board Guaranty, (iii)
such portion of Tranche B-1, Tranche B-2 or Tranche B-3 which is then held by
the applicable Counter-Guarantor in connection with a payment by such
Counter-Guarantor under its Counter-Guarantee, (iv) such portion of Tranche A,
Tranche B-1, Tranche B-2 or Tranche B-3 then held by a permitted assignee of the
Initial Lender (or a permitted assignee thereof) if and to the extent that such
assigned portion of the Loan continues to be guaranteed under the Board Guaranty
or the applicable Counter-Guarantee, as the case may be, following such
assignment, or (v) a prepayment, in whole or in part, of Tranche B-2 pursuant to
subsection (e) below. The Prepayment Premium on the portion of the Loan with
respect to which it is payable shall be calculated as follows:

<TABLE>

Thereafter                                      None
</TABLE>

          (e) Prepayment of Tranche B-2. Anything to the contrary contained
herein notwithstanding, the Borrower may elect to prepay the outstanding
principal amount of Tranche B-2 of the Loan, in whole or in part, together with
accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid
and any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.9(e) (but without any prepayment
premium under subsection (d) above). For the avoidance of doubt, any such
prepayment shall be applied to prepay the outstanding principal amount of
Tranche B-2 only, shall not be applied to prepay the outstanding principal
amount of any other Tranches of the Loan, and shall be paid directly to the
Tranche B-2 Lender notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein.
Any prepayment of Tranche B-2 under this subsection (e) shall be applied to the
outstanding principal amount of Tranche B-2 pro rata across the remaining
scheduled principal payments on Tranche B-2.

          SECTION 2.5. MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

          (a) Certain Future Issuances within Six Months of Effective Date.
Subject to subsection (i) below, upon receipt by an Obligor of any Cash Proceeds
from any Future Issuance of Indebtedness convertible into Capital Stock (or
convertible into warrants, options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock)
which is consummated no later than six (6) months after the Effective Date, the
Borrower shall prepay the Loan in the manner provided below in an amount equal
to the product of (x) the Loan Prepayment Percentage and (y) an amount equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the Net Issue Proceeds of such Future Issuance; provided

Financing, the Borrower shall prepay the Loan from the proceeds thereof in the
manner provided below in an aggregate amount equal to the Collateral Release
Value for each item or category (as applicable) of Collateral subject to such
Replacement Secured Financing; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be
obligated to so prepay the Loan if and to the extent that such Cash Proceeds are
required to be utilized to prepay the US Airways


                                       37

<PAGE>

Loan pursuant to the US Airways Loan Agreement. Any prepayment of the Loan under
this subsection shall be made on the Business Day following the receipt by such
Obligor of the proceeds of the applicable Future Issuance.

          (c) Other Future Issuances. Subject to subsection (i) below, upon

a Future Issuance described in (or excluded from prepayment pursuant to)
subsections (a) and (b) above, the Borrower shall prepay the Loan in the manner
provided below in an amount equal to the product of (x) the Loan Prepayment
Percentage and (y) 100% of the Net Issue Proceeds of such transaction; provided
that:

          (i) with respect to Future Issuances of Capital Stock or warrants,
     options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock consummated after the
     Effective Date (excluding Indebtedness which is convertible into Capital
     Stock), the Borrower (A) shall not be obligated to prepay the Loan from the
     first $75,000,000 of Net Issue Proceeds therefrom, and (B) thereafter,
     shall be obligated to prepay the Loan in an amount equal to the product of
     (x) the Loan Prepayment Percentage and (y)(1) 25% on a dollar-for-dollar
     basis of Net Issue Proceeds from the next $75,000,000 of Net Issue Proceeds
     and (2) 50% on a dollar-for-dollar basis of Net Issue Proceeds in excess of
     $150,000,000, with all calculations of Net Issue Proceeds for the purpose
     of this clause (i) being made on a cumulative basis from the Effective Date
     through the life of the Loan;

          (ii) with respect to Net Issue Proceeds from a Future Issuance of
     Indebtedness incurred to refinance any Aircraft Related Equipment that is
     not (and is not required to be pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents)
     Collateral, the Borrower shall only be required to pay an amount equal to
     the product of (x) the Loan Prepayment Percentage and (y) an amount equal
     to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Issue Proceeds from such Future Issuance;
     provided that the Obligors shall not be required to prepay the Loan as
     provided in this clause (ii) if such Future Issuance is a refinancing of
     Aircraft Related Equipment acquired by the Obligors within the twenty-four
     (24) months preceding the date of such Future Issuance; and

          (iii) the Borrower shall not be obligated to so prepay the Loan (A) if
     and to the extent that the Future Issuance is (x) Permitted Refinancing
     Indebtedness or (y) Permitted Acquisition Financing, (B) if and to the
     extent that an Obligor applies the proceeds of a Future Issuance of
     Indebtedness to make pre-delivery payments, deposits or progress payments
     (or other similar payments) with respect to the acquisition of Aircraft
     Related Equipment (or reimburses itself or any other Obligor for any such
     payment or deposit) (including After-Acquired Section 1110 Equipment), an
     Obligor applies such proceeds to purchase (or reimburse itself or any other
     Obligor for the purchase of) Aircraft Related Equipment (including
     After-Acquired Section 1110 Equipment), or an Obligor otherwise sets aside
     such proceeds (through an escrow account or otherwise) for a period not to
     exceed twelve (12) months for the express purpose of making any of the
     payments described above in this subclause (iii)(B) and the Obligor makes
     such payment within such period, or (C) with the Net Issue Proceeds of (x)
     the Juniper Financing or (y) the Airbus Financing, it being understood
     that, subject to subsection (c)(ii) above, the Loan Prepayment Percentage
     of all Net Issue Proceeds in excess of amounts otherwise applied in

     applied to prepay the Loan.

Any prepayment of the Loan under this subsection (c) shall be made on the

     Collateral or (B) After-Acquired Section 1110 Equipment which has been
     pledged as Collateral but is subject to release pursuant to Section 5.8(b),
     the Borrower shall prepay the Loan in an amount equal to the product of (x)
     the Loan Prepayment Percentage and (y) an amount equal to fifty percent
     (50%) of the Net Cash Proceeds of such sale-leaseback; provided that the
     Obligors shall not be required to prepay the Loan with the Net Cash

     Certificate certifying that it or another Obligor intends to replace the
     assets from which such Net Cash Proceeds derived, and does so (or enters
     into a definitive agreement committing to do so) within one (1) year of
     receipt thereof (it being understood that any Net Cash Proceeds retained by
     the Borrower but not actually expended within such year or pursuant to such
     agreement to replace the assets from which such Net Cash Proceeds derived
     shall be used to prepay the Loan on the expiration of such year), (B) with
     Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds do
     not exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate per Fiscal Year, or (C) from the

no later than three (3) Business Days following (x) the date of receipt by an
Obligor of any Net Insurance Proceeds or Net Condemnation Proceeds, or (y) if

in the case of the Collateral, such other time as provided in the applicable
Collateral Document (as contemplated in the proviso below), the Borrower shall
prepay the Loan in an amount equal to the amount by which the aggregate amount
of the sum of such Net Insurance Proceeds and Net Condemnation Proceeds in any
Fiscal Year (excluding any amounts used to repair, restore or replace assets in
accordance with the immediately following proviso or any Collateral Document)
exceeds $5,000,000; provided the Borrower shall not be obligated to so prepay
the Loan if and to the extent that (i) the Borrower furnishes to the Board and
the Agent on or prior to the date such prepayment is otherwise required to be
made an Officer's Certificate certifying that it or another Obligor intends to
repair, restore or replace the assets from which such Net Insurance Proceeds or
Net Condemnation Proceeds derived, and does so (or enters into a definitive
agreement committing to do so) within one (1) year of receipt thereof, (ii) in
the case of proceeds derived from Collateral, the Obligor uses such proceeds to
repair, replace or restore such Collateral in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the applicable Collateral Document, including any time frames
contemplated thereby (it being understood that any Net Insurance


                                       39

<PAGE>

Proceeds or Net Condemnation Proceeds retained by an Obligor but not actually
expended within such year or such other time as provided in an applicable
Collateral Document or pursuant to such agreement to repair, restore or replace
the assets from which such Net Insurance Proceeds or Net Condemnation Proceeds
derived shall be used to prepay the Loan on the expiration of such year or such
other time as provided in an applicable Collateral Document), or (iii) such Cash
Proceeds are required to be utilized to prepay the US Airways Loan pursuant to
the US Airways Loan Agreement.

          (f) Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the
Borrower shall promptly give the Agent, the Lenders, the Board, each
Counter-Guarantor and the Loan Administrator written notice thereof, and the
Controlling Creditor shall have the right, by written notice to the Borrower
(with a copy to the Agent and each Lender) given not more than thirty (30) days
following its or their receipt of the notice of the Change of Control, to
require the Borrower to prepay the Loan in full, together with accrued interest
thereon to the date of such prepayment, on the date specified in such notice
(which date shall be a Business Day not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty
(20) Business Days after the date of such notice), and upon the specified
payment date, the Borrower shall so prepay the then outstanding principal amount
of the Loan together with such accrued interest thereon.

          (g) Gate Leases. In the event that the Obligors shall not have pledged
to the Collateral Agent the Gate Leases at both LGA and DCA (with the consent of
the lessors thereof) by January 1 of any year, the Borrower shall prepay the
Loan on such date in the amount of $10,000,000; provided that the Borrower shall
not be obligated to so prepay the Loan if and to the extent that US Airways is
required to prepay the US Airways Loan on such date pursuant to Section 2.8(g)
of the US Airways Loan Agreement.

          (h) Collateral Value Deficiency. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Collateral Value Deficiency under Section 5.8(d), the Borrower
shall prepay the Loan if and to the extent required thereunder; provided,
however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to so prepay the Loan if and
to the extent that the Borrower or another Obligor is required to prepay the US
Airways Loan pursuant to Section 5.8(d) of the US Airways Loan Agreement to cure
a Collateral Value Deficiency thereunder (and as defined therein).

          (i) Option of Lenders to Decline Mandatory Prepayments. At least five
(5) Business Days prior to any date (for purposes of this subsection, a
"Mandatory Prepayment Date") on which any mandatory prepayment of the Loan
would, but for the provisions of this subsection (i), otherwise be required to
be made pursuant to subsections (a), (c), (d) or (e) of this Section 2.5, the
Borrower shall deliver a loan prepayment notice to the Agent and the Board
setting forth the amount of such mandatory prepayment (or a good faith estimate
thereof if such amount is not then known), and the date upon which the Borrower
expects to make such prepayment; provided, that the Borrower's obligation to
make such prepayment shall, in the case of a prepayment under subsections (a),
(c) or (d) of this Section 2.5, be subject to the consummation of the
transaction giving rise to such prepayment and the Borrower's timely receipt of
the Net Issue Proceeds or Net Cash Proceeds (as the case may be) therefrom. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Agent shall (i) promptly notify each Lender, the
Board and each Counter-Guarantor of the contents thereof and of the prepayment
that each Lender will be entitled to receive if it accepts prepayment of its
portion of the Loan in accordance with this subsection, (ii) request that each
such Lender notify the Agent in writing, no later than the third (3rd) Business
Day prior to the Mandatory Prepayment Date, whether such Lender will elect to
accept or not accept its pro rata share of such prepayment and (iii) inform such
Lender that the failure by such Lender to give such notice shall be deemed an
acceptance of such prepayment. No later than two (2) Business Day prior to the
Mandatory Prepayment Date, the Agent shall notify the Borrower of the Lenders'
elections and the aggregate amount of the prepayment required to be made as a
result thereof. The Borrower shall thereafter prepay the Loan on such Mandatory
Prepayment Date in the amount of such prepayment (after giving effect to the


                                       40

<PAGE>

Lenders' elections), which the Agent shall apply as a prepayment of such
portions of the Loan held by each of the Lenders that shall have accepted (or
been deemed to have accepted) such prepayment. The foregoing notwithstanding, if
and to the extent that Tranche A, Tranche B-1, Tranche B-2 or Tranche B-3 is
then guaranteed under the Board Guaranty or a Counter-Guarantee (as applicable),
none of the Tranche A Lender, Tranche B-1 Lender, Tranche B-2 Lender or Tranche
B-3 Lender shall elect to decline its pro rata amount of any such prepayment of
the Loan without the consent of the Board (in the case of such portion of
Tranche A then guaranteed under the Board Guaranty) or the applicable
Counter-Guarantor (in the case of such portion of Tranche B-1, Tranche B-2 or
Tranche B-3 then guaranteed under such Counter-Guarantor's Counter-Guarantee).

          (j) Application of Prepayments. Any partial prepayments of the Loan
made by the Borrower in accordance with this Section 2.5 shall be applied to the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan ratably as to each Lender and, with
respect to each Lender, pro rata across the remaining scheduled principal
payments on the Loan owing to each such Lender (and not in the inverse order of
maturity). Subject to the Borrower's right to elect the Prepayment Breakage
Avoidance Procedure, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to
Section 2.9(e) in connection with any prepayment under this Section 2.5. All
prepayments under this Section 2.5 shall be paid to the Agent for application as
provided in Section 2.8.

          SECTION 2.6. INTEREST.

          (a) Rate of Interest. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6(c)
and Section 2.9, the Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount
thereof from the first day of the initial Interest Period hereunder until paid
in full at the Applicable Interest Rate; provided, that interest on Tranche A
and Tranche B of the Loan from the first day of the initial Interest Period
hereunder until the Effective Date shall accrue at the Applicable Interest Rate
(including the default rates, as applicable), provided for in the Original Loan
Agreement.

          (b) Interest Payments. Interest accrued on the Loan shall be payable
in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, upon the payment or prepayment thereof
in whole or in part, and, if not previously paid in full, at maturity (whether
by acceleration or otherwise). Interest on the Loan shall be calculated on the
basis of a year of 360 days and actual number of days elapsed.

          (c) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the rate of interest specified
in Section 2.6(a), if any principal of or interest on the Loan is not paid when
due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or
otherwise (but other than any voluntary prepayment), such overdue amount shall
bear interest at a rate which is two percent (2.0%) per annum in excess of the
then applicable interest rate(s) on the Loan (or portions thereof).

          (d) Assignment of Loan During an Interest Period. If some or all of
the Loan is assigned in compliance with Section 9.2 on a date which is not the
first day of an Interest Period and the Applicable Interest Rate on the portion
so assigned will be adjusted as a result thereof (as provided in the definition
of "Applicable Interest Rate"), then interest on the portion of the Loan so
assigned shall accrue at the adjusted Applicable Interest Rate from and
including the effective date of such assignment until paid in full.

          SECTION 2.7. FEES.

          (a) Agency Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent on the

that, such Counter-Guarantor's Counter-Guarantee shall remain in effect;

which relates to the period between the Interest Payment Date falling on or
about December 31, 2005 and the anniversary of the Closing Date.

          (f) Collateral Agent Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for

$42,500 per annum for so long as the Loan shall remain outstanding.

          (g) Lazard Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to Lazard Freres & Co. on
the Effective Date a fee in the amount of $1,000,000 for advisory services
provided to the Board in connection with the Merger and the restructuring of the
Loan.

          (h) Liquidity Fee. The Borrower agrees that if (i) at any time after
the Closing Date the Regulations are amended, modified or supplemented such that
the Board's consent shall be necessary in order for a Lender to sell a
participation in the Loan to any Person the sale of a participation to which
would not require the Board's consent if the Regulations were then as in effect
on the Closing Date and (ii) the Initial Lender seeks the Board's consent to
sell such a participation and such consent is not granted, then the Initial
Lender shall so notify the Borrower and the Agent and the Borrower shall
thereafter pay to the Agent for the account of the Initial Lender a liquidity
fee equal to 0.10% per annum of the principal amount of Tranche A of the Loan
then guaranteed under the Board Guaranty, such liquidity fee to accrue from the
date of such notice from the Initial Lender and to be payable on each Interest
Payment Date.

          (i) Distribution of Fees. On the Effective Date and upon the Agent's
receipt thereof, the Agent shall distribute to the Person entitled thereto each

payable under this Section 2.7 in accordance with Section 2.8(d) or (e) hereof,
as applicable.

          (j) Fees Non-refundable. All fees paid under this Section 2.7 shall be
non-refundable.

          (k) Interest on Fees. If any fee or other amount payable by the

at a rate which is two percent (2.0%) per annum in excess of the Applicable
Interest Rate as in effect from time to time.

          SECTION 2.8. PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.

          (a) Payments. The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder
(including fees and expenses) not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on

error.

          (c) Payments on Business Days. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case
may be.

          (d) Application of Payments - No Event of Default. So long as no Event
of Default under any of clauses (a) (including any failure to pay all amounts
hereunder upon acceleration as a result of any other Event of Default), (f) or
(g) of Section 7.1 has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, the
Agent shall apply all payments in respect of any Obligations (except with
respect to payments made pursuant to Section 2.4(d) and (e)) in the following
order:

          (i) first, to pay any fees then due and payable under Section 2.7(a),
     (b) and (f) to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Loan Administrator,
     as the case may be, on a pro rata basis;

          (ii) second, to pay interest then due and payable in respect of the
     Loan to the Lenders on a pro rata basis, provided that, so long as the
     Board Guaranty is in effect, to the extent that any amounts received by the
     Agent constitute interest accrued on any overdue principal of or interest
     on Tranche A in accordance with Section 2.6(c), such amounts shall be
     distributed to the Board under this clause (ii) as if it were a Lender (it
     being understood that following the Board's honoring of a demand for
     payment in accordance with the Board Guaranty and until the Board is
     reimbursed for the amount of all payments thereunder, all amounts paid in
     respect of Tranche A shall be distributed to the Board and amounts paid in
     respect of Tranche B shall be distributed to the Tranche B Lenders, all on
     a pro rata basis);


                                       43

<PAGE>

          (iii) third, to pay principal then due and payable on the Loan to the
     Lenders, on a pro rata basis (it being understood that following the
     Board's honoring of a demand for payment in accordance with the Board
     Guaranty and until the Board is reimbursed for the amount of all payments
     thereunder, the amounts paid in respect of Tranche A shall be distributed
     to the Board and amounts paid in respect of Tranche B shall be distributed
     to the Tranche B Lenders, in each case on a pro rata basis);

          (iv) fourth, to pay any fees then due and payable under Section
     2.7(c), (d), (e) and (h) to the Board, the Counter-Guarantors and the
     Initial Lender, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis; and

          (v) fifth, to pay any other Obligations then due and payable to the
     Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Loan Administrator, the Board, the
     Counter-Guarantors and the Lenders, on a pro rata basis.

          (e) Application of Payments After Event of Default. After the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under any of
clauses (a) (including any failure to pay all amounts hereunder upon
acceleration as a result of any other Event of Default), (f) or (g) of Section
7.1, the Agent shall apply all payments in respect of any Obligations (including
amounts received by the Collateral Agent upon the exercise of remedies under the
Collateral Documents) in the following order:

          (i) first, to pay Obligations in respect of any expenses, fees,
     indemnities or other sums owing hereunder then due to the Agent, the
     Collateral Agent and the Loan Administrator, on a pro rata basis;

          (ii) second, to pay Obligations in respect of any expenses, fees,
     indemnities or other sums owing hereunder not referred to in clauses (iii)
     through (v) below then due to the Board, the Lenders and the
     Counter-Guarantors, on a pro rata basis;

          (iii) third, to pay on a pro rata basis (A) interest then due and
     payable in respect of the Loan to the Lenders, provided that so long as the
     Board Guaranty is in effect, to the extent that any amounts received by the
     Agent constitute interest accrued on any overdue principal or interest on
     Tranche A in accordance with Section 2.6(c), such amounts shall be
     distributed to the Board under this clause (iii) as if it were a Lender and
     (B) in the event that any fees payable to the Board, the Counter-Guarantors
     and the Initial Lender, under Section 2.7(c), (d), (e) and (h) were not
     paid when due thereunder, the portion of such unpaid fees which is equal to
     the amount which such Person would have been then entitled to receive if
     the fee payable under Section 2.7(c), (d), (e) and (h) (as applicable) were
     payable daily in arrears (instead of quarterly or annually in advance, as
     the case may be) (including interest accrued thereon through the date of
     payment in accordance with Section 2.7(k), on a pro rata basis (it being
     understood that following the Board's honoring of a demand for payment in
     accordance with the Board Guaranty and until the Board is reimbursed for
     the amount of all payments thereunder, all amounts paid in respect of
     Tranche A shall be distributed to the Board and amounts paid in respect of
     Tranche B shall be distributed to the Tranche B Lenders, all on a pro rata
     basis);

          (iv) fourth, to pay or prepay principal payments on the Loan to the
     Lenders, on a pro rata basis (it being understood that following the
     Board's honoring of a demand for payment in accordance with the Board
     Guaranty and until the Board is reimbursed for the amount of all payments
     thereunder, amounts paid in respect of Tranche A shall be distributed to
     the Board and amounts paid in respect of Tranche B shall be distributed to
     the Tranche B Lenders, in each case on a pro rata basis); and


                                       44

<PAGE>

          (v) fifth, to pay any fees due and payable under Section 2.7(c), (d),
     (e) and (h) hereof to the Board, the Counter-Guarantors and the Initial
     Lender, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis (including interest accrued
     thereon through the date of payment in accordance with Section 2.7(k) and
     not otherwise paid pursuant to clause (iii) above.

          (f) Assignment to Board of Lender's Interest in Loan. Upon the
assignment to the Board of any Tranche A Lender's right, title and interest in
and to its pro rata portion of the principal of and interest on Tranche A in
accordance with the Board Guaranty, the Board shall have the rights and
privileges of a Tranche A Lender with respect to such payment (to the extent of
the interests in Tranche A so assigned to the Board). No payment by the Board or
any Counter-Guarantor to the Agent or any Lender under the Board Guaranty or any
Counter-Guarantee, as the case may be, shall reduce, discharge, satisfy, modify
or terminate the corresponding payment or any other obligation of the Borrower
under this Agreement or the Notes, which obligations shall remain in full force
and effect.

          (g) Funding Defaults. Unless the Borrower has notified the Agent,
prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Agent
hereunder, that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume
that the Borrower has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so
required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the
Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact
made to the Agent in immediately available funds, then each Lender (or the
Board, if applicable) shall forthwith on demand repay to the Agent the portion
of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender (or the Board, if
applicable) in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in
respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available
by the Agent to such Lender (or the Board, if applicable) to the date such
amount is repaid to the Agent in immediately available funds, at the applicable
Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the definition of "Base Rate Loan") from time
to time in effect. A notice of the Agent to the Borrower with respect to any
amount owing under this subsection (g) shall be conclusive, absent manifest
error.

          SECTION 2.9. CERTAIN PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE LOAN.

          (a) Determination of Interest Rate. LIBOR for each Interest Period for
the Loan shall be determined by the Agent pursuant to the procedures set forth
in the definition of "LIBOR", and shall promptly thereafter be notified to the
Borrower and each Lender together with the Applicable Interest Rate for such
Interest Period.

          (b) Interest Rate Unascertainable, Inadequate or Unfair. In the event
that: (i) the Agent determines that adequate and fair means do not exist for
ascertaining the applicable interest rates by reference to which the LIBOR then
being determined is to be fixed or (ii) the Requisite Lenders notify the Agent
that the LIBOR for any Interest Period will not adequately reflect the cost to
the relevant Lenders of making or maintaining the Loan for such Interest Period,
the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower, the Board, the Loan
Administrator and the Lenders, whereupon during the thirty (30) days following
the date of any such notice the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall
negotiate in good faith (subject to the consent of the Board) in order to arrive
at a mutually acceptable alternative basis for determining the interest rate
from time to time applicable to the Loan (the "Substitute Basis"). If within the
twenty (20) days following the date of any such notice the Borrower, the Agent
and the Lenders shall agree upon, and the Board shall consent to, a Substitute
Basis, such Substitute Basis shall be retroactive to and effective from the
first day of the then current Interest Period until and including the last day
of such Interest Period. If after twenty (20) days from the date of such notice,
the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall have failed to agree upon, or the
Board shall have failed to consent to, a Substitute Basis, then the Agent (upon
instructions from the Requisite Lenders) shall certify in writing to the
Borrower (such certification to be conclusive and binding on all Lenders and all
other parties hereto absent manifest


                                       45

<PAGE>

error) the interest rate at which such Lenders are prepared to maintain their
portion of the Loan for such Interest Period, it being understood that such
Lenders' interest rate shall be at a rate per annum equal to a rate which
adequately and fairly reflects the cost to such Lenders of obtaining the funds
necessary to maintain their portion of the Loan for such Interest Period. If no
Substitute Basis is established, upon receipt of notice of the interest rates at
which the Requisite Lenders are prepared to maintain their respective portion of
the Loan, the Borrower shall have the right exercisable upon ten (10) Business
Days' prior notice to the Lenders, the Board and the Loan Administrator through
the Agent (i) to continue to borrow the Loan at the interest rate so advised by
the Agent (as such rate may be modified, from time to time, at the outset of
each subsequent Interest Period), (ii) to convert the Loan to a Base Rate Loan,
or (iii) to prepay in full the Loan together with accrued but unpaid interest
thereon at the interest rate certified in writing by the Requisite Lenders as
provided above and all other amounts due under the Loan Documents, whereupon the
Loan shall become due and payable on the date specified by the Borrower in such
notice.

          (c) Increased Costs. If at any time any Lender or Counter-Guarantor
shall determine that as a result of the introduction of or any change after the
date hereof in or in the interpretation of any law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation or order or the compliance by such Lender or Counter-Guarantor with
any guideline, request or directive after the date hereof from any central bank
or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there
shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender or Counter-Guarantor of
agreeing to make or making, funding, guaranteeing or maintaining any portion of
the Loan or its Counter-Guarantee (except in respect of Taxes), then the
Borrower shall from time to time, within five (5) Business Days of a demand
(which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for
such demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail) by
such Lender or Counter-Guarantor (with a copy of such demand to the Agent, the
Board and the Loan Administrator), pay to the Agent for the account of such
Lender or Counter-Guarantor additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender or Counter-Guarantor for such increased cost; provided that no Lender or
Counter-Guarantor shall be entitled to claim any such additional amount for
amounts incurred more than six (6) months prior to the making of such demand. A
certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower
(and the Agent and the Board) by such Lender or Counter-Guarantor shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. Each Lender or
Counter-Guarantor shall promptly notify in writing the Borrower, the Agent and
the Board of any event of which such Lender or Counter-Guarantor has knowledge,
occurring after the date hereof, which would entitle such Lender or
Counter-Guarantor to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.9(c) and will
designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of
such Lender or Counter-Guarantor, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to it.

          (d) Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
if any Lender determines that the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order
after the date of this Agreement shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or
other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for such Lender
to maintain its portion of the Loan, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to
the Borrower through the Agent (with a copy to the Board and the Loan
Administrator), the obligation of such Lender to continue to fund or maintain
its portion of the Loan shall be terminated and the Borrower shall either (i)
convert the affected portion of the Loan of such Lender to a Base Rate Loan,
either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may
lawfully continue to maintain its portion of the Loan based on LIBOR to such
day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such
portion of the Loan based on LIBOR or (ii) prepay such affected portion of the
Loan to such Lender together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon and all
other sums payable hereunder with respect thereto on the last day of the then
current Interest Period or earlier if necessary to avoid such illegality. Any
such partial prepayment


                                       46

<PAGE>

of the Loan shall be applied ratably to the then unpaid installments thereof in
accordance with the amount of each such unpaid installment.

          (e) Breakage Costs. In addition to all amounts required to be paid by
the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.5, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender
or each Counter-Guarantor upon demand, for all losses, expenses and liabilities
(including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender or
Counter-Guarantor or the termination of any other financial arrangement it may
have entered into to fund or maintain or support such Lender's portion of the
Loan or its Counter-Guarantee, but excluding Taxes) which that Lender or
Counter-Guarantor may sustain (i) subject to the Borrower's right to utilize the
Prepayment Breakage Avoidance Procedure, if for any reason any portion of the
Loan is prepaid (including mandatorily pursuant to Section 2.5 or this Section
2.9) or a payment is made with respect to a Counter-Guarantee on a date which is
not the last day of the applicable Interest Period or (ii) as a consequence of
any failure by a Borrower to repay any portion of the Loan or make payment with
respect to a Counter-Guarantee when required by the terms hereof. The Lender or
Counter-Guarantor making demand for such compensation shall deliver to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Agent, the Board and the Loan Administrator)
concurrently with such demand a written statement as to such losses, expenses
and liabilities, and this statement shall be conclusive as to the amount of
compensation due to that Lender or Counter-Guarantor absent manifest error, and
such compensation shall be paid to the Agent for the account of such Lender.

          SECTION 2.10. CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If at any time any Lender or
Counter-Guarantor determines that (a) the adoption of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order
after the date of this Agreement regarding capital adequacy, (b) compliance with
any such law, treaty, rule, regulation, or order or (c) compliance with any
guideline or request or directive from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority or any accounting board or authority (whether or not a Governmental
Authority) which is responsible for the establishment or interpretation of
national or international accounting principles (in each case, whether or not
having the force of law) shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
such Lender's or Counter-Guarantor's (or any corporation controlling such
Lender's or Counter-Guarantor's) capital as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder (other than with respect to Taxes) to a level below that which such
Lender, Counter-Guarantor or corporation could have achieved but for such
adoption, change, compliance or interpretation, then, upon demand from time to
time by such Lender or Counter-Guarantor (with a copy of such demand to the
Agent and the Board), the Borrower shall within five (5) Business Days of such
demand pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender or Counter-Guarantor from
time to time as specified by such Lender or Counter-Guarantor additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender or Counter-Guarantor for such reduction;
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or
Counter-Guarantor pursuant to this Section 2.10 for any amounts incurred more
than six (6) months prior to the date of such demand. A certificate as to such
amounts submitted to the Borrower (and the Agent and the Board) by such Lender
or Counter-Guarantor shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent
manifest error. Each Lender or Counter-Guarantor shall promptly notify the
Borrower, the Agent and the Board of any event of which such Lender or
Counter-Guarantor has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which would
entitle such Lender or Counter-Guarantor to compensation pursuant to this
Section 2.10 and, in the case of a Lender, will designate a different lending
office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to it. For the avoidance of doubt, any interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 by FASB (including Interpretation No. 46 -
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities) shall constitute an adoption,
change, request or directive, and any implementation thereof shall be, subject
to this Section 2.10.

          SECTION 2.11. TAXES.

          (a) No Withholding, etc. Except as otherwise provided in the next
sentence and Section 9.2, any and all payments by the Obligors under each Loan
Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all
Taxes, excluding (i) in the case of each Lender, the Loan Administrator, each
Counter-Guarantor, each Participant and the Agent, Taxes measured by its net
income and franchise Taxes, in each case if imposed on it as a result of such
Person being organized under the laws of the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes or
doing business in such jurisdiction unrelated to the transactions contemplated
by the Original Loan Agreement or any Loan Document, (ii) in the case of each
Lender and each Participant, Taxes measured by its net income and franchise
Taxes imposed on it by the jurisdiction in which its Lending Office is located
or in which it booked its participation for tax accounting purposes, (iii) in
the case of each Counter-Guarantor, net income and franchise taxes imposed by
the jurisdiction to which the Borrower is directed to make payments to the
Counter-Guarantor pursuant to the Loan Documents, (iv) in the case of each
Lender, the Loan Administrator, each Counter-Guarantor, each Participant and the
Agent, Taxes imposed on it as a result of its failure to comply with its
obligations under Section 2.11(g), Section 2.11(h) or Section 9.2, (v) in the
case of each Lender, the Loan Administrator, each Participant, each
Counter-Guarantor and the Agent (A) that is a party hereto or Participant, as
the case may be, on the Effective Date, United States federal withholding Taxes
except to the extent imposed as a result of a change in applicable law,
including income tax conventions, after the Effective Date and (B) that becomes
a party hereto or Participant, as the case may be, after the Effective Date,
United States federal withholding Taxes except to the extent imposed as a result
of a change in applicable law, including income tax conventions, after the date
of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender or after
the date such Person becomes a Participant, the Loan Administrator or the Agent,
as applicable, and (vi) Taxes imposed as a result of such Person's gross
negligence or willful misconduct (all such non-excluded Taxes being hereinafter
referred to as "Indemnified Taxes"). If any Indemnified Taxes shall be required
by law to be deducted from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan
Document to any Lender, the Loan Administrator, any Counter-Guarantor or the
Agent (1) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 2.11) such Lender, the Loan Administrator, such
Counter-Guarantor or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (2) the
Obligors shall make such deductions, and (3) the Obligors shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law.

          (b) Counter-Guarantee Taxes. If any Taxes (other than Taxes imposed as
a result of the failure of the Counter-Guarantor to comply with its obligations
under Section 2.11(g)) shall be required by law to be deducted from or in
respect of any sum payable under any Counter-Guarantee to any Counter-Guarantor
("Counter-Guarantee Taxes"), (i) the Agent shall make such deductions and shall
so notify the Borrower (such notice shall be accompanied by a statement setting
forth the basis for such deductions and a calculation of the amount thereof in
reasonable detail), (ii) the Agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law,
and (iii) the Borrower shall pay to such Counter-Guarantor such amounts as may
be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.11) such
Counter-Guarantor receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
no such deductions been made. Further, if any Taxes are required by law to be
deducted from or in respect of any sum payable under any Counter-Guarantee by
any Counter-Guarantor to the Agent, any Lender or any Participant and such
Counter-Guarantor in accordance with the terms of its Counter-Guarantee pays
such amounts as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
the Agent, such Lender or such Participant, as the case may be, receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction been made,
the Borrower shall pay the amount thereof to the Agent for the account of


                                       48

<PAGE>

such Counter-Guarantor (together with any additional amounts such that the
Counter-Guarantor receives, after deduction for all Taxes required to be
withheld, the amount so paid by the Counter-Guarantor).

          (c) Other Taxes. In addition, the Obligors agree to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar levies of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or
any applicable foreign jurisdiction which arise from any payment made under any
Loan Document or Counter-Guarantee or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document or
Counter-Guarantee (collectively, "Other Taxes") to the Agent for the account of
the affected party.

          (d) Tax Indemnity. The Obligors will indemnify each Lender, the Agent,
each Counter-Guarantor and the Loan Administrator for the full amount of
Indemnified Taxes, Counter-Guarantee Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.11) paid by
such Lender, the Loan Administrator, each Counter-Guarantor or the Agent (as the
case may be) and any liability (including for penalties, interest and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, other than any liability, including
for penalties, interest and expenses, arising from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Lender, the Loan Administrator, each Counter-Guarantor
or the Agent, as the case may be. This indemnification shall be made to the
Agent for account of the relevant Lender, Counter-Guarantor, the Loan
Administrator or the Agent, as the case may be, within 30 days from the date
such Lender, the Loan Administrator, Counter-Guarantor or the Agent (as the case
may be) makes written demand therefor (with a copy to the Agent if made by a
Lender, Counter-Guarantor or the Loan Administrator and accompanied by a
statement setting forth the basis for such taxation and the calculation of the
amount thereof in reasonable detail).

          (e) Evidence of Payment. Within 30 days after the date of any payment
of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the Obligors will furnish to the Agent the
original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or other
documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

          (f) Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of the Obligors hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the parties
contained in this Section 2.11 shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations.

          (g) Certain Withholding Tax Matters. Each Lender, each
Counter-Guarantor, each Participant, the Loan Administrator and the Agent that
is a Non-U.S. Person and that is entitled at such time to an exemption from
United States withholding tax, or that is subject to such tax at a reduced rate
under an applicable tax treaty, shall, on or prior to the Effective Date or on
or prior to the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
becomes a Lender or on or prior to the date such Person becomes a
Counter-Guarantor, a Participant, the Loan Administrator or the Agent, as
applicable, and from time to time thereafter if requested by the Agent, a
Counter-Guarantor or the Obligors, provide the Agent and the Obligors, and, in
the case of each Lender, each Participant and the Agent, provide each
Counter-Guarantor, with two completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI
or other applicable form, certificate or document prescribed by the IRS
certifying as to such Non-U.S. Person's entitlement to such exemption from
United States withholding tax or reduced rate with respect to all payments to be
made to such Non-U.S. Person under the Loan Documents. In addition, each Lender,
each Counter-Guarantor, each Participant, the Loan Administrator and the Agent
that is a Non-U.S. Person, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Obligors and
the Agent, and, in the case of each Lender, each Participant and the Agent,
deliver to each Counter-Guarantor, notice of any event (other than a change in
applicable law, including income tax conventions) requiring a change in the most
recent form previously delivered by such Person to the Obligors and the Agent or
the Counter-Guarantors, as the case may be. Each Lender, each Counter-Guarantor,
each Participant, the Loan Administrator and Agent (other than an entity treated
as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is a "United States
person" within the meaning


                                       49

<PAGE>

of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code shall deliver two duly
signed and completed copies of IRS Form W-9 to the Agent and the Obligors, at
the times and in the manner described above with respect to IRS Forms W-8.
Unless the Agent and the Obligors have received forms or other documents
satisfactory to them indicating that payments under the Loan Documents or
Counter-Guarantee to or for a Non-U.S. Person are not subject to United States
withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by an applicable
tax treaty, the Agent or the Obligors shall, notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 2.11(a), (b) and (d) and without impairing any obligation of the
Obligors under this Section 2.11 with respect to such tax, withhold such United
States withholding taxes from such payments at the appropriate rate; provided
that if such Person is a Lender, Counter-Guarantor, Participant, Agent or Loan
Administrator and shall have satisfied the requirement of this Section 2.11(g)
on the date it became a Lender, Counter-Guarantor, Participant, Agent or Loan
Administrator, nothing in this Section 2.11(g) shall relieve the Obligors of
their obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to this Section 2.11 in the event
that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental
rule, regulation or order, or any change in governmental interpretation,
administration or application thereof, such Lender, Counter-Guarantor,
Participant, Agent or Loan Administrator is no longer properly entitled to
deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing
that it is not subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced
rate. The obligation of the Obligors under this Section 2.11 shall survive the
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the Agent.

          (h) Mitigation. Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall use its reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid
the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts which would
be payable or may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of
such Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

          (i) Participants. Each Participant will be entitled to the benefits
and subject to the requirements of this Section 2.11 to the same extent as if
such Person were a Lender.

          To induce the other parties (excluding any other Obligors) to enter
into this Agreement and to induce the Counter-Guarantors to amend and restate
their respective Counter-Guarantees, each of the Obligors represents and
warrants to each other party hereto (excluding any other Obligors) and to each
Counter-Guarantor that, on and as of the Effective Date, after giving effect to
the Consummation of the Plan (references to "Obligors" contained in this Article
IV shall be limited to Obligors as of the Effective Date):

          SECTION 4.1. ORGANIZATION, POWERS, QUALIFICATION, GOOD STANDING,
BUSINESS, SUBSIDIARIES, THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS.

          (a) Organization, Power and Authority. Each Obligor is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization. Each Obligor has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own and operate its properties, to carry on its


                                       54

business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to enter into the
Loan Documents to which it is a party and to carry out the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

          (b) Foreign Qualification; "Air Carrier Status". Each Obligor is
qualified to do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction where its
assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out its business and
operations, except in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Borrower is an "air carrier" within the meaning of the Act and holds
a certificate under Section 41102 of Title 49. Each of the Borrower and any
other Obligor engaged in operations as an "air carrier" is a "citizen of the
United States" within the meaning of Section 40102(a)(15) of Title 49, as
interpreted by the United States Department of Transportation (a "United States
Citizen") and holds an air carrier operating certificate issued pursuant to
Chapter 447 of Title 49 for aircraft capable of carrying 10 or more individuals
or 6,000 pounds or more of cargo. Each Obligor possesses all necessary
certificates, franchises, licenses, permits, rights and concessions and consents
which are material to the conduct of its business and operations as currently
conducted (including in the case of each Obligor engaged in operations as an
"air carrier", the operation of the routes flown by it), a true and complete
list of which are set forth on Schedule 4.1(b).

          (c) Subsidiaries. All of the Subsidiaries of each Obligor and all
other Persons in which any Obligor owns any Capital Stock, in each case, as of
the Effective Date, are identified in Schedule 4.1(c). Schedule 4.1(c) correctly
sets forth as of the Effective Date the equity and voting interest of Group in
each of the Subsidiaries identified therein. There are no limitations on the
rights of Group to vote the Capital Stock it owns of any Person listed on
Schedule 4.1(c). Airways Assurance Limited, a Bermuda corporation, is a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Group whose business is limited to securing insurance
for the Obligors. AWHQ LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, is a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Obligors, owned 99% by Holdings and 1% by the
Borrower, whose business is limited to acting as a real estate holding company.
America West Company Store LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, is a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Borrower whose business is limited to operation
of the America West company store.

          SECTION 4.2. AUTHORIZATION OF LOAN DOCUMENTS, ETC.

          (a) Authorization. Each Obligor has duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents
to which it is a party.

          (b) No Conflicts. After giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan,
the execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor of the Loan Documents
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents to
which it is a party do not and will not (i) violate any provision of any law or
any governmental rule or regulation applicable to any Obligor, the certificate
or articles of incorporation or bylaws of any Obligor or any order, judgment or
decree of any court or other agency of government binding on any Obligor, (ii)
conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default or require any payment under (A) any Loan Document or
(B) any other Contractual Obligation of any Obligor, except that with respect to
clause (B), for any such conflict, breach, default or requirement of payment
which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (iii)
result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of any Obligor (other than the Liens created under the
Collateral Documents) or (iv) require any approval of stockholders or any
approval or consent of any Person under any Contractual Obligation of any
Obligor, except for such approvals or consents (A) which will have been obtained
on or before the Effective Date and have been disclosed in writing to the Agent,
the Initial Lender, each Counter-Guarantor and the Board or (B) with respect to
any Contractual Obligation, which if not obtained, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


                                       55

<PAGE>

          (c) No Consents, Approvals, etc. The execution, delivery and
performance by each Obligor of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents to which
such Obligor is a party do not and will not require any registration with,
consent or approval of, or notice to, or other action to, with or by, any
federal, state or other Governmental Authority or regulatory body or any other
Person which is required to be obtained or made on or prior to the Effective
Date and which has not been obtained or made, except as is disclosed on Schedule
4.2(c).

          (d) Execution, Delivery, Enforceability. Each Obligor has duly
executed and delivered each of the Loan Documents to which it is party and after
giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan, each such Loan Document is the
valid and binding obligation of such Obligor, enforceable against such Obligor
in accordance with its respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar
laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally,
including materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law).

          SECTION 4.3. FINANCIAL CONDITION.

          (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered to the Agent, the Board,
each Counter-Guarantor and the Loan Administrator (i) the audited consolidated

AWA Holdings and the Borrower as at June 30, 2005 and the related unaudited

accompanied by footnotes) and fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of such Persons as at the date thereof and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows of such Person for the period
then ended.

          (b) After giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan, (i) the
Obligors taken as a whole are Solvent and (ii) no Obligor has any material
liability, including reasonably likely contingent liability or liability for
taxes, long-term lease or any unusual forward or long-term commitment of a type
required to be reflected in financial statements prepared in conformity with
GAAP, that is not reflected in the projections and pro forma financial
information delivered pursuant to clause (n) of Article III or, in the case of a
Reporting Obligor, taken into account in the preparation of the annual report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 of such Reporting Obligor.

          (c) Each Reporting Obligor maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Obligors and has (i) caused such disclosure
controls and procedures to be designed to ensure that material information

disclosure controls and procedures and presented as required in the Reporting
Obligors' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended December 31,
2004, conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures, and (iv) disclosed as required in such Annual Report any change in
such internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the relevant
reporting period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, their internal control over financial reporting.

          (d) Other than as disclosed on Schedule 4.3(d) or as disclosed in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2004 of any
Obligor, no Obligor is a party to any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (within
the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as amended by SEC Release No. 33-8182 (January 28, 2003)).

          SECTION 4.4. NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE; NO RESTRICTED PAYMENTS. Since
August 9, 2005, no material adverse change has occurred in the financial
condition, assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of the
Obligors, taken as a whole (excluding any such changes resulting from (i)
changes or conditions generally affecting the U.S. economy or financial markets,
(ii) changes or conditions generally affecting any of the segments of the
airline industry in which any of the Obligors operate, to the extent such
conditions or changes do not disproportionately impact the Obligors, or (iii)
the announcement or consummation of the Merger), or in the Borrower's ability to
repay the Loan or perform its obligations under the Loan Documents or with
respect to the matters included in the financial projections delivered to the
Board and the Agent on July 28, 2005. Since August 9, 2005, no Obligor has
directly or indirectly declared, ordered, paid or made, or set apart any sum or
property for, any Restricted Payment or agreed to do so except as would have
been permitted by Section 6.3, as if such section were in effect at all times
after such date. After giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan, no event
or occurrence which would constitute a Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing.

          SECTION 4.5. TITLE TO PROPERTIES; LIENS. Each Obligor has (i) good and
insurable fee title to (in the case of fee interests in real property), (ii)
valid, and in the case of leasehold interests in real property, insurable,
leasehold interests in (in the case of leasehold interests in real or personal
property) or (iii) good title to (in the case of all other personal property)
all of the properties and assets necessary to the conduct of its business
including property and assets reflected in the financial statements referred to
in Section 4.3, except for assets disposed of since the date of such financial
statements in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to the restructuring
contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization. Except as otherwise permitted by
this Agreement and the Collateral Documents, all such properties and assets are
free and clear of Liens.

          SECTION 4.6. LITIGATION; ADVERSE FACTS. There are no actions, suits,
proceedings, arbitrations or investigations (whether or not purportedly on
behalf of Group, the Borrower or any other Obligor) at law or in equity or
before or by any Governmental Authority pending or, to the knowledge of any
Responsible Officer of any Principal Obligor, threatened against or affecting
(in either case, whether asserted or unasserted) any of the Obligors or any
property of the Obligors that, individually or in the aggregate, (a) except for
matters disclosed on Schedule 4.6, in the reasonable judgment of the Obligors
could be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) challenge the
legality, validity or binding effect of, or seeks to restrain or enjoin any
Obligor from entering into or performing under, any Loan Document including,
without limitation, this Agreement or any Collateral Document. No Obligor is
subject to any final judgments, writs, injunctions or decrees of any court or
any Governmental Authority, compliance with which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, or is in default with respect to any such
judgments, writs, injunctions or decrees, which default could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.7. PAYMENT OF TAXES.

          (a) Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 4.7(a): (i) the Obligors
have timely filed all material Tax returns and reports required to have been
filed, and have paid or made adequate provision for payment of all material
Taxes levied or imposed upon them or their properties (including the
Collateral), income or assets that have become due and payable, except (A) in
those instances in which such Taxes are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and for which adequate reserves
have been made in accordance with GAAP and (B) that the Debtors' obligations to
pay Taxes that relate to a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases and which first became due and payable
after the time of the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases, have been stayed or
enjoined pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the Confirmation Order or the
Bankruptcy Code, it being understood that the exception in this clause (B) does
not affect the Obligors' representation that they have made adequate provision
for such Taxes; (ii) there is no proposed Tax assessment against any Obligor
that relates to a material amount of Taxes, and neither Group nor the Borrower
knows of any basis for any such assessment; and (iii) no Obligor is party to any
Tax sharing agreement with any Person other than another Obligor, other than tax
indemnity agreements in leasing transactions entered into in the ordinary course
of business.

          (b) Schedule 4.7(b) is a true and complete list of each claim of a
governmental unit of the kind entitled to priority in payment, as specified in
section 502(i) and 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, that the Debtors will or
expect to pay or to be required to pay during the six (6) years immediately
following the Effective Date.

          SECTION 4.8. PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS; MATERIALLY ADVERSE AGREEMENTS.

          (a) No Default. After giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan,
no Obligor is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any
Contractual Obligations other than defaults which are not reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, and no condition exists that, with the giving of
notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default; it being
understood that the existence on the Effective Date of any default under (i)
certain executory contracts and unexpired leases that the Obligors are entitled
to reject in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization or prior order of the
Bankruptcy Court and (ii) certain other contracts relating to property that any
Obligor has abandoned pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court shall be
deemed not to be a breach of this Section 4.8(a).

          (b) No Adverse Agreements. No Obligor is a party to or is otherwise
subject to any agreements or instruments or any charter or other internal
restrictions which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to impair the ability of the Obligors, taken as a whole, to perform
their payment or other material obligations under the Loan Documents.

          (c) Other Agreements. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.8(c), no
Obligor is a party to or is otherwise subject to any agreement or arrangement,
including, but not limited to, agreements relating to Indebtedness, lease
agreements or Guarantees, that provide for early payment, additional collateral
support, changes in terms or acceleration of maturity, or the creation of an
additional financial obligation, as a result of any of (i) an adverse change in
the credit rating of an Obligor, (ii) an adverse change in the financial ratios,
earnings, cash flow or stock price of an Obligor or (iii) changes in the value
of underlying, linked or indexed assets, except to the extent that such
agreements or arrangements could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.9. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. No Obligor is subject to
regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act or the Investment Company Act


                                       58

<PAGE>

of 1940 or under any other federal or state statute or regulation (other than
the Bankruptcy Code) which may limit its ability to incur Indebtedness or which
may otherwise render all or any portion of its Obligations unenforceable.

          SECTION 4.10. SECURITIES ACTIVITIES. No Obligor owns or is engaged
principally in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any Margin Stock (as defined below), and no proceeds of the Loan were
used to purchase or carry Margin Stock or to extend credit to any Person for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock in a manner that violated or
caused a violation of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board of Governors. For
purposes of this Section 4.10, the term "Margin Stock" has the meaning assigned
to that term in Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System as in effect from time to time.

          SECTION 4.11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

          (a) Schedule 4.11(a) lists each Plan and each Multiemployer Plan
maintained or contributed to, or required to be contributed to, by Group or any
of its ERISA Affiliates as of the Effective Date. Each Plan has been operated
and administered in compliance with all applicable requirements of ERISA, and,
if intended to qualify under Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, in compliance with all applicable requirements of such provisions except
where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have, taking all
instances in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.;

          (b) Full payment has been made by Group or any of its ERISA Affiliates
of all minimum amounts which such entities are required to pay under the terms
of each Plan and Multiemployer Plan except where the failure to so comply,
taking all instances in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.;

          (c) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
that, when taken together with all other ERISA Events for which liability is
reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.;

          (d) Neither Group nor any of its ERISA Affiliates maintains or
contributes to any employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) which provides benefits to retired employees or other former employees
(other than as required by Section 601 of ERISA) or any employee pension benefit
plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), other than a Plan the obligations
with respect to which, when taken together with the projected contributions
thereto reflected in the projections and pro forma financial information
delivered pursuant to clause (n) of Article III, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.;

          (e) After giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan, no Plan
maintained by Group or any ERISA Affiliate is underfunded (based on the present
value of all accumulated benefit obligations thereunder) except to the extent
that the aggregate amount of underfunding with respect to all such plans, when
taken together with the projected contributions thereto reflected in the
projections and pro forma financial information delivered pursuant to clause (n)
of Article III, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect during the scheduled term of the Loan.

          SECTION 4.12. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

          (a) Compliance with Environmental Laws. All Facilities and operations
of each Obligor are, and have been to the knowledge of each Principal Obligor,
in compliance with all


                                       59

<PAGE>

Environmental Laws except for any noncompliance which, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) Hazardous Materials Activity. Except as disclosed on Schedule
4.12(b), there are no, and have been no, conditions, occurrences, or Hazardous
Materials Activity (i) arising at any Facilities or (ii) arising in connection
with the operations of the Obligors or of past or current Affiliates of any
Obligor (while under the control of a Principal Obligor or otherwise to the
knowledge of a Principal Obligor) (including the transportation of Hazardous
Materials in accordance with applicable regulations), which conditions,
occurrences or Hazardous Materials Activity could reasonably be expected to form
the basis of an Environmental Claim against any Obligor and which, individually
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          (c) Environmental Claims. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.12(c),
there are no pending or, to the knowledge of any Principal Obligor, threatened
Environmental Claims against any Obligor, and no Principal Obligor has received
any notices, inquiries, or requests for information with respect to any
Environmental Claims which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

          (d) Orders, Decrees, etc. No Obligor is currently operating or
required to be operating under any compliance order, schedule, decree or
agreement, any consent decree, order or agreement, and/or any corrective action
decree, order or agreement issued or entered into under any Environmental Law
the failure to comply with which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.13. DISCLOSURE.

          (a) No representation or warranty or certification of any Obligor or
of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower or Group or any other Officer of any
Obligor contained in this Agreement, any other Loan Document or in any other
document, certificate or written statement furnished to the Board, the Agent,
any Counter-Guarantor or the Lenders by or on behalf of any Obligor (as modified
or supplemented by other written information so furnished) for use in connection
with the negotiation and closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein at the time, and in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that
with respect to projected financial information contained in any such document
or furnished to any party hereto by or on behalf of the Obligors, the Obligors
represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being recognized that such
projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual
results during the period or periods covered thereby may differ from the
projected results.

          (b) None of the Reporting Obligors' filings under the Exchange Act (as
amended or supplemented through the date hereof) nor the Disclosure Statement
(as amended or supplemented through the date hereof) contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

          SECTION 4.14. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each Obligor is in compliance with
all laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders binding on or applicable to
such Obligor, and all of its properties,


                                       60

<PAGE>

except to the extent failure to so comply (either individually or in the
aggregate) could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.15. INDEBTEDNESS. Schedule 4.15 correctly sets forth the
consolidated Indebtedness of Group and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date
and identifies each primary obligor and each guarantor or other secondary
obligor thereof, if any.

          SECTION 4.16. INSURANCE. The properties, business and operations of
the Obligors are insured or reinsured with financially sound and reputable
insurance companies or by the United States of America, in such amounts, with
such deductibles and covering such risks as are insured against (including, but
not limited to, war risk and third party liability) and carried in accordance
with applicable law and prudent industry practice by major U.S. commercial air
carriers similarly situated with the Obligors and owning or operating similar
properties, aircraft and engines.

          SECTION 4.17. PERFECTED SECURITY INTERESTS. The Collateral Agent, on
behalf of the Lenders, the Counter-Guarantors and the Board, has valid security
interests in the Collateral, with such priority and perfected to such extent as
is provided in the Collateral Documents.

          SECTION 4.18. COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. No Obligor
is in default with respect to any material obligation under the Plan of the
Reorganization.

          SECTION 4.19. ABSENCE OF LABOR DISPUTES. No strikes, boycotts, work
stoppages or lockouts with respect to any of the Obligors exist, and no Obligor
has received written notice, sanctioned by any collective bargaining unit
representing employees of such Obligor, threatening a strike, boycott or work
stoppage.

          SECTION 4.20. COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN GATE LEASES. After giving effect
to the Consummation of the Plan, each Obligor is in compliance in all material
respects with all Gate Leases with respect to the airports listed on Schedule
4.20.

          SECTION 4.21. SLOT UTILIZATION. Each Obligor which holds or operates
Slots is utilizing its Slots in a manner consistent with the Slot Regulations in
order to avoid the withdrawal of any Slot (other than Slots of the type
referenced in clauses (f) through (i) of the definition of "Secondary Slots") by
the FAA, taking into account any waivers or other relief granted by the FAA in
connection with the failure to utilize Slots. None of the Obligors has received
any notice of withdrawal from the FAA, nor (other than with respect to Slots of
the type referenced in clauses (d) and (f) through (i) of the definition of
"Secondary Slots") is any Obligor aware of any other event or circumstance
(other than any proposed change of law, regulation or rule, including the
scheduled removal of slot restrictions at John F. Kennedy International Airport
and LGA on January 1, 2007), that could reasonably be expected to result in the
withdrawal of any Slot or otherwise impair any of the Slots or the value thereof
(it being understood, however, that the Slot Regulations provide for withdrawal
in certain circumstances other than for failure to utilize Slots, and the FAA
has asserted the right to withdraw and reallocate "pool" Slots (within the
meaning of 14 C.F.R. Section 93.226(e)), including those identified on Schedule
1.1(a) hereto, at its discretion). The Obligors maintain personnel, policies,
procedures and a computer database for the monitoring, utilization and
management of the Slots in compliance with the Slot Regulations so as to ensure,
to the greatest extent operationally feasible, that the Slot Regulations are
complied with and no Slot becomes subject to withdrawal by the FAA.

          SECTION 4.22. DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AND SECURITIES ACCOUNTS. Schedule 4.22
contains a true, complete and correct list of all deposits accounts and
securities accounts of the Obligors, including, with respect to each account,
the name of such account, the account number, the bank or financial


                                       61

institution with which such account is maintained, and the balance therein as of
a specified date (which shall be no earlier than August 31, 2005), indicating
thereon whether each such account is subject to a Control Agreement in favor of
the Collateral Agent.

          SECTION 4.23. UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. After the
Consummation of the Plan, the Obligors have on a pro forma basis as of the
Effective Date, taking into account net cash proceeds of the Stock Offering, the
Convertible Note Offering, the Juniper Financing and the Airbus Financing
expected to be received within seven (7) days of the Effective Date,
unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents (as determined in accordance with GAAP)
of not less than $1,250,000,000.

                                    ARTICLE V

                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

their respective Counter-Guarantees, the Obligors agree with each other party
hereto (excluding any other Obligor) and the Counter-Guarantors that, so long as

shall provide a copy of such notice, report, certificate or other information to
each Lender and Counter-Guarantor (which may be sent by e-mail), other than a

receive any such notice, report, certificate or other information.

          SECTION 5.2. CORPORATE EXISTENCE. Except as permitted by Section 6.9,
each Obligor will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and
keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and the corporate,
partnership or other existence of each Obligor and the material rights, permits,
licenses (charter and statutory) and franchises of each Obligor; provided that
subject to Section 5.10, no Obligor shall be required to preserve any such
right, permit, license or franchise, and, subject to compliance with Section
6.9, as applicable, no Obligor shall be required to preserve any such corporate,
partnership or other existence, if in each case, the Chief Executive Officer of
Group or the Borrower shall determine in the exercise of his or her business
judgment that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of
the business of the Obligors taken as a whole and that abandonment of any such
right, permit, license or franchise or failure to preserve such existence could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 5.3. PAYMENT OF TAXES AND CLAIMS. Each Obligor will pay or
discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become
delinquent, (i) all material Taxes levied or imposed upon an Obligor or upon the
income, profits or property of an Obligor except (a) that this Section 5.3 shall
not require the Obligors who were debtors in the Bankruptcy Cases to pay Taxes
that relate to a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases and which first became due and payable
after the time of the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases, to the extent that,
and for so long as, such Taxes are stayed or enjoined pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, the Confirmation Order or the Bankruptcy Code, it being
understood that


                                       67

<PAGE>

notwithstanding the exception in this clause (a), such Obligors shall make
adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP for Taxes stayed or enjoined pursuant
to the Plan of Reorganization, the Confirmation Order or the Bankruptcy Code, or
(b) where the amount, applicability or validity of such Taxes are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been made in accordance with GAAP and (ii) all lawful claims for
labor, materials and supplies that, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien on the
property of an Obligor. No Obligor will file or consent to the filing of, any
consolidated income tax return with any Person (other than any other Obligor or
any Subsidiary of any Obligor).

          SECTION 5.4. MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES; INSURANCE.

          (a) Maintenance of Properties. Each Obligor will maintain all
properties used or useful in the conduct of the business of the Obligors in good
condition, repair and working order (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and supply
such properties with all necessary equipment and make all necessary repairs,
renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereto, all as in the
reasonable judgment of an Obligor may be necessary so that the business carried
on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all
times; provided, however, that no Obligor shall be restricted from discontinuing
the operation and maintenance of any such properties if such discontinuance is,
in the good faith judgment of Group, desirable in the conduct of the business of
such Obligor and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, but subject in each case to all applicable provisions of the Collateral
Documents.

          (b) Insurance. Each Obligor will insure and keep insured or reinsured
with financially sound and reputable insurance companies that are not Affiliates
of the Obligors or by the United States of America, their businesses and
operations and such of their respective properties, in such amounts, with such
deductibles and covering such risks as are insured against (including, but not
limited to, war risk and third party liability) and carried in accordance with
applicable law and prudent industry practice by U.S. commercial air carriers
similarly situated with the Obligors and owning or operating similar properties,
aircraft and engines, including such insurance coverage as is required to be
maintained under the Collateral Documents, and providing for not less than
thirty (30) days' (or in the case of war risk coverage, the maximum time as is
available) prior notice to the Agent, the Board, the Loan Administrator and the
Collateral Agent of termination, lapse or cancellation of such insurance or
reinsurance; provided that this Section 5.4(b) shall not prohibit any Obligor
from procuring and maintaining all or any portion of its insurance through
Airways Assurance Limited LLC so long as Airways Assurance Limited LLC reinsures
100% of such risk as provided above in this Section 5.4(b) and such reinsurance
policies contain a cut-through endorsement.

          SECTION 5.5. INSPECTION. Each Obligor will permit any authorized
representatives designated by the Agent, any Lender, the Loan Administrator, any
Counter-Guarantor or the Board to visit and inspect any of the properties of the
Obligors, including their financial and accounting records, and to make copies
and take extracts therefrom, and to discuss their affairs, finances and accounts
with its and their officers and independent public accountants (it being
understood that a representative of an Obligor will be present), at the
Borrower's expense, all upon reasonable notice and at such reasonable times
during normal business hours and as often as may be reasonably requested;
provided that so long as the Controlling Creditor is not exercising material
remedies under the Loan Documents, such inspection shall not be disruptive to
the business of the Obligors. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Obligors will meet with the Loan Administrator on a quarterly basis (in
person or, if deemed appropriate by the Loan Administrator, telephonically) to
review the Obligors' financial and accounting records and will make their
officers and independent public accountants available to discuss with the Loan
Administrator the Obligors' affairs, financial condition, results of operations,
business plan, prospects, projections, accounts and other related matters
(including, without limitation, the integration of


                                       68

<PAGE>

the Borrower and US Airways), and otherwise will cooperate with the Loan
Administrator and provide such information as it may reasonably request to
enable it to perform the services described in the Loan Administration
Agreement.

          SECTION 5.6. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC. Each Obligor will comply with
all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders, restrictions and
Governmental Authorizations of any applicable Governmental Authority, in respect
of the conduct of the businesses of the Obligors and the ownership of their
respective properties (including, without limitation, Gate Leases and Slots),
except such as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
except for such noncompliance as could not in any case or in the aggregate
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Obligors
shall conduct any Hazardous Materials Activity at any Facility or at any other
location in a manner that does not comply in all material respects with
Environmental Laws. Each Obligor will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all other Persons operating or occupying any of their properties to comply
in all material respects with Environmental Laws.

          SECTION 5.7. REMEDIAL ACTION REGARDING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.

          (a) To the extent required by Environmental Laws, each Obligor will
take any and all necessary remedial action (except to the extent that such
remedial action is taken by other Persons responsible for such remedial action
through contractual arrangements with an Obligor) in connection with the
presence, storage, use, disposal, transportation, Release or threatened Release
of any Hazardous Materials on, under or about any Facility in order to comply
timely with all applicable Environmental Laws and Governmental Authorizations
except for such non-compliance as could not in any case or in the aggregate
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. In the event any
Obligor undertakes any remedial action with respect to any Hazardous Materials
on, under or about any Facility, Group, Borrower or such Obligor will conduct
and complete such remedial action (or will cause such action to be taken
pursuant to contractual rights of such Obligor against third parties) in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, and in accordance with the
policies, orders and directives of all federal, state and local Governmental
Authorities except when, and only to the extent that, such Obligor's liability
for such presence, storage, use, disposal, transportation or discharge of any
Hazardous Materials is being contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings diligently conducted by such Obligor or except for such
non-compliance as could not in any case or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) The Requisite Lenders or the Board may request (i) from time to
time, if and when such Person(s) have reason to believe that an Environmental
Claim or Release of Hazardous Materials which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect may exist at or with respect to any Facility, and
(ii) not more than once during any twelve month period for the purpose of
determining whether there is belief that an Environmental Claim or Release of
Hazardous Materials which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect exists at or with respect to any Facility, and in the case of any
such request, the Borrower will provide to the Lenders and the Board, within
sixty (60) days after such request, at the expense of the Borrower, an
environmental site assessment report for any of its, or any other Obligor's
properties described in such request, prepared by an environmental consulting
firm reasonably acceptable to the Board evaluating the Environmental Claim or
Release of Hazardous Materials and estimating the cost of any required
compliance, removal or remedial action in connection with the Environmental
Claim or Release of Hazardous Materials. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing clause (b), if the Agent determines at any time that a material risk
exists that any such report will not be provided in the time referred to above,
the Agent may retain an environmental consulting firm to prepare such report at
the expense of the Borrower, and each Obligor hereby agrees to grant at the time
of such request, to the Agent, the Lenders, the Board, such firm and any


                                       69

<PAGE>

agents or representatives thereof an irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject
to the rights of tenants, to enter into their respective properties to undertake
such an assessment.

          SECTION 5.8. ADDITIONAL OBLIGORS; COLLATERAL.

          (a) With reasonable promptness (and in any event within 30 days)
following the formation or acquisition by any Obligor of a Subsidiary or of any
Capital Stock of any other Person, the Borrower (i) shall provide the Agent, the
Loan Administrator, the Counter-Guarantors, and the Board the name, corporate
structure and allocation of Voting Stock and equity interests of such Subsidiary
or other Person, (ii) in the case of any such Subsidiary that is not a CFC,
shall cause such Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Agent and the Board a
Subsidiary Joinder in the form of Exhibit M hereto, pursuant to which such
Subsidiary shall become a party to this Agreement, and a joinder to the Second
Lien Guaranty pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall become a guarantor
thereunder, and (iii) shall deliver to the Agent and the Board documents of the
types referred to in clauses (a)(x) and (a)(xi) of Article III, all in form,
content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and the Board.

          (b) Each Obligor (including, without limitation, each Subsidiary
created or acquired after the Effective Date that is required to be a Subsidiary
Guarantor) will cause all of its properties and assets as of the Effective Date
(or the date such Person was created or acquired) and all properties and assets
acquired thereafter (including, without limitation, the Capital Stock of each
Subsidiary created or acquired and the Capital Stock of each other Person
acquired after the Effective Date) other than Excluded Property to be pledged to
the Collateral Agent on a perfected first priority basis (subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Liens permitted by Section 6.1, including the
prior Liens securing the First Lien Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement)) to secure the Obligations; provided that if the Borrower or another
Obligor enters into an agreement to finance any pledged After-Acquired Section
1110 Equipment, the Collateral Agent shall, and is hereby directed to, release
its Lien on such After-Acquired Section 1110 Equipment upon its receipt from the
Borrower (with a copy to the Agent and the Board) of an Officer's Certificate
describing in reasonable detail the Section 1110 Equipment proposed to be
financed and certifying that such transaction complies with this Section.

          (c) The Borrower shall obtain one or more Appraisal Reports
establishing the value of the Appraised Collateral as of (i) the last day of
each Fiscal Year beginning December 31, 2005, (ii) the date upon which any
additional property or assets that constitutes Appraised Collateral is pledged
as Collateral to the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 5.8(d) to secure the
Obligations, but only with respect to such additional Collateral, (iii) in
connection with a Replacement Secured Financing of aircraft and spare engines,
and (iv) no more than once during any twelve (12) month period, a date which is
no later than 60 days after the Controlling Creditor has requested that the
Borrower obtain an Appraisal Report (it being understood that the obligation
herein of the Borrower to periodically obtain Appraisal Reports shall be in
addition to any rights or obligations under the Collateral Documents); provided
that no more than one Appraisal Report shall be required with respect to any
item of Appraised Collateral within any 60 day period. Such Appraisal Reports
may be based on desktop appraisals unless the Controlling Creditor shall have
requested that an Appraisal Report be based on physical inspection.

          (d) If as of the end of any fiscal quarter (each such date a
"Collateral Value Test Date") there exists a Collateral Value Deficiency, the
Borrower shall do one of the following to the extent (but only to the extent)
necessary to eliminate such Collateral Value Deficiency: (i) prepay the Loan in
an amount equal to Group's Adjusted Excess Cash Flow for the period commencing
on the Effective Date and ending on such Collateral Value Test Date (which
payment shall be made on the Interest Payment Date first occurring on or after
delivery of the Collateral Value Certificate that evidences such Collateral
Value Deficiency); (ii) pledge additional Eligible Collateral to the Collateral
Agent pursuant to a Collateral Document Supplement or other Collateral Document,
in each case on terms and conditions as


                                       70

are reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, the Board and the Collateral Agent, or
(iii) prepay the Loan as provided in clause (i) above and pledge additional
Eligible Collateral as provided in clause (ii) above; provided that if Group's
Adjusted Excess Cash Flow for such period, together with all Eligible Collateral
that is available to be pledged is not sufficient to eliminate such Collateral
Value Deficiency, the Borrower shall continue to prepay the Loan in an amount
equal to Group's Adjusted Excess Cash Flow for the period commencing on the
Effective Date and ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter following the
Collateral Value Test Date as of which the Collateral Value Deficiency was
established (which payments shall be made on the Interest Payment Dates
respectively relating to the Interest Periods first occurring after each such
fiscal quarter) and pledge all additional Eligible Collateral to the Collateral
Agent as it becomes available until the Collateral Value Deficiency no longer
exists (whether as a result of prepayments of the Loan, pledge of additional
collateral, or increase in Collateral Value or any combination of the
foregoing). The foregoing notwithstanding, the Borrower shall not be required to
prepay the Loan or pledge additional Eligible Collateral as provided above if
and to the extent that US Airways or any other Obligor is required to prepay the
US Airways Loan or pledge additional Eligible Collateral pursuant to the US
Airways Loan Agreement to cure a Collateral Value Deficiency thereunder (and as
defined therein).

          (e) If additional Collateral is being pledged in accordance with
Section 5.8(d), such additional Collateral shall be free and clear of any Liens
(other than as permitted under the applicable Collateral Document) and the
pledgor(s) shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent such applicable
Collateral Document Supplements or Collateral Documents (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and the Board) necessary to grant a
security interest (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) to the Collateral
Agent and shall take all other actions (as are in the reasonable judgment of the
Agent or the Controlling Creditor) necessary or desirable to cause the Liens
created thereby to be perfected first priority Liens under applicable law
(subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and except as otherwise provided under
the applicable Collateral Document), and, if requested by the Controlling
Creditor, furnish favorable legal opinions to the Collateral Agent with respect
to such additional Collateral, including the perfection and priority of the
Collateral Agent's Lien thereon and evidence of applicable filings to the Loan
Administrator, and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of the applicable
Collateral Documents that apply to a pledge of such Collateral.

          (f) In connection with each prepayment or pledge of additional
Eligible Collateral pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section 5.8, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Collateral Agent, the Loan Administrator and the Board
either (i) a Collateral Value Certificate which establishes that the applicable
Collateral Value Deficiency no longer exists, or (ii) an Officer's Certificate
of Group that certifies (A) the amount of Group's Excess Cash Flow since the
Effective Date, and (B) that Group has identified to the Collateral Agent and
the Board all of its material property (other than Excluded Property) that is
not subject to a Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent under a Collateral
Document.

          (g) Any partial prepayment of the Loan under subsection (d) of this
Section 5.8 shall be applied as provided in Section 2.5(j). Any such prepayment
shall be paid to the Agent for application as provided in Section 2.8.

          (h) No later than ninety (90) days after the Effective Date, the
Borrower shall cause the applicable Obligor to grant a first priority mortgage
(subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Liens permitted by Section 6.1,
including the prior Liens securing the First Lien Obligations (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement)) in the real property located at 250 W. Rio Salado
Parkway, Tempe, Arizona 85281 and known as the Penny Saver Building for the
benefit of the Collateral Agent. Such mortgage shall be substantially in the
form of Exhibit H hereto (with such other changes which result from the
application of Arizona law thereto and other changes necessary to reflect the
fee ownership thereof).

          SECTION 5.9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Each Obligor will ensure that the
Plans and Multiemployer Plans with respect to which the Obligors may have any
liability are operated in compliance with all applicable laws, except to the
extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 5.10. FAA MATTERS; CITIZENSHIP. The Borrower shall at all
times hereunder be an "air carrier" within the meaning of the Act and hold a
certificate under 49 U.S.C. Section 41102(a)(1) as currently in effect or as may
be amended or recodified from time to time. The Borrower and each other Obligor
engaged in operations as an "air carrier" will at all times hereunder be a
United States Citizen holding an air carrier operating certificate issued

the Board, the Loan Administrator and the Agent (with a copy to the
Counter-Guarantors) all such information as may be reasonably requested by the
Board, the Loan Administrator or the Agent in connection with the Board
Guaranty. Each Obligor will execute such documents and take such actions in
furtherance of its obligations under the Act and the Regulations as the Board,
the Loan Administrator or the Agent may request.

          SECTION 5.12. AUDITS AND REVIEWS. Each Obligor will permit and
cooperate in the conduct of such audits and reviews during the period that both
(i) the Loan is outstanding and (ii) the Board is a guarantor of Tranche A or a
Lender hereunder, and for three (3) years thereafter, as the Board may deem
appropriate, by an independent auditor acceptable to the Board or the United
States Comptroller General. To the extent requested by the Board or the Loan
Administrator, each Obligor will provide reasonable access to the officers and
employees, books, records, accounts, documents, correspondence, and other
information of the Obligors, financial advisors, consultants and independent
certified accountants that the Board or the United States Comptroller General
considers necessary.

          SECTION 5.13. CONTROL OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AND SECURITIES ACCOUNTS.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.13, the Obligors shall maintain
deposit accounts and securities accounts (other than with respect to Excluded
Cash) only with banks or financial institutions with which they and the
Collateral Agent have entered into control agreements in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and the Controlling Creditor
(each, a "Control Agreement"), unless the Collateral Agent's security interest
in any such account is otherwise perfected; provided that until the US Airways
Loan has been paid in full, the Collateral Agent under the US Airways Loan
Agreement may also be a party thereto and have priority with respect to the
control of any such securities account or deposit account thereunder. In
furtherance thereof, with respect to any deposit account or securities account
listed on Schedule 5.13 in existence on the Effective Date, and thereafter prior
to establishing any other deposit account or securities account at any financial
institution (other than with respect to Excluded Cash), each Obligor shall enter
into a Control Agreement with such financial institution and the Collateral
Agent (subject to the proviso to the preceding sentence), except that the
Obligors shall not be obligated to enter into Control Agreements (or otherwise
provide for the perfection the Collateral Agent's security interest) with
respect to (i) payroll, trust, or fiduciary accounts, including the Trust
Accounts, (ii) zero balance cash management accounts through which disbursements
are made and settled on a daily basis with no balance remaining overnight, and
disbursement accounts for the clearing of drafts, holding only funds in respect
of drafts already made or issued, and (iii) deposit accounts and securities
accounts that have an average weekly aggregate balance of less than $2,000,000;
provided that the aggregate amount of all deposit accounts and securities
accounts not subject to Control Agreements (or otherwise perfected) in reliance
on clause (iii) above shall not, in the case of such accounts located outside
the United Sates,


                                       72

exceed $25,000,000 at any time in the aggregate, and in the case of all such
accounts (including accounts located outside the United Sates), exceed
$35,000,000 in the aggregate at any time.

          SECTION 5.14. LOWER-TIER COVERED TRANSACTION. If and for so long as
the Board is a guarantor of Tranche A or a Lender hereunder, in the event that
any Obligor enters into any "lower-tier covered transaction" (as such term is
defined in 31 C.F.R. Section 19.110, as amended or modified from time to time
and not excepted therefrom by 31 C.F.R. Section 19.200(c)) in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereunder, each Obligor will include the clause
entitled "Certificate Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and
Voluntary Exclusion - Lower Tier Covered Transactions" as set forth in Appendix
B to Part 19 of title 31 of the C.F.R. in such lower-tier covered transaction
and each Obligor will obtain a certification from the other Person or Persons
party to such lower-tier covered transaction to the effect that each such other
Person (and each "principal" thereof, as such term is defined in 31 C.F.R.
Section 19.105, as amended or modified from time to time) is not presently
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily
excluded from participation in such transaction by any Federal department or
agency, or an explanation why such Person is unable to so certify. Further, no
Obligor will enter into a lower-tier covered transaction with a Person who has
been proposed for debarment under 48 C.F.R. Section 9.4, debarred or suspended
unless granted an exception for such lower-tier covered transaction pursuant to
31 C.F.R. Section 19.215.

          SECTION 5.15. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. Each Obligor will perform,
observe or fulfill the obligations, covenants and conditions contained in each
of its Contractual Obligations, provided that a failure to so perform, observe
or fulfill such obligations, covenants and conditions that (i) could not (either
individually or in the aggregate) reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) does not preclude continued operations by the Obligors at
any of the airport terminals listed on Schedule 4.20 shall not constitute a
breach of this Section 5.15.

          SECTION 5.16. SLOT UTILIZATION. Each Obligor holding or operating
Slots shall utilize its Slots in a manner consistent with the Slot Regulations
so as to avoid the withdrawal of any Slot by the FAA or other revocation or
termination for failure to comply with the Slot Regulations, taking into account
any waivers or other relief granted by the FAA or otherwise under the Slot
Regulations; provided, however, that the Obligors shall not be required to so
utilize Secondary Slots to the extent the Obligors determine that such Secondary
Slots are no longer commercially required. The Obligors shall maintain
personnel, policies, procedures and a computer database for the monitoring,
utilization and management of the Slots in compliance with the Slot Regulations
so as to ensure, to the greatest extent operationally feasible, that no Slot
becomes subject to withdrawal by the FAA or is otherwise revoked or terminated
based upon the failure to comply with the Slot Regulations.

          SECTION 5.17. STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING. Group (a) will use reasonable
efforts to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange or another
national securities exchange or for quotation on a national automated
interdealer quotation system, and (b) after the effectiveness of such listing,
will comply in all material respects with all applicable corporate governance
listing standards of such national securities exchange or national automated
interdealer quotation system, including standards relating to the composition,
duties and responsibilities, and functioning of boards of directors and board
committees.

          SECTION 5.18. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Promptly upon the request of the
Board, any Counter-Guarantor or the Agent, each Obligor will, at its expense,
promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver such further documents and do such
other acts and things as the Board, such Counter-Guarantor, the Loan
Administrator or the Agent may reasonably request in order to effect fully the
purposes of the Loan Documents and to maintain and ensure the validity,
effectiveness, priority and perfection of the Collateral Agent's Liens pursuant
to the Collateral Documents.

the expense of the Borrower, credit and recovery ratings on the Loan from S&P or
Moody's, which ratings shall assess both (x) the risk of default and ultimate
recovery on the Loan and (y) the likely recovery or loss given a default on the
Loan (in each case, without regard to the Board Guaranty or any
Counter-Guaranty). The credit and recovery ratings shall be available to the
Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Loan Administrator, the Lenders and the Board.

provided that if an Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions involves or has a value in excess of $10,000,000, such Obligor
shall not enter into such Affiliate Transaction or series of Affiliate

Obligors and an Excluded Subsidiary (including the guaranty of obligations of
other Obligors, but not including the guaranty of obligations of Excluded
Subsidiaries) provided that such transactions are not otherwise prohibited by
this Agreement; (iii) reasonable and customary fees and compensation paid to,
and indemnity provided on behalf of, officers, directors and employees of any

Obligor or the senior management of the Borrower or Group in good faith; (iv)
any Restricted Payments permitted by Section 6.3; (v) transactions contemplated
by the Marketing and Service Agreements; (vi) transactions between any Obligor

employee groups of such Obligor provided such transactions are not otherwise
prohibited by this Agreement; (vii) the Loan Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby; and (viii) transactions expressly contemplated by the Plan
of Reorganization, without giving affect to any subsequent amendments to the

that, in the case of any sale, transfer or other disposition of assets or
property which are Collateral from one Obligor to another Obligor (or to an
Excluded Subsidiary), whether pursuant to this Section 6.7, Section 6.9 or
otherwise, the Lien of the Collateral Agent in such assets or property
immediately prior to such sale, transfer or other disposition shall continue and
survive such transaction and remain attached to (and perfected in) such assets
or property following such transaction, and each Obligor which takes title to
such assets or property acknowledges and agrees that such title is subject to
the Lien of the Collateral Agent.

          SECTION 6.8. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. From and after the date hereof, (a)
no Obligor shall engage in any principal line of business other than (i) the
businesses engaged in by the Obligors on the date hereof and related businesses

engage in any business other than the business engaged in by it on the Effective

          SECTION 6.9. MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION. No Obligor will consolidate with

assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, other than the Merger,
unless: (i) (a) in the case of a consolidation or merger involving the Borrower
or US Airways, the Borrower or US Airways (as applicable) is the surviving
entity or if the Borrower or US Airways (as applicable) is not the surviving
entity, such surviving entity or the Person that acquires by conveyance, lease
or transfer the properties and assets of the Borrower or US Airways (as
applicable) substantially as an entirety, shall be a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof or
the District of Columbia and can make the representations contained in Section
4.1(b), and shall expressly assume, by an agreement executed and delivered to
the Agent and the Board in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Agent and the Board, the Borrower's obligations to repay the Loan (in the case
of the Borrower) and all (other) obligations of the Borrower or US Airways (as
applicable) under the Loan Documents, or (b) in the case of a consolidation or
merger involving Group, Group is the surviving entity or if Group is not the

conveyance, lease or transfer the properties and assets of Group substantially
as an entirety, shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of
the United States of America or any State thereof or the District of Columbia,
and shall expressly assume, by an agreement executed and delivered to the Agent
and the Board, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and
the Board, all of Group's obligations under each Loan Document to which it is a
party; (ii) immediately before and after giving effect to such transaction, no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and

the case of Section 6.4(b), based on Consolidated EBITDAR for the four quarters
ended as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter); (iii) if Section
6.14(b) is applicable to such transaction, the Obligors shall comply therewith;
and (iv) the Borrower has delivered to the Agent an Officer's Certificate and an
opinion of counsel from counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, stating that such
consolidation, merger, conveyance, lease or transfer and such agreement comply
with this Section 6.9 and that all conditions precedent herein provided for
relating to such transaction have been complied with and addressing such other
matters as may be reasonably requested by the Board and the Agent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.9 but
subject to Section 6.14(a)(i) and (b) (in each case, if applicable), (A) any
Obligor may merge or consolidate with any other Obligor; provided that in the
case of each such merger or consolidation involving a Principal Obligor, if such
Principal Obligor shall not be the continuing or surviving Person, the surviving
Obligor shall comply with clauses (i)(a) or (i)(b) (as applicable) and (iii)


                                       80

          SECTION 6.10. LIMITATIONS ON AMENDMENTS.

          (a) No Obligor shall amend, waive or modify, nor shall it consent to
or request any amendment, waiver or modification, of any of the material terms,
conditions, representations and covenants contained in any Indebtedness for
borrowed money that (i) shortens the final maturity date of such Indebtedness
(without giving effect to any amendment, waiver or modification, the "Initial
Indebtedness") or (ii) requires the acceleration of the final scheduled maturity
date and/or any principal payments, including but not limited to scheduled
payments and mandatory prepayments, and/or increases the principal amount
payable on any date (including, without limitation, pursuant to mandatory
prepayments) prior to the dates of analogous payments of such Initial
Indebtedness; provided, however, that this Section 6.10(a) shall not prohibit
the incurrence of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, the repayment of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, or any amendment, waiver or modification of the
terms of the Indebtedness being refinanced necessary to effect such repayment.
No Obligor shall amend, waive or modify, nor shall it consent to or request any
amendment, waiver or modification, of the US Airways Loan Agreement unless such
amendment, waiver or modification is permitted by and in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement.

          (b) No Obligor will, nor will it permit any other Obligor to, amend,
adopt or terminate any Plan (i) unless such action could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) in any manner that could
reasonably be expected to give the PBGC a sound and just basis to commence
Proceedings against the Obligors on the basis that such action constitutes a
subsequent change in connection with the Obligor's termination or replacement of
the defined benefit Retirement Income Plan for Pilots of US Airways, Inc. with
the 2003 Pilots Defined Contribution Plan.

          (c) No Obligor shall amend, restate, supplement or modify (or consent
to or permit any amendment, restatement, supplement or modification of) its
Investment Guidelines without the prior written consent of the Controlling

not be deemed to prohibit the adoption of the Investment Guidelines by any
Obligor.

specific property encumbered to secure payment of particular Indebtedness or to
be sold pursuant to an executed agreement with respect to a permitted Asset Sale
(including sale-leaseback transactions not prohibited by this Agreement), (b)
restrictions by reason of customary provisions restricting pledges, Liens,
assignments, subletting or other transfers contained in leases, licenses and

Liens or the property or assets subject to such leases, licenses or similar
agreements, as the case may be), (c) negative pledges contained in the Airbus
Financings and the GE Financings (and any replacements or refinancings of any
thereof), and (d) permitted refinancings or replacements of Indebtedness

will it permit any other Obligor to, enter into any agreement prohibiting the
creation or assumption of any Lien to secure the Obligations upon any of its
properties or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired to the extent that
such properties or assets are required to be pledged to secure the Obligations.

          SECTION 6.12. SPECULATIVE TRANSACTIONS. No Obligor will, nor will it
permit any other Obligor to, become a general partner in any general or limited
partnership or joint venture engaged or involved in, nor will any Obligor engage

similar speculative transactions; provided, however, that the following
transactions shall


                                       81

<PAGE>

not be prohibited by this Section 6.12: (i) transactions designed to hedge
against fluctuations in fuel costs, entered into in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past business practice or then current industry
practice, and not entered into for speculative purposes, (ii) transactions
designed to hedge interest rates entered into with respect to notional amounts
not to exceed actual or anticipated Indebtedness and not entered into for
speculative purposes and (iii) transactions designed to hedge against risks
associated with fluctuations in currencies entered into in the ordinary course
of business.

          SECTION 6.13. ASSET SALES. No Obligor will, nor will it permit any
other Obligor to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Sale unless (i)
the consideration received in respect of such Asset Sale is at least equal to
the Fair Market Value of the assets subject to such Asset Sale and (ii) at least
85% of the value of the consideration received by such Obligor in respect of
such Asset Sale (net of the amount of any Indebtedness secured by the assets
sold in such Asset Sale which is assumed by the purchaser thereof) is in the
form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that without the prior written
consent of the Controlling Creditor, the Obligors shall not consummate any Asset
Sales if and to the extent that the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds from all such
Asset Sales would exceed $10,000,000 per Fiscal Year, other than (x) Designated
Asset Sales and (y) sale-leasebacks not prohibited by Section 6.6 (subject to
compliance with Section 2.5(d), if applicable).

          SECTION 6.14. SPARE PARTS.

          (a) No Obligor shall (i) sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of
its spare parts which are Collateral to another Obligor if such other Obligor
has pledged spare parts which are not Collateral to secure any other
Indebtedness or obligation, other than in the ordinary course of business as
though between unaffiliated air carriers (including pursuant to interchange,
pooling, exchange and other similar arrangements customary in the airline
industry and consistent with Section 3.4(f) of the Aircraft Mortgages (as
defined in clause (ii) of the definition of Collateral Documents) or (ii)
commingle at any location its spare parts which are Collateral with the spare
parts of another Obligor if such other Obligor has pledged spare parts which are
not Collateral to secure any other Indebtedness or obligation, unless the
ownership of each such commingled spare part can be definitively determined at
all times by reference to the Obligors' spare parts tracking numbers and system;
provided that spare parts that are segregated on a separate shelf or in a
separate storage bin or other storage unit shall not be considered as having
been commingled even though such spare parts are present at the same location so
long the Obligors install signs on each such shelf, bin or other storage unit
containing Collateral bearing the inscription: "Property of US Airways, Inc. (or
other applicable Obligor), Mortgaged to Wilmington Trust Company, as Collateral
Agent" (such sign to be replaced if there is a successor Collateral Agent).

          (b) No Obligor who has pledged spare parts as Collateral will
consolidate or merge with, or convey, lease or transfer its properties and
assets substantially as an entirety to, or liquidate into, or otherwise combine
with, any other Obligor if such other Obligor has pledged spare parts which are
not Collateral to secure any other Indebtedness or obligation, unless (i)
following such transaction the Lien of the Collateral Agent in such spare parts
Collateral will remain perfected with the same priority as existed immediately
prior to such transaction, (ii) the surviving Obligor has established adequate
tracking and other systems to ensure that the spare parts which are Collateral
are not commingled with the surviving Obligor's other spare parts which are not
Collateral, (iii) at all times following such transaction the surviving Obligor
will be required to maintain spare parts subject to the Lien of the Collateral
Agent having an aggregate Appraised Value of at least 75% of the Appraised Value
of the spare parts Collateral set forth in the Baseline Appraisal, (iv) the
Obligors have provided thirty (30) days' prior written notice of such
transaction to the Agent, Collateral Agent, Loan Administrator and the Board
describing in reasonable detail the actions the Obligors will take to ensure
compliance with clauses (i) and (ii) above, and (v) no later than thirty (30)
days following the consummation of such transaction, Group has provided


                                       82

<PAGE>

an Officer's Certificate to the Agent (with a copy to the Collateral Agent, Loan
Administrator and the Board) certifying that such transaction complies with this
Section 6.14(b).

          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), the Borrower
may, on behalf of the other Obligors, from time to time propose amendments to
this Section 6.14 designed to both adequately protect the Collateral Agent's
interest in the spare parts Collateral and, to the extent consistent therewith,
maximize the Obligors' operational flexibility, and the Obligors, the Agent, and
the Board (so long as the Board is either a guarantor of Tranche A or a Lender
hereunder) shall have the ability by written consent to adopt any such proposal
and amend this Agreement to reflect the same without the consent of any other
Person, without regard to the provisions of Section 9.1(a).

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

          SECTION 7.1. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. Each of the following events shall
constitute an "Event of Default":

          (a) (i) failure by the Borrower to pay any installment of principal of
the Loan when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory
prepayment or otherwise or (ii) failure by the Borrower to pay any interest on
the Loan or any fee or any other amount due under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document within five (5) Business Days after the date due; or

          (b) any Obligor (i) fails to make when due (after giving effect to
applicable cure or grace periods, and whether as primary obligor or as guarantor
or other surety) payments in respect of rents, principal, interest or premium or
other payments, if any, under or in respect of one or more Capital Leases or
other Indebtedness or Operating Leases (other than Indebtedness referred to in
clause (a) of this Section 7.1) and the aggregate amount of all payment defaults
(after giving effect to applicable cure or grace periods) then existing in
respect of Indebtedness and aggregate amounts under Operating Leases shall equal
or exceed $25,000,000 (for clarification it shall be an Event of Default if the
applicable Obligor fails to pay when due the payment to General Electric Capital
Corporation or its applicable Affiliate referred to in Section 6.3(c)) or (ii)
fails to duly observe, perform or comply with any agreement with any Person or
any term or condition of any instrument, if such failure, either individually or
in the aggregate, shall have (A) resulted in the acceleration of, or entitles
any Person to accelerate, the payment of Indebtedness owed by such Obligor
which, together with all other accelerated Indebtedness and Indebtedness that is
entitled to be accelerated, has a principal amount that equals or exceeds
$25,000,000, (B) given rise under one or more Operating Leases to obligations
by, or rights of any other Person(s) to require, an Obligor to make payments

remaining basic rent payments (as determined in accordance with the formulas for
calculating "net present value" under the applicable leases or for leases
without such formulas, in accordance with formulas under leases for comparable
terms and comparable amounts) equals or exceeds $25,000,000; provided that the
failure by an Obligor to make one or more payments that are attributable to and
relate solely to return conditions under aircraft leases shall not constitute an
Event of Default under this Section 7.1(b) so long as the Obligor is, in good
faith, disputing the amount of such payments; or

          (c) failure by an Obligor to perform or comply with any term or
condition contained in Section 5.2, Section 5.10 or Article VI of this Agreement
(other than Section 6.4);

          (d) any representation, warranty, certification or other statement
made by any Obligor in any Loan Document or in any statement or certificate at
any time given by any Obligor in writing pursuant hereto or thereto or in
connection herewith or therewith shall be false in any material respect on the
date as of which made; or

          (e) any default by any Obligor in the performance of or compliance
with any provision contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents required to be performed or complied with by it (other than any such
provision referred to in any other clause of this Section 7.1), and (i) with
respect to a default under Section 6.4(a), such default shall not have been
waived within two (2) Business Days after the date of such default and (ii) with
respect to any other default, such default shall not have been remedied or
waived within thirty (30) days after the earliest of (A) a Responsible Officer
of a Principal Obligor obtaining knowledge of such default (which, in the case
of Section 6.4(b), will be presumed to have occurred no later than the date of
the delivery of financial statements pursuant to Section 5.1 for the end of the
accounting period as of which such default exists) or (B) receipt by the
Borrower of notice from the Agent or the Board of such default; or

          (f) (i) a court shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of
any Obligor in an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
any other relief described in clause (ii) below or other similar relief shall be
granted under any applicable federal or state law; or (ii) an involuntary case
shall be commenced against any Obligor seeking (A) relief under the Bankruptcy

Effect shall have been entered against one or more Obligors and shall remain
undischarged or unstayed, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, for a
period in excess of sixty (60) days; or

force and effect or the Board shall assert that any of its obligations

<PAGE>

writing, repudiate such Counter-Guarantee or deny that its obligations
thereunder are valid, binding and enforceable; or

          (k) Any Counter-Guarantor Letter of Credit shall for any reason cease
to be in full force and effect other than in accordance with its express terms
and the terms of the related Counter-Guarantee or the issuer of such

and except in the case of clause (i)(A) of this subsection (m), such default
shall continue unremedied for a period of ten (10) days; or

          (n) any of the insurance coverages required to be maintained by the

          (o) any Obligor shall fail generally, or shall admit in writing its
inability, to pay its debts as such debts become due; or

          (p) (i) Slots, other than Secondary Slots which the Obligors have

result of failure to comply with the Slot Regulations and (y) the aggregate
Appraised Value of such Slots (in each case, as of the date of such withdrawal,
revocation or termination) shall have exceeded $10,000,000; or (ii) any Obligor
implements a cessation, cancellation or curtailment of flight operations or a
change in flight schedules which, assuming no subsequent further action (such as
the sale, lease or trade of the affected Slots or their allocation to new or
additional flights) is taken, could reasonably be expected to result in the
withdrawal by the FAA or other revocation or termination based upon failure to
comply with the Slot Regulations of Slots, other than Secondary Slots, the
aggregate Appraised Value of which (as of the date of such cessation,
cancellation or curtailment) exceeds $10,000,000; it being understood, however,
that an Event of Default shall not have occurred under this clause (ii) if the
Slots otherwise affected are sold, leased or traded in arm's length transactions
or allocated to new or additional flights prior to the implementation of such
cessation, cancellation or curtailment of flight operations or change in flight
schedules; or

          (q) any default by any Obligor in the performance of or compliance
with Section 5.14 of this Agreement and such default shall not have been
remedied or waived within 180 days after the earlier of (i) a Responsible
Officer of Group or the Borrower obtaining knowledge of such default or (ii)
receipt by the Borrower of notice from the Agent or the Board of such default.

          SECTION 7.2. REMEDIES. During the continuance of any Event of Default,
the Agent shall, solely at the request of the Controlling Creditor by notice to
the Borrower (with a copy to the Board and the Loan Administrator), declare that
the Loan, all interest thereon and all other amounts and Obligations payable
under this Agreement to be immediately due and payable, whereupon the Loan, all


                                       85

<PAGE>

such interest and all such amounts and Obligations shall become and be
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower;
provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in
clause (f) or (g) of Section 7.1, the Loan, all such interest and all such
amounts and Obligations shall automatically become and be immediately due and
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower. Remedies exercisable by the
Agent or the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any Collateral Document shall
be exercised solely upon instructions received by the Agent or the Collateral
Agent from the Controlling Creditor in writing.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                       THE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

          The parties hereto agree as follows:

          SECTION 8.1. AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION. Each Lender and the Board
hereby appoints and authorizes each of the Agent and the Collateral Agent to
take such action as administrative agent and collateral agent, respectively, on
its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents as are delegated by such Lender to it as Agent or Collateral Agent by
the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto, and each of the Agent and the Collateral Agent hereby
accepts such authorization and appointment. The Agent and the Collateral Agent
shall be obligated to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or any other
Loan Document against the Agent or the Collateral Agent. Except with respect to
any matter as to which the Agent or the Collateral Agent is expressly directed
to take any specific action (or refrain from taking any specific action) by the
terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, neither the Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall be required to take any action (including making any
determination) or refrain from taking any action except upon the written
instructions of the Controlling Creditor, and neither the Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall be required to exercise any discretion vested in the
Agent or the Collateral Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
but each of the Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be required to act or to
refrain from acting with regard to any such action (and shall be fully protected
in, and shall have no liability for, so acting or refraining from action) upon
such written instructions of the Controlling Creditor (including, without
limitation, with respect to matters arising under the Collateral Documents and
the other Loan Documents), and such instructions shall be binding upon all
Lenders and the Board; provided, however, that neither the Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall be required to take any action which could reasonably be
expected to expose either the Agent or the Collateral Agent to liability or
which is contrary to this Agreement, the Board Guaranty, any Counter-Guarantee,
any Counter-Guarantor Letter of Credit, the Notes any other Loan Document or
applicable law. As to any provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document under which action may be taken or approval given by less than all of
the Lenders or the Board or both, as the case may be, the action taken or
approval given by the required Lenders or the Board or both, as the case may be,
shall be binding upon all Lenders and the Board to the same extent and with the
same effect as if each Lender and the Board had joined therein. Each of the
Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any note, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, teletype message, facsimile
transmission, statement, order or other document, instrument or writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or
persons and, in respect of legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected
by the Agent or the Collateral Agent. Each of the Agent and the Collateral Agent
may deem and treat the payee of the Notes as the owner thereof for all purposes
hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the Agent and the Collateral Agent. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person who at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent is the holder of the Loan shall


                                       86

<PAGE>

be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of
the Loan. Upon any delivery of any instructions to the Collateral Agent by the
Requisite Lenders pursuant to this Agreement, the Agent shall certify to the
Collateral Agent that the Lenders delivering such instructions constitute the
Requisite Lenders under the Agreement and (i) the Collateral Agent may but shall
be under no obligation to follow such instructions until the Agent shall certify
to the Collateral Agent that the Lenders delivering such instructions constitute
the Requisite Lenders under the Agreement and (ii) the Collateral Agent shall be
fully protected in, and shall have no liability for, following such instructions
whether or not the Agent shall have made the certification referred to in clause
(i) above or declining to follow such instructions until the Agent shall have
made the certification referred to in clause (i) above. Each Lender and the
Board hereby authorizes and directs the Collateral Agent to enter into the
Collateral Documents on its behalf, and acknowledges and agrees to all of the
terms and conditions thereof and agrees to be bound thereby. No provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be deemed to impose any duty or
obligation on the Collateral Agent to perform any act or acts or exercise any
right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it in any jurisdiction
in which it shall be illegal or in which the Collateral Agent shall be
unqualified or incompetent to perform any such act or acts or to exercise any
such right, power, duty or obligation or if such performance or exercise would
constitute doing business by the Collateral Agent in such jurisdiction or impose
a tax on the Collateral Agent by reason thereof or to risk its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties
hereunder.

          SECTION 8.2. RELIANCE, ETC. Neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent
nor any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable to any Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Board for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it or by such directors, officers, agents
or employees under or in connection with this Agreement, the Notes or any other
Loan Document, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct as actually and finally determined by a final, non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and only to the extent of direct
(as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive) damages. Without
limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each of the Agent and the
Collateral Agent: (i) may consult with legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable to any
Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Board for any action taken or omitted to
be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such experts; (ii)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender, the Loan Administrator or,
except, with respect to the Agent as expressly provided in the Board Guaranty,
the Board, and shall not be responsible to any Lender, the Loan Administrator
or, except, with respect to the Agent as expressly provided in the Board
Guaranty, the Board, for any statements, warranties or representations (whether
oral or written) made in or in connection with this Agreement, the Notes or any
other Loan Document; (iii) shall not have any duty, and shall incur no liability
for its failure, to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance
of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, the Notes or any
other Loan Document on the part of any Obligor or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of any Obligor; (iv) shall not be responsible
to any Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Board for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties in this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan
Document, or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto, or for
the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the liens or security
interests in any of the Collateral created or intended to be created by any Loan
Document, or for the validity or sufficiency of the Collateral or any Loan
Document, or for insuring the Collateral or for any payment of taxes, charges,
assessments, or liens upon the Collateral or otherwise as to the maintenance of
the Collateral, for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan
Document, or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (v)
shall incur no liability under or in respect to this Agreement, the Notes or any
other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other
instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, facsimile transmission, cable
or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or
parties; and (vi) may deem and treat each Lender which makes a loan hereunder as
the holder of the indebtedness resulting therefrom for all purposes hereof until
the Agent receives and accepts an


                                       87

<PAGE>

Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such Lender, as assignor, and an
eligible assignee as provided in Section 9.2. The Collateral Agent shall be
under no obligation or duty to take any action under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or otherwise if taking such action (i) would subject the
Collateral Agent to a tax in any jurisdiction where it is not then subject to a
tax or (ii) would require the Collateral Agent to qualify to do business in any
jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, unless in each such case the
Collateral Agent shall receive security, or indemnity satisfactory to it against
such tax and any liability resulting from such qualification, in each case as
results from the taking of such action under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document. The Collateral Agent may execute any of the trusts or powers hereof
and perform any duty hereunder, or under any other Loan Document, either
directly or by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact. The Collateral Agent
shall be entitled to the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such trusts, powers and duties and shall not be liable to any Lender, the Loan
Administrator or the Board for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel. The Collateral Agent
shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it without gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Collateral Agent shall not be liable for interest on any money or assets
received by it except as the Collateral Agent may agree in writing. Assets held
by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement or any Collateral Document
need not be segregated from other assets except to the extent expressly required
hereunder or thereunder or required by law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (i) if any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document provides that the Collateral Agent
shall act at the direction of the Agent, the Collateral Agent shall be fully
protected in, and shall have no liability for, taking any action pursuant to
such direction, and (ii) if the Collateral Agent shall request instructions from
the Controlling Creditor with respect any act or action (including the failure
to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such
action unless and until the Collateral Agent shall have received written
instructions from the Controlling Creditor and the Collateral Agent shall not
incur any liability to any Person by reason of so refraining and shall be fully
protected in following any such written instructions. Whenever in the
administration of this Agreement or any other Collateral Document, the
Collateral Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that a factual matter be
proved or established in connection with the Collateral Agent taking, suffering
or omitting any action hereunder or thereunder, such matter (unless other
evidence in respect thereof is specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be
conclusively proved and established by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of
the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), the Agent or the Controlling Creditor
delivered to the Collateral Agent, and such certificate shall be full warrant to
the Collateral Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted in reliance
thereon and the Collateral Agent shall be fully protected in connection
therewith and shall have no liability therefor.

          SECTION 8.3. AFFILIATES. If and so long as the Agent or the Collateral
Agent shall remain a Lender, the Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable,
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender
and may exercise the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent or the
Collateral Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated, include the Agent and the Collateral Agent, each in its
individual capacity. Unrelated to its role as Agent or Collateral Agent as set
forth herein, the Agent and the Collateral Agent and their respective Affiliates
may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and
generally engage in any kind of business with, any Obligor and any Person who
may do business with or own securities of any Obligor, all as if it were not the
Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder and without any duty to
account therefor to the Lenders.

          SECTION 8.4. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE LENDERS AND THE BOARD. Each
Lender, the Loan Administrator and the Board's representatives have actively
engaged in the negotiation of all of the terms of this Agreement. The Board's
representatives have met with the Obligors to discuss the business,


                                       88

<PAGE>

affairs, financial condition and prospects of the Obligors. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, neither
the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, to provide any Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Board with any
credit or other information with respect to the Borrower whether coming into its
possession as of the date of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, or to
notify any Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Board of any Default or Event
of Default except as provided in Section 8.5. This Agreement and all instruments
or documents delivered in connection with this Agreement have been reviewed and
approved by each Lender, the Loan Administrator and the Board and none of the
Lenders, the Loan Administrator or the Board has relied on the Agent or the
Collateral Agent as to any legal or factual matter in connection therewith or in
connection with the transactions contemplated thereunder.

          SECTION 8.5. EVENTS OF DEFAULT; TERMINATION OF BOARD GUARANTY.

          (a) In the event of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,
any Lender, any Counter-Guarantor or the Board knowing of such event may (but
shall have no duty to), or any Principal Obligor pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(vi)
hereof shall, give the Agent and the Collateral Agent written notice specifying
such Default or Event of Default and expressly stating that such notice is a
"notice of default". Neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be deemed
to have knowledge of such events unless the Agent or the Collateral Agent, as
applicable, has received such notice or, with respect to the Agent only, unless
the Default or Event of Default consists of a failure of payment of principal or
interest on the Loan. In the event that the Agent or the Collateral Agent
receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, the
Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall give written notice thereof
to the Lenders, the Counter-Guarantors, the Board and the Loan Administrator. In
the event that such notice is a notice of an Event of Default or such Default
matures into an Event of Default, the Agent and the Collateral Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
directed in writing by the Controlling Creditor, as provided in Section 7.2;
provided, however, that, unless and until the Agent or the Collateral Agent
shall have received such directions, the Agent and the Collateral Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable and
in the best interest of the Lenders and the Board.

          (b) In the event the Agent or the Collateral Agent shall receive
written notice from the Board to the effect that (i) the Board has the right to
terminate the Board Guaranty under Sections 2.04 and 2.05 thereof, (ii) any
portion of the Board Guaranty has terminated under Section 2.03 thereof or
otherwise or (iii) the Board Guaranty shall for any reason have ceased to be in
full force and effect or the Board shall have asserted that any of its
obligations thereunder is invalid or unenforceable, the Agent or the Collateral
Agent, as applicable shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Lenders
and the Counter-Guarantors. Neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be
deemed to have knowledge of any such event unless the Agent or the Collateral
Agent, as applicable, has received such notice (except with respect to the Agent
if any such event results from the failure of the Agent to perform any of its
obligations under the Board Guaranty).

          SECTION 8.6. AGENT'S AND COLLATERAL AGENT'S RIGHT TO INDEMNITY. The
Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder on behalf of any Lender or the Board unless it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by such Lender or the Board, as
the case may be, against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred
by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

          SECTION 8.7. INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT. The
Lenders hereby agree to indemnify the Agent and the Collateral Agent and all of
their respective affiliates, directors,


                                       89

<PAGE>

officers, employees, advisors and representatives thereof (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably as most recently in effect prior to the
date indemnification is sought, from and against any and all costs, losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses which may be incurred by or asserted or
awarded against the Agent or the Collateral Agent in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement and/or the other Loan Documents or any action
taken or omitted by the Agent or the Collateral Agent under this Agreement
and/or the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that no Lender shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from the Agent's or the Collateral Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct as actually and finally determined by a final, non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and only to the extent of direct
(as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive) damages. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent and the
Collateral Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Agent
or the Collateral Agent in connection with the administration or enforcement of,
or the preservation of any rights under, this Agreement (including this Section
8.7) and/or the other Loan Documents, to the extent that the Agent or the
Collateral Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. The
agreements in this Section 8.7 shall survive the termination of the other
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the resignation or
removal of the Collateral Agent hereunder.

          SECTION 8.8. SUCCESSOR AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT. Each of the Agent
and the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to the Lenders, the Board, the Counter-Guarantors, the Loan Administrator and
the Borrower and may be removed at any time with cause by the Controlling
Creditor and, so long as the Board is a guarantor of Tranche A or a Lender
hereunder, with or without cause by the Board. Any such resignation or removal
shall be effective upon appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent or
Collateral Agent, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 8.8. Upon any
such resignation or removal, the Borrower shall have the right to appoint a
successor agent, subject to confirmation by the Controlling Creditor. If no
successor agent shall have been appointed and accepted such appointment within
sixty (60) days after the retiring Agent's or Collateral Agent's, as applicable,
giving of notice of resignation or the Controlling Creditor's removal of the
Agent or the Collateral Agent, the Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable,
may, with the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) of the Controlling
Creditor and, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Borrower, appoint a successor Agent or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, who shall be willing to accept such appointment. Each successor
agent appointed hereunder shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of
the United States of America or of any State thereof and shall have a combined
capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor Agent or
Collateral Agent, such successor Agent or the Collateral Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring or removed Agent or Collateral Agent, and the retiring or
removed Agent or Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations as agent under this Agreement. After any Agent's or Collateral
Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent or Collateral
Agent under this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.9. RELEASE OF LIENS ON COLLATERAL AND SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS.
The Lenders and the Board irrevocably authorize and instruct the Collateral
Agent to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral
Agent under any Collateral Document and to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from
its obligations under the Second Lien Guaranty and the other Loan Documents to
which such Subsidiary may be a party (i) upon payment in full of all Obligations
(other than contingent indemnification obligations), (ii) upon the transfer of
property as part of or in connection with any Asset Sale that complies with
Section 6.13 and with respect to which the relevant Obligor complies with
Section 2.5(d), as applicable, (iii) upon the pledge, sale, transfer or other
disposition of property as part of


                                       90

<PAGE>

or in connection with any Replacement Secured Financing with respect to which
the relevant Obligor complies with Section 2.5(b), (iv) to the extent release of
any Lien is otherwise permitted under this Agreement or any Collateral Document
(including, without limitation, in the proviso to Section 5.8(b) hereof), or (v)
subject to Section 9.1, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the
Controlling Creditor; provided, that the Collateral Agent shall not be obligated
to release any Lien pursuant to this Section 8.9 until its receipt from the
Borrower of an Officer's Certificate certifying that such release complies with
this Section 8.9, and upon receipt of such Officer's Certificate the Collateral
Agent shall release such Lien in accordance with such Officer's Certificate and
shall be fully protected in connection therewith. The Borrower shall send a copy
of any such Officer's Certificate to the Agent, the Board and the Loan
Administrator at the same time that it sends such Officer's Certificate to the
Collateral Agent.

          SECTION 8.10. CO-COLLATERAL AGENT; SEPARATE COLLATERAL AGENT.

          (a) If at any time or times it shall be necessary or prudent in order
to conform to any law of any jurisdiction in which any of the Collateral shall
be located, or to avoid any violation of law or imposition on the Collateral
Agent of taxes by such jurisdiction not otherwise imposed on the Collateral
Agent, or the Collateral Agent shall be advised by legal counsel that it is
necessary or prudent in the interest of the Lenders, or the Collateral Agent
shall deem it desirable for its own protection in the performance of its duties
hereunder, the Collateral Agent and the Borrower shall promptly execute and
deliver all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to constitute another
bank or trust company, or one or more persons approved by the Collateral Agent
and the Borrower (with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of the
Controlling Creditor), either to act as Collateral Agent or co-Collateral Agents
of all or any of the Collateral under this Agreement, jointly with the
Collateral Agent originally named herein or therein or any successor Collateral
Agent, or to act as separate Collateral Agent or Collateral Agents of any of the
Collateral.

          (b) Every separate Collateral Agent and every co-Collateral Agent,
other than any successor Collateral Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8.8,
shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act and be such, subject
to the following provisions and conditions:

          (i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred upon such
     Collateral Agent in respect of the custody, control and management of
     moneys, papers or securities shall be exercised by such Collateral Agent or
     any agent appointed by such Collateral Agent;

          (ii) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed
     upon the Collateral Agent hereunder shall be conferred or imposed and
     exercised or performed by the Collateral Agent and such separate Collateral
     Agent or separate Collateral Agents or co-Collateral Agent or co-Collateral
     Agents, jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such
     separate Collateral Agent or separate Collateral Agents or co-Collateral
     Agent or co-Collateral Agents, except to the extent that under any law of
     any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed
     the Collateral Agent shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such
     act or acts, or unless the performance of such act or acts would result in
     the imposition of any tax on the Collateral Agent which would not be
     imposed absent such joint act or acts, in which event such rights, powers,
     duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such separate
     Collateral Agent or separate Collateral Agents or co-Collateral Agent or
     co-Collateral Agents;

          (iii) except as provided in clause (ii) above, no power given hereby
     to, or which it is provided herein or therein may be exercised by, any such
     co-Collateral Agent or co-Collateral Agents or separate Collateral Agent or
     separate Collateral Agents shall be exercised hereunder or thereunder by
     such co-Collateral Agent or co-Collateral Agents or separate Collateral
     Agent or


                                       91

     separate Collateral Agents except jointly with, or with the consent in
     writing of, the Collateral Agent, anything contained herein to the contrary
     notwithstanding;

          (iv) no Collateral Agent hereunder shall be personally liable by
     reason of any act or omission of any other Collateral Agent hereunder; and

          (v) the Borrower and the Collateral Agent, at any time by an
     instrument in writing executed by them jointly (with the consent, not to be
     unreasonably withheld, of the Controlling Creditor), may accept the
     resignation of or remove (for any reason or no reason at all) any such
     separate Collateral Agent or co-Collateral Agent and, in that case by an
     instrument in writing executed by them jointly, may appoint a successor to
     such separate Collateral Agent or co-Collateral Agent, as the case may be,
     anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

          SECTION 8.11. COLLATERAL AGENTS' LIEN. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, as security for the
payment of its fee under Section 2.7(f) and all other amounts payable to the
Collateral Agent hereunder including, without limitation, any and all expenses
and any amounts for which the Collateral Agent is entitled to reimbursement or
indemnification, (i) the Collateral Agent is hereby granted a lien on all
Collateral and (ii) the Collateral Agent shall have the right to use and apply
any of the funds held by the Collateral Agent to cover all such fees and other
amounts.

then any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that:

          (i) no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall, unless in

          except as provided herein; and

               (8) modify the application of payments to the Loan under Section

     (C) waiver, amendment or modification of the Intercreditor Agreement in a
     manner adverse to the Second Lien Claimholders (under and as defined
     therein), in each case shall be effective unless in writing and signed by
     (I) the Initial Lender, so long as it continues to hold Tranche B-4, (II)
     each Counter-Guarantor so long as it is either a guarantor of Tranche B-1,
     Tranche B-2 or Tranche B-3, respectively, or a Lender hereunder, and (IV)

     Agent or the Loan Administrator, as the case may be, under this Agreement,
     the other Loan Documents, any Counter-Guarantee or the Board Guaranty.

          (b) Execution of Amendments and Waivers by the Agent. The Agent may,
but shall have no obligation to, with the written concurrence of any Lender,
execute amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of that Lender.
Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on the
Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice
or demand in similar or other circumstances.

          (c) Non-Consenting Lenders. In connection with any proposed amendment,
modification, waiver or termination requiring the consent of all affected
Lenders, if the consent of Requisite Lenders is obtained, but the consent of
other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such Lender whose
consent is not obtained as described in this Section 9.1 being referred to as a
"Non-Consenting Lender"), then, so long as the Lender that is acting as the
Agent is not a Non-Consenting Lender, at the Borrower's request, the Agent or an
Eligible Lender that is acceptable to the Agent, the Board and, so long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower, shall have
the right with the Agent's consent and in the Agent's sole discretion (but shall
have no obligation) to purchase from such Non-Consenting Lender, and such
Non-Consenting Lender agrees that it shall, upon the Agent's request, sell and
assign to the Lender that is acting as the Agent or such Eligible Lender, all of
the portion of the Loan of such Non-Consenting Lender for an amount equal to the
principal balance of such portion of the Loan held by the Non-Consenting Lender
and all accrued interest


                                       93

<PAGE>

and fees with respect thereto through the date of sale, such purchase and sale
to be consummated pursuant to an executed Assignment and Acceptance.

          SECTION 9.2. ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS; SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

          (a) Assignment. Each Lender may sell, transfer, negotiate or assign

          (b) Deliveries in Connection with Assignment. The parties to each
assignment under this Section 9.2 shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for
its acceptance and recording, an Assignment and Acceptance, and the assignee, if

have the rights and obligations of a Lender and (ii) the assignor thereunder
shall, to the extent that rights and obligations under this Agreement have been
assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights

Documents, other than those relating to events or circumstances occurring prior
to such assignment (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations
under the Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

          (c) Agent's Duties Upon Assignment. Upon its receipt of an Assignment
and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the Agent shall,

                                       94

<PAGE>

contained therein in the Register, (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the

the prior consent of the Borrower, the Agent or the Board as collateral or
otherwise, any of its rights under this Agreement to any Federal Reserve Bank

no such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder.

          (e) Participations. Each Lender may, without the prior consent of the
Borrower or any other Person, sell participations, to the extent permitted by
the Regulations, in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations
hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan Documents (any such purchaser
of a participation being referred to as a "Participant"); provided that (i)
neither the Notes nor the Board Guaranty nor any applicable Counter-Guarantee is
assigned, conveyed, sold or transferred in whole or in part, (ii) in the case of
an assignment of Tranche A, the Board's ability to assert any and all defenses
available to it under the Board Guaranty and the law is not adversely affected,
and in the case of an assignment of Tranche B (other than Tranche B-4), the
applicable Counter-Guarantor's ability to assert any and all defenses available
to it under the applicable Counter-Guarantee and the law is not adversely
affected, (iii) the Borrower will not be obligated to pay any greater amount
under Section 2.9(c) or Section 2.11 (in respect of increased costs, Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes) to the Participant than the Borrower is then obligated to
pay to the selling Lender under such Sections, (iv) any such participation with
respect to Tranche B-1, Tranche B-2 or Tranche B-3 shall be subject to the
applicable provisions of any applicable Counter-Guarantee, (v) no Participant
shall, without the consent of the Borrower (such consent to be in the Borrower's
sole discretion), be a (x) Prohibited Transferee, (y) an Affiliate of a
Prohibited Transferee or (z) a maintenance provider for aircraft airframes,
engines or related parts or a manufacturer of engines or of parts related to
airframes or engines, and (vi) no Participant shall be a manufacturer of
aircraft airframes. In the event of the sale of any participation by any Lender,
(A) such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged,
(B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties for the
performance of such obligations, (C) such Lender shall remain the holder of such
Obligations for all purposes of this Agreement, (D) the Borrower, the Agent, the
Board, the applicable Counter-Guarantor (as applicable) and the other Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (E) each
Participant, shall deliver to the Borrower, the Agent and each Counter-Guarantor
(if such participation is of Tranche B), on or prior to the date of the sale of
the participation, two completed copies of IRS Form W-9, W-8BEN or W-8ECI or
other applicable form, certificate or document required to satisfy the
requirements of Section 2.11. Any Participant will be entitled to the benefits
of Section 2.9(c), Section 2.9(e), Section 2.10 and Section 2.11 to the same
extent as if such Person were a Lender.

          (f) Assignment of Tranche A at the Direction of the Board. The Tranche
A Lender agrees that if and to the extent that the Board Guaranty remains in
effect, the Board shall have the right, upon ten (10) Business Days' prior
notice to the Tranche A Lender (with a copy to the Agent and the Borrower) to
require the Tranche A Lender to sell, transfer and assign Tranche A, in whole or
in part (but in no event in excess of the amount then guaranteed under the Board
Guaranty), and with or without the benefit of the Board Guaranty (which, if
without, shall be fully and irrevocably released upon the closing and to the
extent of such purchase), to a Person designated by the Board, for a purchase
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such portion of Tranche A to be
sold, transferred and assigned, together with all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon through the date of purchase (which purchase price may include a payment
under the Board Guaranty) and payment of any losses, expenses and liabilities
under Section 2.9(e) hereof attributable to such sale, transfer and assignment
(it being acknowledged and agreed


                                       95

<PAGE>

that any premium paid by such purchaser for such portion of the Loan shall be
for the benefit of the Board); provided, that the Tranche A Lender (to the
extent commercially reasonable) and the Borrower shall cooperate with the Board
to minimize any such losses, expenses and liabilities so long as any such action
would not result in the Tranche A Lender incurring any additional costs or
otherwise be disadvantageous to the Tranche A Lender in its sole judgment; and
provided, further that the Tranche A Lender shall also be entitled to payment of
all other unpaid Obligations owing to it through the date of purchase from the
Obligors, including, without limitation, fees, expenses, indemnities and other
amounts which are then due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Documents, which amounts the Obligors agree to pay to the Tranche A Lender on
the date of purchase. The closing of the Tranche A assignment shall be
consummated pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance and such other
documentation as the Tranche A Lender, the Board and such assignee shall
mutually agree is reasonably necessary. Any such sale, transfer or assignment
under this subsection (f) shall be subject to the conditions specified in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (vi) of the proviso in subsection (a) of this
Section 9.2.

          (g) Assignment of Tranche B at the Direction of a Counter-Guarantor.
Each of the Tranche B-1 Lender, Tranche B-2 Lender and Tranche B-3 Lender agrees
that if and to the extent that the applicable Counter-Guarantee is and remains
in effect, the applicable Counter-Guarantor shall have the right, upon ten (10)
Business Days' prior notice to such Tranche B-1 Lender, Tranche B-2 Lender and
Tranche B-3 Lender, as the case may be (with a copy to the Agent and the
Borrower), to require such Tranche B Lender to sell, transfer and assign such
portion of Tranche B-1, Tranche B-2 and Tranche B-3 (as the case may be), in
whole or in part (but in no event in excess of the amount then guaranteed under
the applicable Counter-Guarantee), and with or without the benefit of the
applicable Counter-Guarantee (which, if without, shall be fully and irrevocably
released upon the closing and to the extent of such purchase), to a Person
designated by such Counter-Guarantor, for a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such portion of Tranche B-1, Tranche B-2 and Tranche B-3 (as
the case may be) to be sold, transferred and assigned, together with all accrued
and unpaid interest thereon through the date of purchase (which purchase price
may include a payment under the applicable Counter-Guarantee) and payment of any
losses, expenses and liabilities under Section 2.9(e) hereof attributable to
such sale, transfer and assignment (it being acknowledged and agreed that any
premium paid by such purchaser for such portion of the Loan shall be for the
benefit of the applicable Counter-Guarantor); provided, that such the Tranche B
Lender (to the extent commercially reasonable) and the Borrower shall cooperate
with the applicable Counter-Guarantor to minimize any such losses, expenses and
liabilities so long as any such action would not result in the Tranche B Lender
incurring any additional costs or otherwise be disadvantageous to such Tranche B
Lender in its sole judgment; and provided, further that the Tranche B-1 Lender,
Tranche B-2 Lender and Tranche B-3 Lender shall also be entitled to payment of
all other unpaid Obligations owing to it through the date of purchase from the
Obligors, including, without limitation, fees, expenses, indemnities and other
amounts which are then due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Documents, which amounts the Obligors agree to pay to such Tranche B Lender on
the date of purchase. The closing of the Tranche B-1, Tranche B-2 or Tranche B-3
assignment shall be consummated pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance and
such other documentation as the Tranche B-1 Lender, Tranche B-2 Lender or
Tranche B-3 Lender (as the case may be) and such assignee shall mutually agree
is reasonably necessary. Any such sale, transfer or assignment under this
subsection (f) shall be subject to the conditions specified in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (vi) of the proviso in subsection (a) of this Section 9.2.

          (h) Reimbursement of Fees upon Certain Assignments. If during any
Interest Period some or all of the Loan is assigned in compliance with this
Section 9.2 and as a result of such assignment the Applicable Interest Rate on
the portion of the Loan so assigned will accrue at the rate specified in the
proviso of the definition of "Applicable Interest Rate," then the Board (in the
case of an assignment of Tranche A), the applicable Counter-Guarantor (in the
case of an assignment of Tranche B-1, Tranche B-2 or Tranche B-3) or the Initial
Lender (in the case of an assignment of Tranche B-4) shall reimburse the


                                       96

<PAGE>

Borrower on or prior to the first day of the next Interest Period for a pro rata
amount of the Guarantee Fee, Counter-Guarantee Fee or Supplemental Facility Fee,
as the case may be, paid by the Borrower to the Board, such Counter-Guarantor or
the Initial Lender for such Interest Period, which amount shall be equal to the
product of (x) the amount of the Guarantee Fee, Counter-Guarantee Fee or
Supplemental Facility Fee attributable to the portion of the Loan so assigned
and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such
Interest Period during which the assignee held such assigned portion of the Loan
and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Interest
Period.

          (i) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, provided that except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
no Obligor may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Board, the Lenders and the
Agent (and any attempted assignment or transfer by an Obligor without such
consent shall be null and void).

          SECTION 9.3. COSTS AND EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consummated, the Obligors agree to pay promptly (i)
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Loan Administrator, the Board,
the Initial Lender, each Counter-Guarantor, the Agent and the Collateral Agent
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of the
Loan Documents, the Board Guaranty and all documents relating thereto (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses), (ii) all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Loan Administrator, the Board, the Lenders, the
Counter-Guarantors, any Participant, the Agent and the Collateral Agent in
connection with any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications hereto
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) and (iii) all costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Lenders, each Counter-Guarantor, any Participant, the Loan
Administrator and the Board in enforcing any Obligations of, or in collecting
any payments due from, the Obligors hereunder or under the other Loan Documents,
including any such costs and expenses incurred after the filing of a bankruptcy
or insolvency proceeding with respect to any Obligor.

          SECTION 9.4. INDEMNITIES. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be consummated, the Obligors agree to defend, indemnify, pay and
hold harmless the Board, the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the
Counter-Guarantors, the Lenders, the Loan Administrator and their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (collectively
called the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses
and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including without limitation
the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for such Indemnitees, but
excluding Taxes), whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on
any federal, state or foreign laws, statutes, rules or regulations (including
without limitation securities and commercial laws, statutes and rules or
regulations), on common law or equitable cause or on contract or otherwise, that
may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such Indemnitee, in any
manner arising out of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any
Counter-Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including,
without limitation, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan) or any
breach or default by the Obligors of any provision of the Loan Documents
(collectively called the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that the Obligors
shall not have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise (i)
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee (as actually
and finally determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction) and only to the extent that such Indemnified Liabilities
constitute direct (as opposed to special, indirect, punitive or consequential)
damages or (ii) constitute ordinary and usual operating or overhead expenses of
an Indemnitee (excluding, without limitation, costs and expenses of any outside
counsel, consultant or agent). To the extent that the undertaking to defend,
indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, each of the
Obligors


                                       97

<PAGE>

shall contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy
under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified
Liabilities incurred by the Indemnitees or any of them. No Indemnitee shall have
any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to
any Obligor or any of its security holders or creditors for or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such liability
is determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from such Indemnitee's gross negligence
or willful misconduct. In no event, however, shall any Indemnitee be liable on
any theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages (including, without limitation, any loss of profits, business or
anticipated savings). Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing,
each Indemnitee (i) may consult with legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable to any
Obligor or any of its security holders or creditors for any action taken or
omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such
experts and (ii) shall incur no liability under or in respect to this Agreement,
the Notes or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent,
certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, facsimile
transmission, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by
the proper party or parties. The agreements in this Section 9.4 shall survive
the termination of the other provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and, in the case of the Collateral Agent, shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent hereunder.

          SECTION 9.5. RIGHT OF SET-OFF. In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Lender is hereby authorized by the
Obligors at any time or from time to time, with notice to the Obligors and to
each other Lender, the Board, the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Loan
Administrator, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits
(general or special, including, but not limited to, Indebtedness evidenced by
certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured) and any other
Indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender to or for the credit or
the account of any Obligor against and on account of the obligations and
liabilities of such Obligor to that Lender under this Agreement, the Second Lien
Guaranty, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, including, but not limited to,
all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this
Agreement, the Second Lien Guaranty, the Notes, or any other Loan Document,
irrespective of whether or not (i) that Lender shall have made any demand
hereunder or (ii) the principal of or the interest on the Loan or any other
amounts due hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant to Section 7.2
and although said obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent
or unmatured.

          SECTION 9.6. SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC. The Lenders and the Board
hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall, whether by voluntary
payment, by realization upon security, through the exercise of any right of
set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement
of any right under the Loan Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of
a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment
or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest,
fees and other amounts then due and owing to the Lenders and the Board hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "Aggregate Amounts Due")
which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender or the Board
in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender or the Board, then
the Lender or the Board receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (i)
notify the Agent and each other Lender and the Board of the receipt of such
payment and (ii) (A) in the case of a Lender, (1) apply a portion of such
payment to purchase participations equal to the portion of the Aggregate Amounts
Due to the other Lenders and (2) pay to the Board the portion of the Aggregate
Amounts Due to it or (B) in the case of the Board, pay to each Lender the
portion of the Aggregate Amounts Due to it (which participations shall be deemed
to have been purchased and payments made simultaneously upon the receipt by the
seller or the Board of its portion of such payment, and which participations
will be permitted notwithstanding any prohibition) to


                                       98

<PAGE>

the contrary in Section 9.2(e)) so that all such recoveries of Aggregate Amounts
Due shall be shared by all Lenders and the Board in proportion to the Aggregate
Amounts Due to them, provided that if all or part of such proportionately
greater payment received by such purchasing Lender or the Board is thereafter
recovered from such Lender or the Board upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of
the Borrower or otherwise, those purchases or other payments shall be rescinded
and the purchase prices paid for such participations or other payments shall be
returned to such purchasing Lender or the Board ratably to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing
arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased may
exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with
respect to any and all monies owing by the Borrower to that holder with respect
thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation
held by that holder.

          SECTION 9.7. NOTICES, ETC. Unless otherwise specifically provided
herein, any notice, request or other communication herein required or permitted
to be given shall be in writing and may be personally served or sent by
telefacsimile or courier service and shall be deemed to have been given when
delivered in person or by courier service, or upon receipt of telefacsimile
(promptly confirmed in writing). For the purposes hereof, the address of each
party hereto and each Counter-Guarantor shall be as set forth under such party's
name on Annex A or such other address as shall be designated by such party in a
written notice delivered to the Agent. A copy of any and all notices, requests,
communications, demands, reports, documents or other materials (including,
without limitation, any of the materials delivered by the Obligors under Section
5.1(b)) delivered or sent by any party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall also be given to the Loan Administrator. Anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, the Obligors shall not be required to provide
the Board with any notices or certificates required to be delivered to the Board
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents if, at the time such notice is
required to be delivered, the Board is neither a guarantor of Tranche A nor a
Lender hereunder.

          SECTION 9.8. NO WAIVER; REMEDIES. No failure on the part of the Board,
any Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 9.9. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (AND, TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE, THE BANKRUPTCY CODE); PROVIDED THAT THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF
THE BOARD HEREUNDER (WHETHER AS GUARANTOR OR LENDER) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE FEDERAL LAW OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
IF AND TO THE EXTENT SUCH FEDERAL LAW IS APPLICABLE, AND OTHERWISE IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

          SECTION 9.10. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS.

          (a) Submission to Jurisdiction. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT, EACH OBLIGOR HEREBY AGREES THAT ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST IT
IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS
PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID
COURTS. THE PARTIES


                                       99

<PAGE>

HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE
LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH ANY OF
THEM MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING
IN SUCH RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS.

          (b) Service of Process. EACH OF THE OBLIGORS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL LEGAL PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICES AND
DOCUMENTS IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENTS BY THE MAILING (BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID)
OR DELIVERING OF A COPY OF SUCH PROCESS TO IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS
OF SECTION 9.7.

          (c) No Limitation. Nothing contained in this Section 9.10 shall affect
the right of the Agent or any Lender or other party hereto to serve process in
any other manner permitted by law or commence legal proceedings or otherwise
proceed against any Obligor in any other jurisdiction.

          SECTION 9.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OBLIGOR IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT.

          SECTION 9.12. MARSHALING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. Neither the Agent nor
any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any
Obligor or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the
Obligations. To the extent that any Obligor makes a payment or payments to the
Agent for the account of the Board, the Loan Administrator, any Lender or any
Counter-Guarantor (each, a "Payee") or any Payee receives payment from exercise
of their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such
setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party, then (i) to the extent of such recovery, the
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all rights
and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not
occurred and (ii) each Payee shall pay and return such amount to the Agent as
the Agent may be required to disgorge or otherwise pay to a trustee, receiver or
any other party in respect of the portion of the payment from such Obligor
distributed by the Agent to such Payee hereunder.

          SECTION 9.13. SECTION TITLES. The Section titles and subtitles
contained in this Agreement are and shall be without substantive meaning or
content of any kind whatsoever and are not a part of the agreement between the
parties hereto.

          SECTION 9.14. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached
to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are attached to the same
document. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile
transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all parties
shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Agent.

          SECTION 9.15. SEVERABILITY. In case any provision in or obligation
under this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any


                                       100

jurisdiction the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

          SECTION 9.16. CONFIDENTIALITY.

          (a) Each party hereto (other than the Board) and each
Counter-Guarantor shall, and shall procure that its respective officers,
employees and agents shall, keep confidential and shall not, without the prior
written consent of the other parties, disclose to any third party this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the information, reports or
documents supplied by or on behalf of such other party not otherwise publicly
available, except that a party shall be entitled to disclose this Agreement, any
other Loan Document, and any such information, reports or documents:

          (i) in connection with any proceeding arising out of or in connection
     with this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, the Board Guaranty or
     any Counter-Guarantee to the extent that such party may reasonably consider
     necessary to protect its interest;

          (ii) to any potential assignee or transferee of any party's rights
     under this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or any
     Counter-Guarantor's rights under its Counter-Guarantee or any other person
     proposing to enter into contractual arrangements with any party in relation
     to this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, the Board Guaranty or
     any Counter-Guarantee subject to the relevant party obtaining an
     undertaking from such potential assignee or transferee or other person in
     corresponding terms to this Section 9.16;

          (iii) pursuant to any applicable laws, ordinances, judgments, decrees,
     injunctions, writs, rules, regulations, orders, interpretations, licenses,

     agency or authority in any relevant jurisdiction;

participation under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

          SECTION 9.17. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. Each Counter-Guarantor shall be
an express third party beneficiary of this Agreement to the extent the
provisions of this Agreement by their terms confer upon such Counter-Guarantor
any right or remedy and shall be entitled to rely on each representation and
warranty of the Borrower hereunder as fully and with the same force and effect
as if made expressly to such Counter-Guarantor, and the execution and delivery
of its Counter-Guarantee to the Agent shall constitute such Counter-Guarantor's
agreement to the provisions of Section 9.16 and further agreement to be bound by
the terms and conditions hereof applicable to the Counter-Guarantors (including,
without limitation, Section 2.4, Section 2.7, Section 2.8, Section 9.12, Section
9.16, Section 9.18 and Section 9.22 hereof) in asserting any right or remedy
hereunder.

          SECTION 9.18. ACKNOWLEDGMENT REGARDING FEDERAL AUTHORITY.

          (a) Each of the parties hereto and each Counter-Guarantor acknowledges
and agrees that:

          (i) the operations and assets of the Obligors (including, without
     limitation, Aircraft Related Equipment and other assets that constitute
     Collateral) are subject, directly and indirectly, to the actions, inaction
     and policies of various Governmental Authorities, including, in particular
     but without limitation, the United States Department of Transportation (of
     which the FAA is a component) and the United States Department of Justice;

          (ii) Governmental Authorities, in discharging their current and future
     statutory or regulatory responsibilities, may act, decline to act, or adopt
     policies resulting in material adverse effects on (A) the business,
     condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, prospects,
     assets or properties of the Obligors, (B) the ability of the Obligors to
     perform their payment or other material obligations under the Loan
     Documents, and (C) the value of the Collateral or the practical ability of
     the Collateral Agent to realize such value in the event of a Default or an
     Event of Default;

          (iii) no Governmental Authority, in discharging its statutory or
     regulatory responsibilities, has or shall have any obligation whatsoever to
     the Obligors, or to any secured party by reason of such Governmental
     Authority's representation on the Board, the Board's issuance of the Board
     Guaranty, or the Board's participation as a party to the other Loan
     Documents, to consider the potential that any of the material adverse
     effects referred to in clause (ii) above may result from such Governmental
     Authority's discharge of its statutory or regulatory responsibilities; and

          (iv) neither the Board, in discharging its rights and
     responsibilities, or in exercising its discretion, under the Act, the
     Regulations, the Board Guaranty or the other Loan Documents, nor any of the
     Board's members, acting in their capacities as such, has or shall have any
     obligation whatsoever to the Obligors or to any of the secured parties to
     take any action in connection with a Governmental Authority's discharge of
     its statutory or regulatory responsibilities which may have any of the
     material adverse effects referred to in clause (ii) above, and the Board
     may not take any action depriving a Governmental Authority of its rights
     and powers to discharge its statutory and regulatory responsibilities in
     any manner that may have any of the material adverse effects referred to in
     clause (ii) above.

          (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the Department of Transportation, through the
FAA, has broad authority under Title 49 of the United States Code to regulate
the use of the navigable airspace of the United States so as to ensure its safe
and efficient utilization, (ii) the exercise of such authority may substantially
impair or eliminate altogether the utility to the Obligors and value to the
secured parties of Aircraft Related Equipment pledged as Collateral and other
assets of the Obligors such as Gate Leases and Slots utilized at airports, (iii)
nothing in this Agreement or in the Slot Security Agreement (as defined in
clause (iii) of the definition of "Collateral Documents") shall be construed or
asserted by any of the parties to impede or interfere with the FAA's exercise of
its authority under the Slot Regulations, and (iv) no assurance, express or
implied, has been given by any Governmental Authority, including the Board, to
the Obligors or to any secured party, nor has any of the Obligors or any secured
party relied upon any such assurance, with respect to any future action,
inaction or policy of the FAA or any other Governmental Authority relating to
any such Collateral or other assets.

          SECTION 9.19. INDEPENDENCE OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
COVENANTS. All representations and warranties made in and covenants under this
Agreement shall be given independent effect so that (a) if a particular
representation and warranty is unqualified, the fact that another representation
and warranty is qualified shall not affect the operation of the former
provision; and (b) if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any
of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or
would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid
the occurrence of an Event of Default or Default if such action is taken or
condition exists.

          SECTION 9.20. ACKNOWLEDGMENT REGARDING SECOND LIEN. Each of the
Lenders, the Counter-Guarantors and the Board (i) acknowledges and agrees that

Documents are junior and subordinate to the Liens for the benefit of the First
Lien Claimholders in such Collateral to the extent provided in the Intercreditor
Agreement, (ii) agrees and consents to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement

Counter-Guarantor's Counter-Guarantee remains in full force and effect and is
hereby ratified and confirmed.

contemplated by the "Original MOU" as defined therein, as such GE Merger MOU and
Original MOU have been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified to the date
hereof, regardless of whether such transactions occur on, before or after the

     it has made such analysis and decision independently and without reliance

     relinquish its rights (except those which survive the payment in full of
     the Obligations) other than those relating to events or circumstances
     occurring prior to the Effective Date and be released from its obligations
     under the Loan Documents.

          (vi) Upon such acceptance and recording by the Agent, from and after
     the Effective Date, the Agent shall make all payments under the Loan
     Documents in respect of the interest assigned hereby (i) to or for the
