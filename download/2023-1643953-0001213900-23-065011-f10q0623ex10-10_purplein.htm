SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender
will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&rsquo;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with <U>Section 2.02</U> (or, in the case of a Borrowing
of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by <U>Section
2.02)</U> and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a
Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender
and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately
available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to
but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base
Rate Loans. If the Borrowers and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping
period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrowers the amount of such interest paid by the Borrowers for such
period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall
constitute such Lender&rsquo;s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrowers shall be without prejudice to any claim
the Borrowers may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.</P>

the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in

amount due. With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes to any Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Swing Line
Lender or any other Secured Party as to which the Administrative Agent determines (in its sole and absolute discretion) that any of the
following applies (such payment referred to as the &ldquo;<U>Rescindable Amount</U>&rdquo;): (1) the Borrowers have not in fact made the
corresponding payment to the Administrative Agent; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount(s) received
by it from Borrowers either individually or in the aggregate (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason
otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Secured Parties severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Secured Party, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank

respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount
equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by any Loan Party under this

Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest
paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), <U>provided</U> that each Loan Party, upon the request of
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to any Loan Party (plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or
the Letter of Credit Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Letter of Credit Issuer is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender
or the Letter of Credit Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems
confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.</P>

Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted

Base Rate Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended, and (b) the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such
illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of &ldquo;Base Rate&rdquo;, in
each case until each affected Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such
determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower Agent shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality,

(the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without
reference to clause (c) of the definition of &ldquo;Base Rate&rdquo;), on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if all affected
Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain
such SOFR Loans to such day. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid
or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to <U>Section 3.05.</U></P>

of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and
obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees
payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent&rsquo;s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, the provisions of this Article and <U>Section 11.04</U> shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative
Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while
the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as the Administrative Agent.</P>

such compliance occurs.</P>

the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any
other similar applicable state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Each of the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent

on such Person to the same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Communication entered into by Electronic Signature, will
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person enforceable against such Person in accordance with the terms thereof

acceptance of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or
an electronically signed Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. The Administrative

the foregoing, (a) to the extent the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender has agreed to accept such

given by or on behalf of any Loan Party and/or any Lender without further verification and (b) upon the request of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.</P>

Obligation or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, &ldquo;<U>QFC Credit Support</U>&rdquo;, and each such QFC,

Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the &ldquo;<U>U.S. Special Resolution Regimes</U>&rdquo;) in respect of such

were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood
and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered
