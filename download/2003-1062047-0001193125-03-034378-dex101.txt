                           SECTION 5B. LESSOR ADVANCE.

     5B.1. Procedure for Lessor Advance.
           ----------------------------

           Upon receipt from Lessee by the Agent of a Requisition pursuant to
     Section 4.2, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
     Lessor shall make an Advance under the Lessor Commitment equal to six
     percent (6%) of the amount requested in such Requisition on the applicable
     Closing Date. The Lessor Advance shall be based on the Eurodollar Rate or
     the ABR, as designated by the Lessee in the Requisition.

     5B.2. Lessor Yield.
           ------------

           (a)  The Lessor Advance shall bear yield calculated at the rate of
     Lessor Yield applicable from time to time. The Lessee shall pay as Basic
     Rent to the Agent for distribution to the Lessor the Lessor Yield in
     arrears on each Scheduled Interest Payment Date or as otherwise provided
     herein.

           (b)  If all or a portion of Lessor Yield shall not be received
     by the Lessor (or the Agent on behalf of the Lessor) when due (whether at
     the stated maturity, by

                                       10

<PAGE>

     acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall, without limiting the
     rights of the Lessor hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement, bear
     interest at the Lessor Overdue Rate, in each case from the date of
     nonpayment until paid (whether after or before judgment) and shall be paid
     upon demand. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event
     of Default, Lessor Yield shall be calculated at the Lessor Overdue Rate.

     5B.3. Scheduled Return of Lessor Advance.
           ----------------------------------

           The outstanding amount of the Lessor Advance shall be due in full on
     the Expiration Date. On the Expiration Date, subject to the terms of this
     Agreement, the Lessor (or the Agent on behalf of the Lessor) shall receive
     from the Lessee as Basic Rent under the Lease the outstanding amount of the
     Lessor Advance then due, together with all accrued but unpaid Lessor Yield
     and all other amounts due to Lessor under the Operative Agreements.

     5B.4. Early Return of Lessor Advance.

           (a)  Subject to Section 5B.4(a) or (b) and Sections 11.2(e), 11.3 and
     11.4 of this Agreement, the Lessor Advance may at any time after the first
     annual anniversary of the Closing Date and from time to time thereafter be
     prepaid by the Lessee as a payment of Supplemental Rent, in whole or in
     part, without premium or penalty, upon at least three (3) Business Days'
     irrevocable notice to the Agent, specifying the date and amount of
     prepayment of the Lessor Advance. Upon receipt of such notice, the Agent
     shall promptly notify the Lessor thereof. If such notice is given, the
     amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
     specified therein. Amounts prepaid shall not be re-advanced.

           (b)  If on any date the Agent or the Lessor shall receive any payment
     in respect of (i) any Casualty, Condemnation or Environmental Violation
     pursuant to Sections 15.1(a) or 15.1(g) or Article XVI of the Lease
     (excluding any payments in respect thereof which are payable to Lessee in
     accordance with the Lease), or (ii) the Termination Value of the Property
     in connection with the delivery of a Termination Notice pursuant to Article
     XVI of the Lease, or (iii) the Termination Value of the Property or such
     other applicable amount in connection with the exercise of a Purchase
     Option under Article XX of the Lease or the exercise of the option of the
     Lessor to transfer the Property to the Lessee pursuant to Section 20.3 of
     the Lease, then in each case, the Agent or the Lessor shall receive such
     payment to be distributed, subject to the requirements of Section 8.7, in a
     manner as the Financing Parties shall from time to time agree.

           (c)  Each prepayment of the Lessor Advances pursuant to Section
     5B.4(a) shall be allocated to reduce the Lessor Property Cost of the
     Property immediately before giving effect to such prepayment.

           (d)  The Lessee shall not be permitted to prepay the Lessor Advance
     in accordance with Section 5B.4(d) unless, concurrently with such
     prepayment, Lessee (with a payment of Supplemental Rent) shall also cause
     (i) each of the Credit Notes to be

                                       11

<PAGE>

     prepaid and (ii) each of the Mortgage Loans to be prepaid, in each case
     (including the payment to Lessor of all or a portion of the Lessor Advance)
     ratably based on such Primary Financing Party's share of the Financing then
     outstanding.

     5B.5. Conversion and Continuation Options.
           -----------------------------------

           (a)  The Lessee may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar
     Lessor Advances to ABR Lessor Advances by giving the Lessor at least three
     (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election, provided,
     that any such conversion may only be made on the last day of an Interest
     Period with respect thereto, and provided, further, to the extent an Event
     of Default has occurred and is continuing on the last day of any such
     Interest Period, the applicable Eurodollar Lessor Advances shall
     automatically be converted to ABR Lessor Advances. The Lessee may elect
     from time to time to convert ABR Lessor Advances to Eurodollar Lessor
     Advances by giving the Lessor at least three (3) Business Days' prior
     irrevocable notice of such election. All or any part of outstanding Lessor
     Advance may be converted as provided herein, provided, that (i) no ABR
     Lessor Advance may be converted into a Eurodollar Lessor Advance after the
     date that is one (1) month prior to the Expiration Date and (ii) such
     notice of conversion regarding any Eurodollar Lessor Advance shall contain
     an election by the Lessee of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Lessor
     Advance to be created by such conversion and such Interest Period shall be
     in accordance with the terms of the definition of the term "Interest
     Period" including without limitation subparagraphs (A) through (D) thereof.

           (b)  Each Eurodollar Lessor Advance shall automatically be continued
     as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with
     respect thereto for an Interest Period of equal duration to the immediately
     preceding Interest Period, provided, that no Eurodollar Lessor Advance may
     be continued as such after the date that is one (1) month prior to the
     Expiration Date, provided, further, no Eurodollar Lessor Advance may be
     continued as such if a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing as of the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar
     Lessor Advance, and provided, further, if any continuation is not permitted
     pursuant to the preceding provisos, such Eurodollar Lessor Advance shall
     automatically be converted to an ABR Lessor Advance on the last day of such
     then expiring Interest Period.

     5B.6. Computation of Lessor Yield.
           ---------------------------

           (a)  Lessor Yield shall be calculated on the basis of a year of three
     hundred sixty (360) days for the actual days elapsed. Any change in the
     Lessor Yield resulting from a change in the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage
     shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which
     such change becomes effective.

           (b)  Pursuant to Section 12.12 of this Agreement, the calculation of
     Lessor Yield under this Section 5B.6 shall be made by the Agent. Each
     determination of Lessor Yield by the Agent shall be conclusive and binding
     in the absence of manifest error.

           (c)  If the Eurodollar Rate cannot be determined by the Agent in the
     manner specified in the definition of the term "Eurodollar Rate", then
     commencing on the Scheduled Interest Payment Date next occurring and
     continuing until such time as the

                                       12

<PAGE>

     Eurodollar Rate can be determined by the Agent in the manner specified in
     the definition of such term, the outstanding Lessor Advance shall bear a
     yield based on the ABR.

           result in a Material Adverse Effect;

           (cc) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
     that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which
     liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
     result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
     benefit obligations under each funded Plan (based on the assumptions used
     for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did

     material Subsidiaries of the Lessee on the date hereof, setting forth their
     respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their
     respective ownership interest held by the Lessee or other Subsidiaries. All
     of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of such material
     Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and
     non-assessable.

           (ee) None of the transactions contemplated under the Operative
     Agreements as they relate to, nor the use of the proceeds from the issuance
     and sale of the Notes by, Lessee, will violate the Trading with the Enemy
     Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets control regulations of the
     United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as
     amended) or any enabling legislation or executive order relating thereto.
     Without limiting the foregoing, (a) neither the Lessee nor any of its
     Subsidiaries (i) is a blocked person described in Section 1 of Executive
     Order 13224 of September 23, 2001 Blocking Property and Prohibiting
     Transaction With Persons Who Commit and Threaten to Commit, or Support
     Terrorism (66 Fed. Reg. 49049 (2001)) or (ii) engages in any dealings or
     transactions, or is otherwise associated, with any such blocked person and
     (b) the Lessee and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, in all material
     respects, with the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (signed into law October 26,
     2001).

                              SECTION 6B. GUARANTY

     6B.1. Guaranty of Payment and Performance.
           -----------------------------------

     Subject to Section 6B.7, each Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally,
absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each Financing Party
the prompt payment and performance of the Company Obligations in full when due
(whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or
otherwise) or when such is otherwise to be performed; provided, notwithstanding
the foregoing, the obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 6B shall not
constitute a direct guaranty of the indebtedness of the Borrower evidenced by
the Notes

                                       21

<PAGE>

but rather a guaranty of the Company Obligations arising under the
Operative Agreements. This Section 6B is a guaranty of payment and performance
and not of collection and is a continuing guaranty and shall apply to all
Company Obligations whenever arising. All rights granted to the Financing
Parties under this Section 6B shall be subject to the provisions of Section
8.2(d) and 8.6.

     6B.2. Obligations Unconditional.
           -------------------------

     Each Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder are
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity,
regularity or enforceability of any of the Operative Agreements, or any other
agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any substitution, release or
exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Company
Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety, guarantor or
co-obligor, it being the intent of this Section 6B.2 that the obligations of the
Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that this Section 6B may be enforced by the
Financing Parties without the necessity at any time of resorting to or
exhausting any other security or collateral and without the necessity at any
time of having recourse to the Notes or any other of the Operative Agreements or
any collateral, if any, hereafter securing the Company Obligations or otherwise
and each Guarantor hereby waives the right to require the Financing Parties to
proceed against the Lessee or any other Person (including without limitation a
co-guarantor) or to require the Financing Parties to pursue any other remedy or
enforce any other right. Each Guarantor further agrees that it hereby waives any
and all right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against
the Lessee or any other Guarantor of the Company Obligations for amounts paid
under this Section 6B until such time as the Credit Notes, the Mortgage Notes,
the Lessor Advance, accrued but unpaid interest, accrued but unpaid Lessor Yield
and all other amounts owing under the Operative Agreements have been paid in
full. Without limiting the generality of the waiver provisions of this Section
6B, each Guarantor hereby waives any rights to require the Financing Parties to
proceed against the Lessee or any co-guarantor or to require Lessor to pursue
any other remedy or enforce any other right, including without limitation, any
and all rights under N.C. Gen. Stat. Section 26-7 through 26-9. Each Guarantor
further agrees that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Financing Parties
from suing on any Operative Agreement or foreclosing any security interest in or
Lien on any collateral, if any, securing the Company Obligations or from
exercising any other rights available to it under any Operative Agreement, or
any other instrument of security, if any, and the exercise of any of the
aforesaid rights and the completion of any foreclosure proceedings shall not
constitute a discharge of any Guarantor's obligations hereunder; it being the
purpose and intent of each Guarantor that its obligations hereunder shall be
absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances;
provided that any amounts due under this Section 6B which are paid to or for the
benefit of any Financing Party shall reduce the Company Obligations by a
corresponding amount (unless required to be rescinded at a later date). Neither
any Guarantor's obligations under this Section 6B nor any remedy for the
enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed or released in any
manner whatsoever by an impairment, modification, change, release or limitation
of the liability of the Lessee or by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of
the Lessee. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension or accrual of any of the Company Obligations and notice of or proof of
reliance by any Financing Party upon this Section 6B or acceptance of this
Section 6B. The Company Obligations shall conclusively be deemed to have been
created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in
reliance upon this Section 6B. All dealings between the Lessee and any of the
Guarantors, on the one hand,

                                       22

<PAGE>

and the Financing Parties, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively
presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Section 6B.

     6B.3. Modifications.
           -------------

     Each Guarantor agrees that (a) all or any part of the security now or
hereafter held for the Company Obligations, if any, may be exchanged,
compromised or surrendered from time to time; (b) no Financing Party shall have
any obligation to protect, perfect, secure or insure any such security
interests, liens or encumbrances now or hereafter held, if any, for the Company
Obligations or the properties subject thereto; (c) the time or place of payment
of the Company Obligations may be changed or extended, in whole or in part, to a
time certain or otherwise, and may be renewed or accelerated, in whole or in
part; (d) the Lessee and any other party liable for payment under the Operative
Agreements may be granted indulgences generally; (e) any of the provisions of
the Notes or any of the other Operative Agreements may be modified, amended or
waived; (f) any party (including any co-guarantor) liable for the payment
thereof may be granted indulgences or be released; and (g) any deposit balance
for the credit of the Lessee or any other party liable for the payment of the
Company Obligations or liable upon any security therefor may be released, in
whole or in part, at, before or after the stated, extended or accelerated
maturity of the Company Obligations, all without notice to or further assent by
such Guarantor, which shall remain bound thereon, notwithstanding any such
exchange, compromise, surrender, extension, renewal, acceleration, modification,
indulgence or release.

     6B.4. Waiver of Rights.
           ----------------

     Each Guarantor expressly waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law: (a) notice of acceptance of this Section 6B by any Financing
Party and of all extensions of credit or other Advances by the Lessor and the
Credit Note Purchasers pursuant to the terms of the Operative Agreements; (b)
presentment and demand for payment or performance of any of the Company
Obligations; (c) protest and notice of dishonor or of default with respect to
the Company Obligations or with respect to any security therefor; (d) notice of
any Financing Party obtaining, amending, substituting for, releasing, waiving or
modifying any security interest, lien or encumbrance, if any, hereafter securing
the Company Obligations, or any Financing Party's subordinating, compromising,
discharging or releasing such security interests, liens or encumbrances, if any;
and (e) all other notices to which such Guarantor might otherwise be entitled.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Guarantor's payments
hereunder shall be due ten (10) Business Days after written demand by the Agent
for such payment (unless the Company Obligations are automatically accelerated
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Operative Agreements in which case
the Guarantors' payments shall be automatically due).

     6B.5. Reinstatement.
           -------------

     The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 6B shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Company Obligations is rescinded or
must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Company Obligations,
whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or
otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify each Financing Party
on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by any Financing Party in connection with
such rescission or restoration, including without

                                       23

<PAGE>

limitation any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim
alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or
similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

     6B.6. Remedies.
           --------

     The Guarantors agree that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and
each Financing Party, on the other hand, the Company Obligations may be declared
to be forthwith due and payable as provided in the applicable provisions of the
Operative Agreements (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and
payable in the circumstances provided therein) notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing such
Company Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any
other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or such Company
Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such
Company Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall
forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Operative Agreements.

     6B.7. Limitation of Guaranty.
           ----------------------

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any of
the other Operative Agreements, to the extent the obligations of any Guarantor
shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including
without limitation because of any applicable state or federal law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under
applicable law (whether federal or state and including without limitation the
Bankruptcy Code).

     Subject to Section 6B.5, upon the satisfaction of the Company Obligations
in full, regardless of the source of payment, the Guarantors' obligations
hereunder shall be deemed satisfied, discharged and terminated other than
indemnifications set forth herein that expressly survive.

     6B.8. Contribution.
           ------------

     To the extent of any payments made under this Section 6B, each Guarantor
making such payment shall have a right of contribution from the other
Guarantors, but such Guarantor covenants and agrees that such right of
contribution shall be subordinate in right of payment to the rights of the
Financing Parties for which full payment has not been made or provided for and,
to that end, such Guarantor agrees not to claim or enforce any such right of
contribution unless and until all of the Credit Notes, the Mortgage Notes, the
Lessor Advance, accrued but unpaid interest, accrued but unpaid Lessor Yield and
all other amounts owing under the Operative Agreements have been irrevocably
paid and discharged.

     6B.9. Payment of Amounts to the Agent.
           -------------------------------

     Each Financing Party hereby instructs each Guarantor, and each Guarantor
hereby acknowledges and agrees, that until such time as the Credit Notes, the
Mortgage Notes and the Lessor Advance are paid in full and the Liens evidenced
by the Security Agreement and the Mortgage Instruments have been released any
and all Rent (excluding Excepted Payments which shall be payable to each Person
as appropriate) and any and all other amounts of any kind or type

                                       24

<PAGE>

 under any of the Operative Agreements due and owing or payable to any
Person shall instead be paid directly to the Agent (excluding Excepted Payments
which shall be payable to each Person as appropriate) or as the Agent may direct
from time to time for allocation and distribution in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 8.7 hereof.

     6B.10. Release of Guarantors.
            ---------------------

     Each Financing Party hereby agrees that (a) the Agent shall be permitted to
release any Guarantor from its guaranty obligations under this Section 6B
without the consent of any other Financing Party if the release is granted in
connection with a disposition by the applicable Credit Party of all the shares
of stock or partnership or other equity interest in such Guarantor and such
disposition is permitted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Operative
Agreements and (b) the Agent shall be permitted to release any Guarantor from
its guaranty obligations under this Section 6B.9 without the consent of any
other Financing Party if the release is requested by the Lessee in connection
with a dissolution of the Guarantor, subject to the Lessee providing to the
Agent written representations to the effect that such Guarantor has no business
operations and no assets.

                     SECTION 7. PAYMENT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES.

     7.1.  Transaction Expenses.
           --------------------

     The Lessor agrees on the Closing Date, to pay, or cause to be paid, all
Transaction Expenses arising from the transactions consummated on the Closing

timely pay all amounts referred to in this Section 7.1 to the extent not paid on
the Closing Date from the Note Proceeds, the Mortgage Loans and the Lessor
Advance.

     7.2.  Brokers' Fees.
           -------------

     The Lessee agrees to pay or cause to be paid any and all brokers' fees, if
any, including without limitation any interest and penalties thereon, which are
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Operative Agreements, excluding the fees of any brokers retained by
the Agent, the Lessor, any other Primary Financing Party, or any Affiliate of
any of the foregoing.

and/or replacements are ultimately entered into, or giving or withholding of
waivers of consents hereto or thereto, which have been requested by the Lessee,
the Agent or any Primary Financing Party; (c) all reasonable costs and expenses

     8.1.   Cooperation with the Lessee.
            ---------------------------

     The Primary Financing Parties and the Agent shall, at the expense of and to
the extent reasonably requested by the Lessee (but without assuming additional
liabilities on account thereof and only to the extent such is acceptable to the
Primary Financing Parties and/or the Agent , as applicable, in their reasonable
discretion), cooperate with the Lessee in connection with the Lessee satisfying
its covenant obligations contained in the Operative Agreements including without
limitation at any time and from time to time, promptly and duly executing and

     8.2.   Covenants of the Lessor.
            -----------------------

     The Lessor hereby agrees that so long as this Agreement is in effect:

                                       26

<PAGE>

            (a)  The Lessor will not create or permit to exist at any time,
     and will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take such action as may be
     necessary duly to discharge, or to cause to be discharged, all Lessor Liens
     on the Property attributable to it; provided, however, that the Lessor
     shall not be required to so discharge any such Lessor Lien while the same
     is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently
     prosecuted so long as such proceedings shall not materially and adversely
     affect the rights of the Lessee under the Lease and the other Operative
     Agreements or involve any material danger of impairment of the Liens of the
     Security Documents or of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, and shall not
     interfere with the use or disposition of, the Property or title thereto or
     any interest therein or the payment of Rent;

            (b)  The Lessor shall not (i) commence any case, proceeding or
     other action under any existing or future law of any jurisdiction, domestic
     or foreign, relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
     arrangement, winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, composition or other
     relief with respect to it or its debts, or (ii) seek appointment of a
     receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for all or any
     substantial benefit of the creditors of the Lessor; and the Lessor shall
     not take any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to,
     approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the acts set forth in this
     paragraph;

            (c)  The Lessor shall give prompt written notice to the Lessee,
     the Primary Financing Parties (other than the Lessor) and the Agent if the
     Lessor's location for purposes of the UCC shall cease to be North Carolina,
     or if the Lessor's principal place of business or chief executive office,
     or the office where the records concerning the accounts or contract rights
     relating to the Property are kept, shall cease to be located at One
     Wachovia Center, 301 South College Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28288;

            (d)  The Lessor shall take or refrain from taking such actions
     and grant or refrain from granting such approvals with respect to the
     Operative Agreements and/or relating to the Property in each case as
     directed in writing by the Agent (until such time as the Financing is paid
     in full) or, in connection with Section 8.5 hereof, the Lessee; provided,
     however, that notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph
     (d) the Lessor, the Agent and each of the other Primary Financing Parties
     each acknowledge, covenant and agree that neither the Lessor nor the Agent
     shall act or refrain from acting except in accordance with the provisions
     of any intercreditor agreement among such Persons; provided, further, that
     each of the Agent, the Primary Financing Parties (other than the Lessor)
     and the Lessee acknowledges, covenants and agrees that it will not instruct
     the Lessor to take any action in violation of the terms of any Operative
     Agreement; and

            (e)  The Lessor shall give the Lessee prompt written notice (a
     "Lessor Notice") following the Lessor's knowledge, but in any event
     promptly upon receipt by it of (x) notice from an acquiring Person as
     provided in the related underlying transaction documents that a disposition
     of property will occur or (y) an appraisal or other form of written
     valuation study, in either case that, in the exercise of the Lessor's
     reasonable judgment, would (regarding the Fair Market Sales Value of the
     Property as set forth in the Appraisal delivered pursuant to Section
     5.3(s)), in the case of clause (x) above, cause such Fair Market Sales
     Value of the Property to exceed fifty percent (50%) of (or, in the

                                       27

<PAGE>

     case of clause (y) above, provide the Lessor with adequate information to
     determine that, such Fair Market Sales Value of the Property exceeds fifty
     percent (50%) of) the fair market value (based on appraisals or other
     information in the Lessor's possession and delivered in connection with the
     consummation of such underlying transactions relating to various properties
     of the Lessor or received by the Lessor as described in clause (y) above)
     of all of the property owned (as determined in accordance with Lessor's
     financial reporting under GAAP and excluding those assets that are subject
     to leases that contain fixed price purchase options and residual value
     guarantees (a) where the title to such assets does not reside directly with
     the Lessor or (b) such assets were financed with either (i) non-recourse
     debt exceeding 95% of the cost of the such assets, or (ii) equity or other
     non-controlling interests that do not participate in all of the profits and
     losses of the Lessor) by the Lessor (the "Fifty Percent FMV Event"). In the
     event that a Lessor Notice is given, the Lessor, upon receipt of a written
     request from the Lessee, may, at its option, elect to either (i) obtain
     additional assets such that the gross asset value of the Property does not
     ever constitute more than fifty percent (50%) of the total assets of the
     Lessor (excluding those assets that are subject to leases that contain
     fixed price purchase options and residual value guarantees (a) where the
     title to such assets does not reside directly with the Lessor or (b) such
     assets were financed with either (i) non-recourse debt exceeding 95% of the
     cost of the such assets, or (ii) equity or other non-controlling interests
     that do not participate in all of the profits and losses of the Lessor),
     (ii) transfer its interests in all of the Property to another Affiliate of
     the Lessor such that the representations set forth in the Lessor
     Confirmation Letter remain correct, or (iii) obtain, at the Lessee's sole
     cost and expense, a SAS 97-type letter reasonably acceptable to the Lessee
     from the Lessor's auditor to certify that the Lessor is a voting interest
     entity as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46 (to be renewed as
     required). Nothing relating to the circumstances surrounding or the
     physical delivery of the Lessor Notice will in any way inhibit or prohibit
     the Lessee's right to replace the Lessor pursuant to Section 10.1(d).
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Lessor be required to
     disclose or provide access to any information to the extent that such
     disclosure or access would violate any law applicable to the Lessor or its
     Affiliates, including without limitation banking regulations applicable to
     national banks, or result in a breach of the Lessor's or any Affiliate's
     confidentiality policies or agreements. The parties hereto agree that the
     Lessee is the sole beneficiary of the matters addressed in this Section
     8.2(e).

            (f)  Upon the Lessee's prior written request, the Lessor shall
     provide to the Lessee at least fifteen (15) days prior to the end of each
     calendar quarter and at least forty-five (45) days prior to the end of each
     calendar year, a confirmed copy of the Lessor Confirmation Letter. The
     parties hereto agree that the Lessee is the sole beneficiary of the matters
     addressed in this Section 8.2(f).

            (g)  Lessor shall not finance any portion of the Lessor Advance
     with non-recourse debt to the extent that such financing of the Lessor
     Advance will cause more than 94% of the aggregate amount of the Financing
     to be funded with non-recourse debt.

     8.3.   Lessee Covenants, Consent and Acknowledgment.
            --------------------------------------------

            (a)  Each Credit Party acknowledges and agrees that the
     Borrower, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Security Agreement
     and the Mortgage Instruments, shall create Liens respecting the various
     personal property, fixtures and real property described therein in favor of
     the Agent. Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably consents to the creation,
     perfection and maintenance of such Liens. Each Credit Party shall, to the
     extent reasonably requested by any of the other parties hereto, cooperate
     with the other parties in connection with their covenants herein or in the
     other Operative Agreements and shall from time to time duly execute and
     deliver any and all such future instruments, documents and financing
     statements (and continuation statements related thereto) as any other party
     hereto may reasonably request.

            (b)  The Lessor hereby instructs each Credit Party, and each
     Credit Party hereby acknowledges and agrees, that until such time as the
     Financing is paid in full and the Liens evidenced by the Security Agreement
     and the Mortgage Instruments have been released (i) any and all Rent
     (excluding Excepted Payments which shall be payable to each Person as
     appropriate) and any and all other amounts of any kind or type under any of
     the Operative Agreements due and owing or payable to any Person shall
     instead be paid directly to the Agent (excluding Excepted Payments which
     shall be payable to each Person as appropriate) or as the Agent may direct
     from time to time, and (ii) each Credit Party shall cause all notices,
     certificates, financial statements, communications and other information
     which are delivered, or are required to be delivered, to the Lessor, to
     also to be delivered at the same time to the Agent.

            (c)  No Credit Party shall consent to or permit any amendment,
     supplement or other modification of the terms or provisions of any
     Operative Agreement to which it is a party except in accordance with

            (ff) Lessee shall not, nor shall it permit anyone authorized to act
     on its behalf to, take any action which would subject the Property, the
     Operative Agreements, the issuance or sale of the Credit Notes, the making

Lessee or such other Credit Party directly to the Agent as more particularly
provided in Section 8.3 hereof.

     8.5.   Grant of Easements, etc.
            -----------------------

     The Agent, the Credit Note Purchasers, the Mortgage Lenders and the Lessor
hereby agree that, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, and until such time as the Agent gives instructions to the contrary
to the Lessor after the occurrence and continuance of such Event of Default, the
Lessor shall, from time to time at the request of the Lessee (and with the prior
consent of the Agent), in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Lease or the other Operative Agreements, (i) grant easements and other rights in
the nature of easements, restrictions, covenants, rights of way or plats with
respect to the Property, (ii) release existing easements or other rights in the
nature of easements, restrictions, covenants, rights of way or plats which are
for the benefit of the Property, (iii) execute and deliver to any Person any
instrument appropriate to confirm or effect such grants or releases, and (iv)
execute and deliver to any Person such other documents or materials in
connection with the acquisition, development, construction, testing or operation
of the Property, including without limitation reciprocal easement agreements,
construction contracts, operating agreements, development agreements, plats,
replats or subdivision documents; provided, that each of the agreements referred
to in this Section 8.5 shall be of the type normally executed by the Lessee in
the ordinary course of the Lessee's business and shall be on commercially
reasonable terms so as not to diminish the value of the Property in any material
respect or otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect.

     8.6.   Appointment of the Agent by the Primary Financing Parties.
            ---------------------------------------------------------

            (a)  The Secured Parties acknowledge and agree and direct that
     the rights and remedies of the beneficiaries of the Lien of the Security
     Documents shall be exercised by the Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties
     in accordance with the provisions of the

                                       38

<PAGE>

     Intercreditor Agreement; provided, in all cases, the Agent shall allocate
     payments and other amounts received in accordance with Section 8.7 and the
     Intercreditor Agreement. The Agent is further appointed to provide notices
     under the Operative Agreements on behalf of the Lessor and each Primary
     Financing Party (as determined by the Agent, in its reasonable discretion),
     to receive notices under the Operative Agreements on behalf of the Lessor
     and each Primary Financing Party and (subject to Section 8.5) to take such
     other action under the Operative Agreements on behalf of the Lessor as the
     Agent shall determine in its reasonable discretion from time to time. The
     Agent hereby accepts such appointments. Further, the Agent shall be
     entitled to take such action on behalf of the Lessor as is delegated to the
     Agent under any Operative Agreement (whether express or implied) as may be
     reasonably incidental thereto.

            (b)  Each Primary Financing Party hereby designates and appoints
     the Agent as the agent of such Primary Financing Party under this Agreement
     and the other Operative Agreements, and each such Primary Financing Party
     authorizes the Agent, in such capacity, to execute the Operative Agreements
     as agent for and on behalf of such Primary Financing Party, to take such
     action on behalf of such Primary Financing Party under the provisions of
     this Agreement and the other Operative Agreements and to exercise such
     powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by
     the terms of this Agreement and other Operative Agreements, together with
     such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Subject to the
     terms of the Operative Agreements (including without limitation the
     Intercreditor Agreement), each of the Primary Financing Parties directs the
     Agent to exercise such powers, make such decisions and otherwise perform
     such duties as are delegated to the Agent hereunder or thereunder.
     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement,
     the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
     expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Primary
     Financing Party, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities,
     duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any
     other Operative Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent.

            (c)  The Agent may execute any of its duties under this
     Agreement and the other Operative Agreements by or through agents or
     attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
     matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for
     the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by
     it with reasonable care.

            (d)  Neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
     employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (a) liable for
     any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under
     or in connection with this Agreement or any other Operative Agreement
     (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence, willful misconduct
     or its or such Person's failure to use ordinary care in the handling of
     funds) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Primary Financing
     Parties for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
     the Borrower or the Lessee or any officer thereof contained in this
     Agreement or any other Operative Agreement or in any certificate, report,
     statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by
     the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
     Operative Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
     enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Operative
     Agreement or for any failure of the

                                       39

<PAGE>

     Borrower or the Lessee to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
     The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Primary Financing Party
     to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of
     the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other
     Operative Agreement, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the
     Borrower or the Lessee.

            (e)  The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
     protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
     certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message,
     statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be
     genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
     Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
     (including without limitation counsel to the Borrower or the Lessee),
     independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent
     may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all
     purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer
     thereof shall have been filed with the Agent. The Agent shall be fully
     justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or
     any other Operative Agreement unless it shall first receive such advice or
     concurrence of the Majority Secured Parties, the Majority Credit Note
     Purchasers, the Majority Mortgage Lenders or all the Primary Financing
     Parties, as the case may be, as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement or
     any other Operative Agreement or it shall first be indemnified to its
     satisfaction by the Primary Financing Parties against any and all liability
     and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing
     to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
     acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other
     Operative Agreements in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, and
     such and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
     binding upon all the Primary Financing Parties and all future holders of
     the Notes.

            (f)  The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice
     of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default (other than the
     failure of Lessee to pay Basic Rent to the Agent pursuant to the terms and
     conditions of the Operative Agreements as and when due) hereunder unless
     the Agent has received written notice from a Primary Financing Party, the
     Lessee or the Borrower referring to this Agreement or such other Operative
     Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that
     such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives
     such a notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Primary Financing
     Parties and the Lessee. The Agent shall take such action with respect to
     such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed in
     accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; provided, that
     unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent
     may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
     taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
     shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Primary Financing
     Parties; provided, further, the foregoing shall not limit the rights of the
     Majority Secured Parties, the Majority Credit Note Purchasers, the Majority
     Mortgage Lenders or all the Primary Financing Parties, as the case may be,
     as described in this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement.

            (g)  Each Primary Financing Party expressly acknowledges that
     neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
     attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates

                                       40

<PAGE>

     has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the
     Agent hereinafter taken, including without limitation any review of the
     affairs of the Borrower or the Lessee, shall be deemed to constitute any
     representation or warranty by the Agent to any Primary Financing Party.
     Each Primary Financing Party represents to the Agent that it has,
     independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Primary
     Financing Party, and based on such documents and information as it has
     deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
     business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
     creditworthiness of the Borrower and/or the Lessee and made its own
     decision to purchase its Credit Notes, make its Mortgage Loans or make its
     Lessor Advance hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Primary
     Financing Party also represents that it will, independently and without
     reliance upon the Agent or any other Primary Financing Party, and based on
     such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
     continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
     taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Operative
     Agreements, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
     itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
     condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and/or the Lessee. The Agent
     agrees to provide to the Primary Financing Parties notices, reports and
     other documents that are customarily provided by the Agent in its capacity
     as Agent in transactions similar to the transactions contemplated hereby
     and by the other Operative Agreements. Except for notices, reports and
     other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Primary Financing
     Parties by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or
     responsibility to provide any Primary Financing Party with any credit or
     other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition
     (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or
     the Lessee which may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its
     officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

            (h)  The Primary Financing Parties agree to indemnify the Agent,
     in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower or
     the Lessee and without limiting any obligation of the Borrower or the
     Lessee under and in accordance with the terms of the Operative Agreements
     to do so), ratably according to their respective Commitment Percentages in
     effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section
     (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Credit
     Notes, the Mortgage Notes and the Lessor Advance shall have been paid in
     full, ratably in accordance with their Commitment Percentages immediately
     prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
     losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
     disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including
     without limitation at any time following the payment of the Credit Notes,
     the Mortgage Notes and the Lessor Advance) be imposed on, incurred by or
     asserted against any of them in any way relating to or arising out of, the
     Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Operative Agreements or any
     documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the
     transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted
     by any of them under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided,
     that no Primary Financing Party shall be liable for the payment of any
     portion of such liabilities, obligations, damages, penalties, actions,
     judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from
     the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent, or its failure to
     use ordinary care in the handling of funds. The

                                       41

<PAGE>

     agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Credit Notes,
     the Mortgage Loans and the Lessor Advance and all other amounts payable
     hereunder.

            (i)  The Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits
     from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and/or
     the Lessee as though the Agent were not the Agent hereunder and under the
     other Operative Agreements.

            (j) (i) The Agent may resign at any time as the Agent upon sixty
            (60) days' notice to the Primary Financing Parties, the Borrower
            and, so long as no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
            continuing, the Lessee. If the Agent shall resign as the Agent under
            this Agreement, a successor Agent shall be appointed by the Majority
            Secured Parties, which successor Agent shall be subject to the
            approval of, so long as no Lease Event of Default shall have
            occurred and be continuing, the Lessee, such approval not to be
            unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no successor Agent is appointed
            prior to the effective date of the resignation of the resigning
            Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Primary
            Financing Parties and subject to the approval of, so long as no
            Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
            Lessee, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, a
            successor Agent. Any successor Agent, however appointed, shall be a
            national banking association or a state chartered bank doing
            business within the United States of America and having a combined
            capital and surplus of at least $350,000,000, and having a Debt
            Rating of "A" or better on the date of such appointment if there be
            such an institution willing, able and legally qualified to perform
            the duties of the Agent hereunder upon reasonable or customary
            terms. If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as the Agent
            by the date which is sixty (60) days following a retiring Agent's
            notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's notice of resignation
            shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Primary
            Financing Parties shall perform all of the duties of the Agent until
            such time, if any, as the Majority Secured Parties appoint a
            successor Agent, as provided for above. Upon the effective date of
            such resignation, only such successor Agent shall succeed to all the
            rights, powers and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent"
            shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Agent's rights,
            powers and duties in such capacity shall be terminated. After any
            retiring Agent resigns hereunder as the Agent, the provisions of
            this Section 8.6 shall inure to such retiring Agent's benefit as to
            any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the
            Agent under this Agreement.

            (ii) The Agent may be removed (x) by any of the Majority Credit Note
            Purchasers, the Majority Mortgage Lenders or the Lessor in the case
            of fraud, misappropriation of funds or the commission of illegal
            acts by the Agent or where the Agent has failed to perform its
            obligations hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement in any
            material respect, (y) any time at the request of any Primary
            Financing Party, but only with the consent of the Majority Credit
            Note Purchasers, the Majority Mortgage Lenders, the Lessor and so
            long as no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
            continuing, the Lessee, or (z) at any time that an Event of Default
            shall have occurred and be continuing, by the Majority Credit Note
            Purchasers. Any such removal shall be effective upon the

                                       42

<PAGE>

            acceptance of appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with
            the provisions of paragraph (i) of this Section 8.6(j); provided,
            however, to the extent the Agent being replaced pursuant to clause
            (x) of this Section 8.6(j)(ii) is also a Credit Note Purchaser, a
            Mortgage Lender or the Lessor, such Person shall not be permitted to
            vote in connection with the appointment or approval of a successor
            Agent pursuant to paragraph (i) of this Section 8.6(j).

            (k)  Other than the exercise of reasonable care to assure the
     safe custody of the Collateral while being held by the Agent hereunder or
     under any other Operative Agreement, the Agent shall have no duty or
     liability to preserve rights pertaining thereto, it being understood and
     agreed that the Lessee shall be responsible for preservation of all rights
     in the Collateral, and the Agent shall be relieved of all responsibility
     for the Collateral upon surrendering it or tendering the surrender of it to
     the Lessee. The Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in
     the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the
     Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the
     Agent accords its own property, which shall be no less than the treatment
     employed by a reasonable and prudent agent in the industry, it being
     understood that the Agent shall not have responsibility for taking any
     necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any
     of the Collateral.

     8.7.   Collection and Allocation of Payments and Other Amounts; Special
            ----------------------------------------------------------------
            Provision Regarding Post-Expiration Date Sales.
            ----------------------------------------------

            (a)  The Lessee has agreed pursuant to Section 5.10 and
     otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to pay to (i) the
     Agent any and all Rent (excluding Excepted Payments) and any and all other
     amounts of any kind or type under any of the Operative Agreements due and
     owing or payable by the Lessee to any party hereto and (ii) each Person as
     appropriate the Excepted Payments. Promptly after receipt, the Agent shall
     apply and allocate, in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.7, such
     amounts received from the Lessee and all other payments, receipts and other
     consideration of any kind whatsoever received by the Agent pursuant to the
     Security Agreement or otherwise received by the Agent, the Lessor or any of
     the Primary Financing Parties in connection with the Collateral, the
     Security Documents or any of the other Operative Agreements.

            (b)  Except as set forth in Sections 8.7(b)(ii) and 8.7(d) and
     except for Excepted Payments, payments and other amounts received by the
     Agent (or the Lessor, in which case such amount shall be paid to the Agent
     for distribution in accordance with this Section 8.7(b)) from time to time
     in accordance with the terms of subparagraph (a) shall be applied and
     allocated as follows (subject in all cases to Section 8.7(c)):

                 (i)   Any such payment or amount identified as or deemed to be
            Basic Rent, any amount in respect of any Casualty, Condemnation or
            Environmental Violation pursuant to Sections 15.1(a) or 15.1(g) of
            the Lease (excluding any payments in respect thereof which are
            payable to the Lessee in accordance with the Lease), any amount
            equal to any payment identified as proceeds of the sale or other
            disposition (or lease upon the exercise of remedies) of the Property
            to a third party or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to Article
            XXII of the Lease or the

                                       43

<PAGE>

            exercise of remedies under the Security Documents or otherwise or
            the exercise of foreclosure remedies under the Lease, any payment in
            respect of excess wear and tear pursuant to Section 22.3 of the
            Lease, any payment pursuant to Section 22.1(b) of the Lease (or
            otherwise) of the Maximum Residual Guarantee Amount, any payment of
            Termination Value, any payment by any Guarantor, any payment by the
            Lessee under the Structural Guaranty, and any other amount received
            by the Agent or the Lessor, as the case may be, shall be applied and
            allocated by the Agent: first, to the Primary Financing Parties for
            application and allocation to any and all amounts owing under the
            Operative Agreements to the Primary Financing Parties in accordance
            with the terms and provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement; and
            second, any excess shall be paid to the Lessee or such Person or
            Persons as the Lessee may designate.

                 (ii)  An amount equal to any such payment identified as
            Supplemental Rent payable to the Agent, the Lessor or any other
            Primary Financing Party shall be applied and allocated by the Agent
            to the payment of any amounts then owing to the Agent, the Lessor,
            the other Primary Financing Parties, and the other parties to the
            Operative Agreements (or any of them) (other than any such amounts
            payable pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 8.7(b))
            as shall be appropriate based upon the purposes for which such
            amount of Supplemental Rent is payable; provided, however, that
            Supplemental Rent received after the occurrence and continuance of
            an Event of Default shall be applied and allocated by the Agent:
            first, to the Primary Financing Parties for application and
            allocation to any and all amounts owing under the Operative
            Agreements to the Primary Financing Parties in accordance with the
            terms and provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement; and second, any
            excess shall be paid to the Lessee or such Person or Persons as the
            Lessee may designate.

                 (iii) The Agent in its reasonable judgment shall identify the
            nature of each payment or amount received by the Agent and apply and
            allocate each such amount in the manner specified above.

            (c)  Notwithstanding any provision contained herein or in any
     other Operative Agreement to the contrary, upon the payment in full of the
     Credit Notes, the Mortgage Notes and all other amounts then due and owing
     by the Borrower to the Credit Note Purchasers and the Mortgage Lenders
     hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement, the payment in full of
     the Lessor Advance, all Lessor Yield and all other amounts then due and
     owing by the Lessee to the Lessor hereunder or under any other Operative
     Agreement and the payment in full of all other amounts then due and owing
     to the Financing Parties pursuant to the Operative Agreements, any moneys
     remaining with the Agent shall be returned to the Lessee or its designee.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the Lessee shall be
     automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any
     payment by or on behalf of the Lessee is rescinded or must be otherwise
     restored by any Financing Party, whether as a result of any proceedings in
     bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Lessee agrees that it
     will, subject to the limitations expressly set forth in the Operative
     Agreements, indemnify each Financing Party on demand for all reasonable
     costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees of
     counsel) incurred by any Financing Party in connection with such rescission
     or

                                       44

<PAGE>

     restoration, including without limitation any such costs and expenses
     incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment
     constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any
     bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

            (d)  If possession of the Property is delivered to Lessor pursuant
     to Section 22.6 of the Lease, then at the end of each calendar month
     following the Expiration Date, any amounts received by the Agent during the
     calendar month then ended as proceeds from the sale, rental, or other

     which the Agent or the Lessor determines is allocable to, the Property,

            ----------------------------

     If the Lessee shall at any time purchase the Property pursuant to the Lease

Property from the Liens created by the Security Documents to the extent of its
interest therein. In addition, upon the termination of the Commitments and the

the Lessee hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement, the Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to release the Property from the Liens created by the
Security Documents to the extent of its interest therein. Upon request of the
Borrower following any such release, the Agent shall, at the sole cost and
expense of the Lessee, execute and deliver to the Borrower and the Lessee such
documents as the Borrower or the Lessee shall reasonably request to evidence
such release.

            ----------------------------------

     (a)  The Lessor shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, control,
use, make any payment in respect of, register, record, insure, inspect, sell,

pursuant to the Operative Agreements, may, at the expense and, so long as no
Lease Default or Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
with the consent of Lessee employ agents, attorneys, accountants, and auditors
and enter into agreements with any of them and the Lessor shall not be liable
for the default or misconduct of any such agents, attorneys, accountants or
auditors if such agents, attorneys, accountants or auditors shall have been
selected by it with reasonable care.

     8.10.  No Representations or Warranties as to the Property or Operative
            ----------------------------------------------------------------
            Agreements.
            ----------

     THE LESSOR MAKES (I) NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AS TO THE TITLE, VALUE, USE, CONDITION, DESIGN, OPERATION,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR USE OF THE PROPERTY (OR ANY PART THEREOF), OR ANY
OTHER REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH
RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY (OR ANY PART THEREOF) AND THE LESSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE

                                       46

<PAGE>

FOR ANY LATENT, HIDDEN, OR PATENT DEFECT THEREIN OR THE FAILURE OF THE PROPERTY,
OR ANY PART THEREOF, TO COMPLY WITH ANY LEGAL REQUIREMENT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
SET FORTH IN THE OPERATIVE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING SECTION 6.1(l) AND THE LAST
SENTENCE OF SECTION 8.9(a) HEREOF, AND (II) NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO
THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY OPERATIVE AGREEMENT AS AGAINST ANY PERSON

OTHER THAN THE LESSOR CONTAINED IN ANY THEREOF.

     8.11.  Reliance; Advice of Counsel.
            ---------------------------

     The Lessor shall not incur any liability to any Person in acting upon any
signature, instrument, notice, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate,
report, opinion, bond or other document or paper reasonably believed by it to be
genuine and believed by it in good faith to be signed by the proper party or
parties. The Lessor may accept and rely upon a certified copy of a resolution of
the board of directors or other governing body of any corporate party as
conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted by such body and
that the same is in full force and effect. As to any fact or matter the manner
of ascertainment of which is not specifically prescribed herein, the Lessor may
for all purposes of the Operative Agreements rely on an Officer's Certificate of
the relevant party, as to such fact or matter, and such certificate shall
constitute full protection to the Lessor for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it reasonably in good faith in reliance thereon. In the administration
of the Lessor's duties, the Lessor may execute and perform its powers and duties
directly or through agents or attorneys and may consult with counsel,
accountants and other skilled Persons to be selected and employed by it, and the
Lessor shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted reasonably in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel,
accountants or other skilled Persons and not contrary to the Operative
Agreements.

     8.12.  Amendments to Lessee Credit Agreement.
            -------------------------------------

     The Lessee hereby agrees to furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the Agent
and each of the Credit Note Purchasers, promptly upon the effectiveness thereof,
notice of any additions, amendments or modifications to the general corporate,
financial and negative covenants (and related definitions) set forth in the
Lessee Credit Agreement to the extent the same are not included in, or are more
favorable to the lenders party thereto than the covenants set forth in Sections
8.3, 8.3A or 8.3B of, this Agreement. In such event, the Lessee hereby agrees to
make modifications or supplements to the covenants set forth in Sections 8.3,
8.3A and 8.3B of this Agreement in a manner consistent with such addition,
amendment, modification or supplement made to such covenants in the Lessee
Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lessee hereby further
agrees that such changes, additions, modifications or supplements to such
covenants shall be deemed immediately and automatically effective hereunder upon
the effectiveness of such modification or addition to such covenants set forth
in the Lessee Credit Agreement, without any further action on the part of the
Majority Credit Note Purchasers, including, without limitation, the entering
into of a written amendment or supplement to any Operative Agreement. The
parties nevertheless agree to promptly enter into a written amendment or
supplement memorializing any of such changes, additions, modifications or
supplements upon the request of any other party.

            ---------------

     In furtherance of Section 5.1 of the Lease, each of the Financing Parties
hereby acknowledges and agrees that so long as no Lease Event of Default shall
exist and be continuing, neither the Agent nor any Primary Financing Party will
disturb the possession of Lessee, will terminate the Lease or join Lessee in
summary ejectment or foreclosure proceedings (unless such joinder is required to
effect such ejectment or foreclosure proceedings against the Borrower, but
subject to the non-disturbance rights of Lessee hereunder), and shall recognize
the leasehold estate and contractual rights of the Lessee under the Lease,
including without limitation the Purchase Option granted thereunder to the
Lessee, it being understood that such leasehold estate and rights of the Lessee
shall be unaffected by any foreclosure action or enforcement of remedies by the
Agent or any Primary Financing Party hereunder so long as no Lease Event of
Default shall exist and be continuing.

                    SECTION 9. MORTGAGE NOTE LOAN AGREEMENT.

     9.1.   The Lessee's Mortgage Note Loan Agreement Rights.
            ------------------------------------------------

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Mortgage Note
Loan Agreement, the Agent, the Borrower, the Mortgage Lenders and the Lessee
hereby agree that, prior to the occurrence and continuation of any Lease Default
or Lease Event of Default, the Lessee shall have the following rights:

            (a)  [Reserved];

            (b)  [Reserved];

            (c)  the right to exercise the conversion and continuation options
     pursuant to Section 2.7 of the Mortgage Note Loan Agreement;

            (d)  the right to receive any notice and any certificate, in each
     case issued pursuant to Section 2.11(a) of the Mortgage Note Loan
     Agreement; and

            (e)  the right to replace any Mortgage Lender pursuant to Section
     2.11(b) of the Mortgage Note Loan Agreement.

                        SECTION 10. TRANSFER OF INTEREST.

     10.1.  Restrictions on Transfer.
            ------------------------

     (a)  The Lessor may, subject to the rights of the Lessee under the
Lease and the other Operative Agreements, the rights of the Primary Financing
Parties under the Operative Agreements and to the Lien of the applicable
Security Documents, directly or indirectly, assign, convey, or otherwise
transfer all but not less than all of its right, title and interest in or to the
Property, the Lease and the other Operative Agreements (including without
limitation any right

                                       48

<PAGE>

to indemnification thereunder), and any other document relating to the Property
or any interest in the Property as provided in the Lease to any Eligible Lessor
for any reason, but only with the prior written consent of the Majority Secured
Parties (the consent of any individual Secured Party not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and (provided, no Lease Default or Lease Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing) with the consent of the Lessee (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Lessor hereby agrees that the Lessee
shall be deemed to have acted reasonably and shall have exercised reasonable
discretion in the event and to the extent the Lessee has withheld its consent to
or refused to approve any requested transfer, assignment, conveyance or
appointment by the Lessor under this Section 10.1(a) based on a reasonable
belief that the requested transfer, assignment, conveyance or appointment will
adversely affect the accounting by the Lessee of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and under the other Operative Agreements in accordance with GAAP. The
provisions of the first sentence of this Section 10.1(a) shall not apply to the
obligations of the Lessor to transfer the Property to the Lessee or a third
party purchaser pursuant to Article XXII of the Lease upon payment for the
Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Lease. The Lessee
may not assign any of the Operative Agreements or any of its rights or
obligations thereunder or with respect to the Property in whole or in part to
any Person without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Primary
Financing Parties. Each Credit Note Purchaser may participate, assign or
transfer all or a portion of its interest hereunder and under the other
Operative Agreements only in accordance with the provisions of the Note Purchase
Agreement, and each Mortgage Lender may participate, assign or transfer all or a
portion of its interest hereunder and under the other Operative Agreements only
in accordance with the Mortgage Note Loan Agreement.

     (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.1(a), no
consent shall be required from the Agent, the Lessee or any Primary Financing
Party (but Lessor shall provide one hundred eighty (180) days (or such shorter
period as required by the Legal Requirement giving rise to the assignment,
conveyance, appointment or transfer contemplated by this Section 10.1(b))
written notice to the Agent and the Lessee) in connection with any assignment,
conveyance, appointment or transfer by the Lessor required by any Legal
Requirement (including pursuant to the direction or recommendation of any
Governmental Authority) of all or any of its right, title or interest in or to
the Property, the Lease and the other Operative Agreements (including without
limitation any right to indemnification thereunder), or any other document
relating to the Property or any interest in the Property as provided in the
Lease to an Eligible Lessor; provided, in such case, so long as no Lease Default
or Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall
have the right to require the Lessor (unless such transfer or conveyance has
already occurred, in which case the Lessee shall have the right to require such
transferee) to transfer its interest to an Eligible Lessor selected by the
Lessee, in its reasonable discretion; provided, further, Lessee shall be
responsible for any cost or expense incurred by the Lessor in connection with
any assignment, conveyance, appointment or transfer by the Lessor pursuant to
this Section 10.1(b).

     (c)  The Lessee agrees to indemnify the Lessor for any actual loss,
claim or increased costs incurred by the Lessor and quantified to Lessee in
writing by Lessor in reasonable detail as a result of any change in GAAP that
adversely affects the Lessor; provided, however, in the case of such a change in
GAAP that adversely affects the Lessor, as long as no Lease Default or Lease
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall have the
right to require the Lessor to transfer its interest to an Eligible Lessor
selected by the Lessee, in its reasonable discretion; provided, further, nothing
in the preceding proviso shall limit the

                                       49

<PAGE>

obligation of the Lessee to provide the indemnity set forth in this Section
10.1(c). Lessor hereby agrees to notify the Lessee within thirty (30) days after
a Responsible Officer of Lessor obtains knowledge of an actual or proposed
change in GAAP that would require Lessee's performance under this Section
10.1(c); provided, notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessor agrees to use
reasonable efforts to notify Lessee of any such change in GAAP that adversely
affects the Lessor prior to the effective date of any such change in GAAP.

     (d)  (i)  Lessee shall have the right at any time during the
Term to require the Lessor to transfer its interest in the Property and the
Operative Agreements to an Eligible Lessor selected by the Lessee, in its
reasonable discretion; provided, Lessee shall give the Agent (on behalf of the
Secured Parties) reasonable prior written notice of any transfer pursuant to
this Section 10.1(d)(i).

          (ii) If a Bankruptcy Event of the parent company of the Lessor shall
     have occurred and be continuing, the Majority Credit Note Purchasers shall
     have the right to require the Lessor to transfer its interest in the
     Property and the Operative Agreements to an Eligible Lessor selected by the
     Majority Credit Note Purchasers, in their reasonable discretion; provided,
     nothing in this Section 10.1(d)(ii) shall be deemed to prevent the Lessee
     from exercising its rights (or otherwise affect the Lessee's rights) under
     Section 10.1(d)(i) to require any transferee Eligible Lessor selected by
     the Majotiy Note Purchasers pursuant to this Section 10.1(d)(ii) to
     transfer its interest in the Property and the Operative Agreements to an
     Eligible Lessor selected by the Lessee, in its reasonable discretion.

     10.2.  Effect of Transfer.
            ------------------

     From and after any transfer effected in accordance with this Section 10,
the transferor shall be released, to the extent of such transfer, from its
liability hereunder and under the other documents to which it is a party in
respect of obligations to be performed on or after the date of such transfer;
provided, however, that any transferor shall remain liable hereunder and under
such other documents to the extent that the transferee shall not have assumed
the obligations of the transferor thereunder. Upon any transfer by the Lessor or
any other Primary Financing Party as above provided, any such transferee shall
assume the obligations of the Lessor or such Primary Financing Party, as the
case may be, and shall be deemed the "Lessor" and/or a "Primary Financing
Party", as the case may be, for all purposes of such documents and each
reference herein to the transferor shall thereafter be deemed a reference to
such transferee for all purposes, except as provided in the preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding any transfer of all of the transferor's interest as provided in
this Section 10, the transferor shall be entitled to all benefits accrued and
all rights vested prior to such transfer including without limitation rights to
indemnification under any such document.

                          SECTION 11. INDEMNIFICATION.

     11.1.  General Indemnity.
            -----------------

     Subject to the provisions of Sections 11.6 and 11.7 and whether or not any
of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, the Indemnity
Provider hereby assumes

                                       50

<PAGE>

liability for and agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Person on an After Tax Basis from and against any Claims, which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Person by any third party,
including without limitation Claims arising from the negligence of an
Indemnified Person (but not to the extent such Claims arise from the (v) failure
by an Indemnified Person to comply with applicable state or federal banking Laws
or other Laws, (w) acts or omissions that occur after the Credit Notes, the
Mortgage Loans, the Lessor Advance and all other amounts outstanding under or
pursuant to the Operative Agreements have been paid in full and the Lessee has
either purchased the Property in accordance with the terms of the Operative
Agreements or relinquished its interest in the Property in accordance with the
terms of the Operative Agreements, (x) gross negligence, (y) willful misconduct
of such Indemnified Person itself, as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction (as opposed to gross negligence or willful misconduct imputed to
such Indemnified Person) or (z) breach of such Indemnified Person's obligations
under this Agreement, the Lease or any other Operative Agreement, except any
breach by any Indemnified Person caused by any breach by any Credit Party of any
obligation of any Credit Party pursuant to the Operative Agreements) in any way
relating to or arising or alleged to arise out of the execution, delivery,
performance or enforcement of this Agreement, the Lease or any other Operative
Agreement or on or with respect to the Property or any component thereof,
including without limitation Claims in any way relating to or arising or alleged
to arise out of (a) the financing, refinancing, purchase, ownership, design,
construction, refurbishment, development, delivery, acceptance, nondelivery,
leasing, subleasing, possession, use, occupancy, operation, maintenance, repair,
modification or any disposition of the Property or any part thereof; (b) any
latent or other defects in the Property or any portion thereof whether or not
discoverable by an Indemnified Person or the Indemnity Provider; (c) a violation
of Environmental Laws, Environmental Claims or other loss of or damage to any
property or the environment relating to the Property, the Lease or the Indemnity
Provider (collectively, all such items referenced in this Section 11.1(c) may be
referred to as the "Environmental Matters"); (d) the Operative Agreements, or
any transaction contemplated thereby; (e) any breach by the Indemnity Provider
of any of its representations or warranties under the Operative Agreements to
which the Indemnity Provider is a party or failure by the Indemnity Provider to
perform or observe any covenant or agreement to be performed by it under any of
the Operative Agreements; (f) the transactions contemplated hereby or by any
other Operative Agreement, in respect of the application of Parts 4 and 5 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA; (g) personal injury, death or property damage,
including without limitation Claims based on strict or absolute liability in
tort; and (h) any fees, expenses and/or other assessments by any business park
or any other similar entity for the Property.

     If a written Claim is made against any Indemnified Person or if any
proceeding shall be commenced against such Indemnified Person (including without
limitation a written notice of such proceeding), for any Claim, such Indemnified
Person shall promptly notify the Indemnity Provider in writing and shall not
take action with respect to such Claim without the consent of the Indemnity
Provider for thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice by the Indemnity
Provider; provided, however, that in the case of any such Claim, if action shall
be required by law or regulation to be taken prior to the end of such period of
thirty (30) days, such Indemnified Person shall endeavor to, in such notice to
the Indemnity Provider, inform the Indemnity Provider of such shorter period,
and no action shall be taken with respect to such Claim without the consent of
the Indemnity Provider before seven (7) days before the end of such shorter
period (unless required by law or regulation prior to the end of such seven (7)
day period); provided, further, that the failure of such Indemnified Person to
give the notices referred to in this sentence

                                       51

<PAGE>

shall not diminish the Indemnity Provider's obligation hereunder except to the
extent such failure precludes in all respects the Indemnity Provider from
contesting such Claim.

     If, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice from the Indemnified
Person (or such shorter period as the Indemnified Person has notified the
Indemnity Provider is required by law or regulation for the Indemnified Person
to respond to such Claim), the Indemnity Provider shall request in writing that
such Indemnified Person respond to such Claim, the Indemnified Person shall, at
the expense of the Indemnity Provider, in good faith conduct and control such
action (including without limitation by pursuit of appeals); provided, however,
that (A) if such Claim, in the Indemnity Provider's reasonable discretion, can
be pursued by the Indemnity Provider on behalf of or in the name of such
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person, at the Indemnity Provider's request,
shall allow the Indemnity Provider to conduct and control the response to such
Claim and (B) in the case of any Claim (and notwithstanding the provisions of
the foregoing subsection (A), the Indemnified Person may request the Indemnity
Provider to conduct and control the response to such Claim with counsel to be
selected by the Indemnity Provider after the solicitation and consideration of
any advice provided by such Indemnified Person; provided, however, that any
Indemnified Person may retain separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnity
Provider in the event of a material conflict of interest between such
Indemnified Person and the Indemnity Provider) by, in the sole discretion of the
Person conducting and controlling the response to such Claim (1) resisting
payment thereof, (2) not paying the same except under protest, if protest is
necessary and proper, (3) if the payment be made, using reasonable efforts to
obtain a refund thereof in appropriate administrative and judicial proceedings,
or (4) taking such other action as is reasonably requested by the Indemnity
Provider from time to time.

     The party controlling the response to any Claim shall consult in good faith
with the non-controlling party and shall keep the non-controlling party
reasonably informed as to the conduct of the response to such Claim; provided,
that all decisions ultimately shall be made in the discretion of the controlling
party. The parties agree that an Indemnified Person may at any time decline to
take further action with respect to the response to such Claim and may settle
such Claim if such Indemnified Person shall waive its rights to any indemnity
from the Indemnity Provider that otherwise would be payable in respect of such
Claim (and any future Claim, the pursuit of which is precluded by reason of such
resolution of such Claim) and shall pay to the Indemnity Provider any amount
previously paid or advanced by the Indemnity Provider pursuant to this Section
11.1 by way of indemnification or advance for the payment of an amount regarding
such Claim.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.1, an
Indemnified Person shall not be required to take any action unless (A) the
Indemnity Provider shall have agreed to pay and shall pay to such Indemnified
Person on demand and on an After Tax Basis all reasonable costs, losses and
expenses that such Indemnified Person actually incurs in connection with such
Claim, including without limitation all reasonable legal, accounting and
investigatory fees and disbursements and, if the Indemnified Person has informed
the Indemnity Provider that it intends to contest such Claim (whether or not the
control of the contest is then assumed by the Indemnity Provider), the Indemnity
Provider shall have agreed that the Claim is an indemnifiable Claim hereunder,
(B) in the case of a Claim that must be pursued in the name of an Indemnified
Person (or an Affiliate thereof), the amount of the potential indemnity (taking
into account all similar or logically related Claims that have been or could be
raised for which the Indemnity

                                       52

<PAGE>

Provider may be liable to pay an indemnity under this Section 11.1) exceeds
$250,000 (or such lesser amount as may be subsequently agreed between the
Indemnity Provider and the Indemnified Person), (C) the Indemnified Person shall
have reasonably determined that the action to be taken will not result in any
material danger of sale, forfeiture or loss of the Property, or any part thereof
or interest therein, will not interfere with the payment of Rent, and will not
result in risk of criminal liability, (D) if such Claim shall involve the
payment of any amount prior to the resolution of such Claim, the Indemnity
Provider shall provide to the Indemnified Person an interest-free advance in an
amount equal to the amount that the Indemnified Person is reasonably required to
pay upon advice of counsel (with no additional net after-tax cost to such
Indemnified Person) prior to the date such payment is due, (E) in the case of a
Claim, including any appeal thereof, that must be pursued in the name of an
Indemnified Person (or an Affiliate thereof), the Indemnity Provider shall have
caused to be provided to such Indemnified Person advice, but not an opinion, of
independent counsel selected by the Indemnity Provider and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person stating that a reasonable basis exists to
contest such Claim (or, in the case of an appeal of an adverse determination,
advice, but not an opinion, of such counsel to the effect that the position
asserted in such appeal will more likely than not prevail) and (F) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. In no event shall an Indemnified
Person be required to appeal an adverse judicial determination to the United
States Supreme Court. In addition, an Indemnified Person shall not be required
to contest any Claim in its name (or that of an Affiliate) if the subject matter
thereof shall be of a continuing nature and shall have previously been decided
adversely by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the contest
provisions of this Section 11.1, unless there shall have been a change in law
(or interpretation thereof) and the Indemnified Person shall have received, at
the Indemnity Provider's expense, advice, but not an opinion, of independent
counsel selected by the Indemnity Provider and reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Person stating that as a result of such change in law (or
interpretation thereof), it is more likely than not that the Indemnified Person
will prevail in such contest. In no event shall the Indemnity Provider be
permitted to adjust or settle any Claim without the consent of the Indemnified
Person to the extent any such adjustment or settlement involves, or is
reasonably likely to involve, any performance by or adverse admission by or with
respect to the Indemnified Person.

     In the event that the Indemnity Provider shall be required to make any
payment under this Section 11.1 to an Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person
agrees to take such reasonable action as is requested by the Indemnity Provider,
in writing, any such action to be at the risk and expense of the Indemnity
Provider, to minimize the consequences of the After-Tax Basis method of the
indemnity.

     11.2.  General Tax Indemnity.
            ---------------------

            (a)  Subject to and limited by in all respects the provisions of
     this Section 11.2 and Sections 11.6 and 11.7, the Indemnity Provider shall
     pay and assume liability for, and does hereby agree to indemnify, protect
     and defend the Property and all Indemnified Persons, and hold them harmless
     against, (i) all Impositions on an After Tax Basis and (ii) taxes that are
     in the nature of gross income, privilege or doing business taxes (not
     included in the definition of Impositions) imposed to the extent related to
     the transactions contemplated hereby, the Lessor, and all payments pursuant
     to the Operative Agreements shall be made free and clear of and without
     deduction for any and all present and future Impositions. In the event that
     the Indemnity Provider shall be required to make any

                                       53

<PAGE>

     payment under this Section 11.2(a) to an Indemnified Person, the
     Indemnified Person agrees to take such reasonable action as is requested by
     the Indemnity Provider, in writing, any such action to be at the risk and
     expense of the Indemnity Provider, to minimize the consequences of the
     After-Tax Basis method of the indemnity.

            (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 11.2(a)
     hereof, the following shall be excluded from the indemnity required by
     Section 11.2(a) (collectively, the "Excluded Taxes"):

                 (i)   Taxes (other than Taxes that are, or are in the nature
            of, sales, use, rental, value added, ad valorem, transfer or
            property taxes) that are imposed on any Indemnified Person (other
            than the Lessor) by the United States federal government that are
            based on or measured by the net income (including without limitation
            taxes based on capital gains and minimum taxes) of such Person;
            provided, that this clause (i) shall not be interpreted to prevent a
            payment from being made on an After Tax Basis if such payment is
            otherwise required to be so made;

                 (ii)  Taxes (other than Taxes that are, or are in the nature
            of, sales, use, rental, value added, ad valorem, transfer or
            property taxes) that are imposed on any Indemnified Person (other
            than the Lessor) by any state or local jurisdiction or taxing
            authority within any state or local jurisdiction and that are based
            upon or measured by the net income (including without limitation
            taxes based on capital gains and minimum taxes) of such Person;
            provided that such Taxes shall not be excluded under this
            subparagraph (ii) to the extent such Taxes would have been imposed
            had the location, possession or use of the Property in, the location
            or the operation of the Lessee in, or the Lessee's making payments
            under the Operative Agreements from, the jurisdiction imposing such
            Taxes been the sole connection between such Indemnified Person and
            the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes; provided, further, that this
            clause (ii) shall not be interpreted to prevent a payment from being
            made on an After Tax Basis if such payment is otherwise required to
            be so made;

                 (iii) any Tax to the extent it relates to any act, event or
            omission that occurs after the termination of the Lease and
            redelivery or sale of the Property in accordance with the terms of
            the Lease (but not any Tax that relates to such termination,
            redelivery or sale and/or to any period prior to such termination,
            redelivery or sale); and

                 (iv)  any Taxes which are imposed on an Indemnified Person as a
            result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
            Indemnified Person itself, as determined by a court of competent
            jurisdiction (as opposed to gross negligence or willful misconduct
            imputed to such Indemnified Person), but not Taxes imposed as a
            result of ordinary negligence of such Indemnified Person.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusions from the definition of
     "Impositions" set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not apply (but
     the other exclusions shall apply) to any Taxes or increase in Taxes imposed
     on an Indemnified Person net of

                                       54

<PAGE>

     any decrease in Taxes realized by such Indemnified Person, to the extent
     that such tax increase or decrease would not have occurred if on the
     Closing Date the Primary Financing Parties had advanced funds to the Lessee
     in the form of a loan secured by the Property in an amount equal to the
     Advances funded on such date, with debt service equal to the Basic Rent
     payable on each Schedule Interest Payment Date and a principal balance at
     the maturity of such loan in an amount equal to the then outstanding amount
     of the Notes and the Lessor Advance at the end of the term of the Lease.

            (c)  (i)   Subject to the terms of Section 11.2(f), the Indemnity
            Provider shall pay or cause to be paid in a timely manner all
            Impositions directly to the taxing authorities where feasible and
            otherwise to the Indemnified Person, as appropriate, and the
            Indemnity Provider shall at its own expense, upon such Indemnified
            Person's reasonable request, furnish to such Indemnified Person
            copies of official receipts or other satisfactory proof evidencing
            such payment.

                 (ii)  In the case of Impositions for which no contest is
            conducted pursuant to Section 11.2(f) and which the Indemnity
            Provider pays directly to the taxing authorities, the Indemnity
            Provider shall pay such Impositions prior to the latest time
            permitted by the relevant taxing authority for timely payment. In
            the case of Impositions for which the Indemnity Provider reimburses
            an Indemnified Person, the Indemnity Provider shall do so within
            thirty (30) days by the Indemnity Provider of demand by such
            Indemnified Person after receipt describing in reasonable detail the
            nature of the Imposition and the basis for the demand (including
            without limitation the computation of the amount payable),
            accompanied by receipts or other reasonable evidence of such demand.
            In the case of Impositions for which a contest is conducted pursuant
            to Section 11.2(f), the Indemnity Provider shall pay such
            Impositions or reimburse such Indemnified Person for such
            Impositions, to the extent not previously paid or reimbursed
            pursuant to subsection (a), prior to the latest time permitted by
            the relevant taxing authority for timely payment after conclusion of
            all contests under Section 11.2(f).

                 (iii) At the Indemnity Provider's request, the amount of any
            indemnification payment by the Indemnity Provider pursuant to
            subsection (a) shall be verified and certified by an independent
            public accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Indemnity Provider
            and the Indemnified Person. The fees and expenses of such
            independent public accounting firm shall be paid by the Indemnity
            Provider unless such verification shall result in an adjustment in
            the Indemnity Provider's favor of five percent (5%) or more of the
            payment as computed by the Indemnified Person, in which case such
            fee shall be paid by the Indemnified Person.

            (d)  The Indemnity Provider shall be responsible for preparing
     and filing any real and personal property or ad valorem tax returns in
     respect of the Property. In case any other report or tax return shall be
     required to be made with respect to any obligations of the Indemnity
     Provider under or arising out of subsection (a) and of which the Indemnity
     Provider has knowledge or should have knowledge, the Indemnity Provider, at
     its sole cost and expense, shall notify the relevant Indemnified Person of
     such

                                       55

<PAGE>

     requirement and (except if such Indemnified Person notifies the Indemnity
     Provider that such Indemnified Person intends to prepare and file such
     report or return) (A) to the extent required or permitted by and consistent
     with Legal Requirements, make and file in the Indemnity Provider's name
     such return, statement or report; and (B) in the case of any other such
     return, statement or report required to be made in the name of such
     Indemnified Person, advise such Indemnified Person of such fact and prepare
     such return, statement or report for filing by such Indemnified Person or,
     where such return, statement or report shall be required to reflect items
     in addition to any obligations of the Indemnity Provider under or arising
     out of subsection (a), provide such Indemnified Person at the Indemnity
     Provider's expense with information sufficient to permit such return,
     statement or report to be properly made with respect to any obligations of
     the Indemnity Provider under or arising out of subsection (a) no later than
     fifteen (15) days prior to the due date thereof. Such Indemnified Person
     shall, upon the Indemnity Provider's request and at the Indemnity
     Provider's expense, provide any data maintained by such Indemnified Person
     (and not otherwise available to or within the control of the Indemnity
     Provider) with respect to the Property which the Indemnity Provider may
     reasonably require to prepare any required tax returns or reports. If an
     Indemnified Person or an Affiliate receives notification from a taxing
     authority having jurisdiction over the Indemnified Person or the Property
     that an Imposition has been or will be imposed or a filing is required in
     connection therewith for which indemnification is required to be provided
     by the Indemnity Provider hereunder, then such Indemnified Person shall
     provide prompt written notice thereof to the Indemnity Provider; provided,
     however, the failure of the Indemnified Person to provide any such notice
     shall not relieve the Indemnity Provider of its obligations hereunder
     except to the extent that the failure by the Indemnified Person to provide
     such notice actually and materially expands the obligations (including any
     increase in the amount of any indemnity) of the Indemnity Provider
     hereunder.

            If an Indemnified Person or an Affiliate with whom such Indemnified
     Person files a consolidated tax return, or equivalent, subsequently
     receives the refund of an amount that such Indemnified Person determines in
     its sole discretion to be indemnified hereunder, then, so long as no Event
     of Default shall exist and be continuing, such Indemnified Person shall pay
     the amount of such refund, together with the amount of interest actually
     received thereon, if any, to the Indemnity Provider; provided, however, if
     any refund or other amount shall ever be subject to reclaim or otherwise be
     required to be returned or repaid to the applicable taxing authority that
     issued such refund, then the amount subject to the reclaim or otherwise
     required to be repaid to such tax authority shall be deemed to be an
     Imposition for which Indemnity Provider shall be responsible to indemnify
     and hold harmless such Indemnified Person.

            (e)  As between the Indemnity Provider on one hand, and each
     Financing Party on the other hand, the Indemnity Provider shall be
     responsible for, and the Indemnity Provider shall indemnify and hold
     harmless each Financing Party (without duplication of any indemnification
     required by subsection (a)) on an After Tax Basis against, any obligation
     for United States or foreign withholding taxes or similar levies, imposts,
     charges, fees, deductions or withholdings (collectively, "Withholdings")
     imposed in respect of the interest payable on the Credit Notes or the
     Mortgage Loans or Lessor Yield payable on the Lessor Advance or with
     respect to any other payments under the Operative Agreements (all such
     payments being referred to herein as "Exempt Payments"

                                       56

<PAGE>

     to be made without deduction, withholding or set off) (and, if any
     Financing Party receives a demand for such payment from any taxing
     authority or a Withholding is otherwise required with respect to any Exempt
     Payment, the Indemnity Provider shall discharge such demand on behalf of
     such Financing Party); provided, however, that the obligation of the
     Indemnity Provider under this Section 11.2(e) shall not apply to:

                 (i)  Withholdings on any Exempt Payment to any Financing Party
            which is a non-U.S. Person unless such Financing Party is, on the
            date hereof (or on the date it becomes a Financing Party hereunder)
            and on the date of any change in the principal place of business or
            the lending office of such Financing Party, entitled to submit a
            Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI or successor applicable form, certifying
            in each case that such party is entitled under Section 1441 or 1442
            of the Code or any other applicable provision thereof or under any
            applicable tax treaty or convention to receive payments pursuant to
            the Operative Agreements without deduction or withholding of United
            States federal income tax and is a foreign Person thereby entitled
            to an exemption from United States backup withholding taxes (except
            where the failure of the exemption results from a change in the
            principal place of business of the Lessee); provided, however, if a
            failure of the exemption is due to a change in law after the date
            hereof or in the case of a Financing Party that acquires its
            interest after the date hereof, a change in law occurring after such
            date, then the Indemnity Provider shall be liable for any
            withholding resulting therefrom; or

                 (ii) Any U.S. Taxes imposed solely by reason of the failure by
            a non-U.S. Person to comply with applicable certification,
            information, documentation or other reporting requirements
            concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connections with
            the United States of America of such non-U.S. Person if such
            compliance is required by statute or regulation of the United States
            of America as a precondition to relief or exemption from such U.S.
            Taxes if the Indemnity Provider has provided such certification,
            information, documentation or other reporting requirements to the
            Financing Party on a timely basis and the Financing Party is
            eligible for such relief or exemption.

     For the purposes of this Section 11.2(e), (A) "U.S. Person" shall mean a
     citizen, national or resident of the United States of America, a
     corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under
     any laws of the United States of America or any State thereof, or any
     estate or trust that is subject to Federal income taxation regardless of
     the source of its income, (B) "U.S. Taxes" shall mean any present or future
     tax, assessment or other charge or levy imposed by or on behalf of the
     United States of America or any taxing authority thereof or therein, (C)
     "Form W-8BEN" shall mean Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of
     Beneficial Owner for United States Withholding) of the Department of the
     Treasury of the United States of America and (D) "Form W-8ECI" shall mean
     Form W-8ECI (Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim for Exemption from
     Withholding on Income Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or
     Business in the United States) of the Department of the Treasury of the
     United States of America (or in relation to either such Form such successor
     and related forms as may from time to time be adopted by the relevant
     taxing authorities of the United States of America to document a claim to
     which such Form relates). Each of the Forms referred to in the

                                       57

<PAGE>

     foregoing clauses (C) and (D) shall include such successor and related
     forms as may from time to time be adopted by the relevant taxing
     authorities of the United States of America to document a claim to which
     such Form relates.

            If a Financing Party or an Affiliate with whom such Financing Party
     files a consolidated tax return (or equivalent) subsequently receives the
     benefit in any country of a tax credit or an allowance resulting from U.S.
     Taxes with respect to which it has received a payment of an additional
     amount under this Section 11.2(e), such Financing Party will pay to the
     Indemnity Provider such part of that benefit as in the opinion of such
     Financing Party will leave it (after such payment) in a position no more
     and no less favorable than it would have been in if no additional payment
     had been required to be paid, provided always that (i) such Financing Party
     will be the sole judge of the amount of any such benefit and of the date on
     which it is received, (ii) such Financing Party will have the absolute
     discretion as to the order and manner in which it employs or claims tax
     credits and allowances available to it and (iii) such Financing Party will
     not be obliged to disclose to the Borrower any information regarding its
     tax affairs or tax computations. A subsequent loss of such tax credit or
     allowance with respect to which a payment is made pursuant to this
     paragraph to an Indemnity Provider shall be treated as an Imposition that
     is indemnifiable under Section 11.2(a) hereof without regard to the
     exclusions of Section 11.2(b)(i), (ii), and (iii) hereof.

            Each non-U.S. Person that shall become a Financing Party after the
     date hereof shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer or
     otherwise upon becoming a Financing Party hereunder, be required to provide
     all of the forms and statements referenced above or other evidences of
     exemption from Withholdings if the Indemnity Provider has provided such
     certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements
     to the Financing Party and the Financing Party is eligible for such relief
     or exemption.

            (f)  If a written Claim is made against any Indemnified Person or if
     any proceeding shall be commenced against such Indemnified Person
     (including without limitation a written notice of such proceeding), for any
     Impositions, the provisions in Section 11.1 relating to notification and
     rights to contest shall apply; provided, however, that the Indemnity
     Provider shall have the right to conduct and control such contest only if
     such contest involves a Tax other than a Tax on net income of the
     Indemnified Person that can be pursued independently from any other
     proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Indemnified Person and the
     Indemnity Provider agrees to pay to such Indemnified Person on demand the
     Impositions which are the subject of such claim to the extent the contest
     is unsuccessful. The controlling party shall provide the non-controlling
     party with a copy of (or appropriate excerpts from) any reports or claims
     issued by the relevant auditing agents or taxing authority to the
     controlling party thereof, in connection with such claim or the contest
     thereof.

     11.3.  Increased Costs, Illegality, etc.
            --------------------------------

     Subject to and limited by in all respects the provisions of this Section
11.3 and Sections 11.6 and 11.7:

            (a)  (i)    If any change in Law shall:

                        (A)  impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
                 special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
                 deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any
                 Financing Party (except any such reserve requirement reflected
                 in the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Percentage); or

                        (B)  impose on any Financing Party or the London
                 interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement
                 or any other Operative Agreement or any Financing made by such
                 Financing Party;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Financing Party of making or maintaining any Financing (or of maintaining its
obligation to purchase any Credit Note, make its Mortgage Loan or make its
Lessor Advance ) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Financing Party hereunder or pursuant to any other Operative Agreement
(whether of principal, interest, Lessor Yield or otherwise), then the Lessee
will pay or cause to be paid to such Financing Party such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Financing Party for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

                 (ii)   If any Financing Party determines that any change in Law
            regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
            reducing the rate of return on such Financing Party's capital or on
            the capital of such Financing Party's holding company, if any, as a
            consequence of this Agreement or any other Operative Agreement or
            the Credit Notes purchased, the Mortgage Loans made, or Lessor
            Advance made, by such Financing Party to a level below that which
            such Financing Party or such Financing Party's holding company could
            have achieved but for such change in Law (taking into consideration
            such Financing Party's policies and the policies of such Financing
            Party's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from
            time to time the Lessee will pay or cause to be paid to such
            Financing Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
            such Financing Party or such Financing Party's holding company for
            any such reduction suffered.

                 (iii)  A certificate of a Financing Party setting forth in
            reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
            Financing Party or its holding company, as the case may be, as
            specified in paragraphs (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of this Section 11.3 shall
            be delivered to the Lessee and shall be conclusive absent manifest
            error. The Lessee shall pay or cause to be paid to such Financing
            Party the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten
            (10) days after receipt thereof.

                                       59

<PAGE>

                 (iv)   Failure or delay on the part of any Financing Party to
            demand compensation pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall not
            constitute a waiver of such Financing Party's right to demand such
            compensation; provided, that the Lessee shall not be required to
            compensate or cause to be compensated a Financing Party pursuant to
            this Section 11.3 for any increased costs or reductions incurred
            more than 270 days prior to the date that such Financing Party
            notifies the Lessee of the change in Law giving rise to such
            increased costs or reductions and of such Financing Party's
            intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that,
            if the change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
            reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above
            shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
            thereof.

            (b)  If any Financing Party determines that compliance with any
     change in law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central
     bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of
     law, but in each case promulgated or made after the date hereof) affects or
     would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
     such Financing Party or any corporation controlling such Financing Party
     and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the
     existence of such Financing Party's commitment to make its portion of the
     Advance and other commitments of this type or upon the Advance, then, upon
     demand by such Financing Party (with a copy of such demand to the Agent),
     the Lessee shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Financing Party,
     from time to time as specified by such Financing Party, additional amounts
     sufficient to compensate such Financing Party or such corporation in the
     light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Financing Party
     reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the
     existence of such Financing Party's commitment to make its portion of the
     Advance. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Lessee and the
     Agent by such Financing Party shall be conclusive and binding for all
     purposes, absent manifest error.

            (c)  [Reserved].

            (d)  Without affecting its rights under Sections 11.3(a), 11.3(b) or
     11.3(c) or any other provision of any Operative Agreement, each Financing
     Party agrees that if there is any increase in any cost to or reduction in
     any amount receivable by such Financing Party with respect to which the
     Lessee would be obligated to compensate such Financing Party pursuant to
     Sections 11.3(a) or 11.3(b), such Financing Party shall use reasonable
     efforts to select an alternative office for its portion of the Advance
     which would not result in any such increase in any cost to or reduction in
     any amount receivable by such Financing Party; provided, however, that no
     Financing Party shall be obligated to select an alternative office for
     Advances if such Financing Party determines that (i) as a result of such
     selection such Financing Party would be in violation of any applicable law,
     regulation, treaty, or guideline, or would incur additional costs or
     expenses or (ii) such selection would be inadvisable for regulatory reasons
     or materially inconsistent with the interests of such Financing Party.

            (e)  With reference to the obligations of the Lessee set forth in
     Sections 11.3(a) through 11.3(d), the Lessee shall not have any obligation
     to pay to any Financing

                                       60

<PAGE>

     Party amounts owing under such Sections for any period which is more than
     one (1) year prior to the date upon which the request for payment therefor
     is delivered to the Lessee.

            (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any
     Financing Party shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any
     change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it
     unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that
     it is unlawful, for any Financing Party to perform its obligations
     hereunder to purchase, make or maintain any Eurodollar Financing, then (i)
     each such Eurodollar Financing will automatically, at the earlier of the
     end of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Financing or the date
     required by law, convert into an ABR Financing, and (iii) the obligation of
     the Financing Parties to purchase, make, convert or continue any Eurodollar
     Financing shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Lessee that
     such Financing Party has determined that the circumstances causing such
     suspension no longer exist.

     11.4.  Funding/Contribution Indemnity.
            ------------------------------

     Subject to and limited by in all respects the provisions of this Section
11.4 and Sections 11.6 and 11.7, the Lessee agrees to indemnify each Financing
Party and to hold each Financing Party harmless from any loss or reasonable
expense which such Financing Party may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a)
any default in connection with the drawing of funds for any Advance, (b) any
default in making any prepayment after a notice thereof has been given in
accordance with the provisions of the Operative Agreements or (c) the making of
a voluntary or involuntary prepayment of Eurodollar Financings on a day which is
not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such
indemnification shall be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the
amount of interest or Lessor Yield, as the case may be, which would have accrued
on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, accepted, converted or continued
for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow,
accept, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the
case of a failure to borrow, accept, convert or continue, the Interest Period
that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the
applicable Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Percentage for such Eurodollar
Financing for such Interest Period over (y) the amount of interest (as
determined by such Financing Party in its reasonable discretion) which would
have accrued to such Financing Party on such amount by (I) (in the case of the
Lessor or any Mortgage Lender) reemploying such funds in loans of the same type
and amount during the period from the date of prepayment or failure to borrow to
the last day of the then applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a
failure to borrow, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of
such failure) and (II) respecting the Credit Notes, the Make-Whole Amount. This
covenant shall survive the termination of the Operative Agreements and the
payment of all other amounts payable hereunder.

LIABILITY OF ANY SUCH BENEFICIARY.

times have the rights and benefits, and the Indemnity Provider shall have the
obligations, in each case provided pursuant to the Operative Agreements with
respect to Environmental Matters (including without limitation the rights and
benefits provided pursuant to Section 11.1(c)).

     11.7.  Cooperation with the Indemnity Provider.
            ---------------------------------------

     Each Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in a reasonable manner (but at
the expense of the Indemnity Provider) with the Indemnity Provider in responding
to any Claim covered by the indemnities referenced in the Operative Agreements.

     11.8.  Time Period in which Claims may arise and be Covered by

            ---------------

     The basis for any Claim which is subject to indemnification coverage by the
Indemnity Provider pursuant to Sections 11.1 through 11.6 must occur or arise on
or before the date on which all of the Notes and the Lessor Advance and all
other amounts owing to any Financing Party by the Lessee are paid in full,

     12.4.  Terminations, Amendments, Waivers, Etc.; Unanimous Vote Matters.
            ---------------------------------------------------------------

     Each of the parties hereto agrees that:

            (a)  except as expressly provided in subsections (b) and (c) below
     and except for the Unanimous Vote Matters, each Operative Agreement may
     only be terminated, amended, modified, extended supplemented, restated,
     replaced or waived upon the approval in writing by the Borrower (to the
     extent the Borrower is a party to such Operative Agreement in its capacity
     as "borrower" or "issuer" under the Note Purchase Agreement and to the
     extent such termination, amendment, waiver or modification increases the
     Obligations or has a material adverse effect on the Borrower), the Agent
     (to the extent the Agent's rights or obligations are affected by such
     termination, amendment or modification), the Majority Secured Parties and

     Agreement); provided, each termination, amendment, modification, extension,
     supplement, restatement, replacement or waiver regarding any Operative
     Agreement, which adversely affects the rights of the Lessee shall also
     require the written consent of the Lessee (not to be unreasonably withheld
     or delayed) unless a Lease Default or Lease Event of Default shall have
     occurred and be continuing, provided, further, that each termination,
     amendment, modification, extension, supplement, restatement, replacement or
     waiver regarding any Operative Agreement shall also require the written
     consent of each Financing Party affected thereby (the "Unanimous Vote
     Matters"), so as to

                 (i)    extend the scheduled date of maturity of any Note;

                 (ii)   extend the scheduled Expiration Date or extend any
            payment date of any Credit Note, Mortgage Loan or Lessor Advance;

                 (iii)  change the stated rate of interest payable on any Credit
            Note or Mortgage Loan or reduce the stated Lessor Yield payable on
            the Lessor Advance (other than as a result of waiving the
            applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates or
            Lessor Yield);

                 (iv)   modify the priority of any Lien in favor of the Agent
            under any Security Document;

                 (v)    subordinate any obligation owed to such Credit Note
            Purchaser, such Mortgage Lender or the Lessor;

                 (vi)   terminate, amend, supplement, waive, discharge or modify
            any provision of this Section 12.4 or change the percentages
            specified in the definitions of Majority Credit Note Purchasers,
            Majority Mortgage Lenders or Majority Secured Parties;

                 (vii)  release a material portion of the Collateral (except in
            accordance with Section 8.8);

                                       66

<PAGE>

                 (viii) release the Borrower or the Lessee or any Guarantor from
            its obligations under any Operative Agreement or otherwise alter any
            payment obligations (including, without limitation, the Make-Whole
            Amount and any principal prepayment provisions) of the Borrower or
            the Lessee or any Guarantor to the Lessor or any Financing Party
            under the Operative Agreements;

                 (ix)   terminate, amend, supplement, waive, discharge or modify
            any provision of Sections 8.6 or 8.7 of this Agreement;

                 (x)    impose any additional affirmative obligation or
            requirement on the applicable Financing Party, make any existing
            obligations of the applicable Financing Party materially more
            onerous, or further obligate, prohibit or restrict the applicable
            Financing Party or its right, title or interest under the
            Operative Agreements in any material manner; or

                 (xi)   modify or amend any definition so as to affect the
            matters described in the foregoing (i)-(x).

            (b)  No Mortgage Instrument (nor any UCC Financing Statement related
     thereto) may be terminated, amended, modified, extended (other than by UCC
     Financing Statement continuations or extensions), supplemented, restated,
     replaced or waived without the approval in writing by the Borrower, the
     Majority Mortgage Lenders, and (to the extent relating to the Lessee as
     opposed to relating to the Borrower) the Lessee.

            (c)  each termination, amendment, modification, extension,
     supplement, restatement, replacement or waiver regarding any Operative
     Agreement affecting Sections 4.1, 8.2, 8.3, 9.1, 10.1, 10.2, 11.1, 12.1,
     13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 16.1, 16.2, 18.1, 19.1,
     19.2, 20.2, 20.3 (excluding all provisions related to payments in Sections
     20.2 or 20.3), 22.1, 22.4, 22.5, 23.1 or 24.1 of the Lease or affecting in
     any way the Collateral, including the Property, requires the consent of the
     Majority Mortgage Lenders.

            (d)  Notwithstanding any acquisition by the Lessee or any Affiliate
     of the Lessee of any interest in any Financing, no such party (hereinafter
     a "Related Financing Party") shall have any voting rights pursuant to the
     Operative Agreements as a Primary Financing Party. Without limiting the
     generality of the foregoing, with respect to calculating the voting
     percentage, any Financing held by a Related Financing Party shall be
     treated as if the balance on such Financing was zero.

            Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Lease Default
     or Lease Event of Default, the rights of each Related Financing Party to
     any and all amounts otherwise payable to such Related Financing Party
     pursuant to the Operative Agreements shall be subordinated and deferred
     (and the rights of each Related Financing Party to such amounts shall be
     voided without further action for the duration of any such Lease Default or
     Lease Event of Default) until such time as all amounts payable to all other
     parties to any of the Operative Agreements have been paid in full.

     LESSEE TO ACQUIRE ANY PORTION OF THE FINANCING OR TO CAUSE ANY PRIMARY
     FINANCING PARTY TO SELL OR ASSIGN ANY PART OF THE FINANCING TO THE LESSEE
     OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE LESSEE.

     Any such termination, amendment, supplement, waiver, discharge or
modification approved, executed, adopted or consented to in conformity with this
Section 12.4 shall apply equally to each of the Credit Note Purchasers, the
Mortgage Lenders and the Lessor and shall be binding upon all the parties to
this Agreement. In the case of any waiver, each party to this Agreement shall be
restored to its former position and rights under the Operative Agreements, and
any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default
or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

     (b)    EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER OPERATIVE AGREEMENT
AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

     (c)    Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waives any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of
the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Operative Agreement brought in the courts referred to in
subsection (a) above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in

parties shall have the right to proceed in any court of proper jurisdiction or

            ------------

     Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of

jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

     12.9.  Liability Limited.
            -----------------

     Anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Note Purchase
Agreement, Mortgage Note Loan Agreement, the Notes or in any other Operative

Operative Agreement including without limitation the payment of the principal
of, or interest on, the Notes, or for monetary damages for the breach of
performance of any of the covenants contained in the Note Purchase Agreement,
Mortgage Note Loan Agreement, the Notes, this Agreement or any of the other
Operative Agreements. The Financing Parties agree that, in the event any
remedies under any Operative Agreement are pursued, neither the Primary
Financing Parties nor the Agent shall have any recourse against any

                                       69

<PAGE>

Exculpated Person, for any deficiency, loss or Claim for monetary damages or
otherwise resulting therefrom and recourse shall be had solely and exclusively
against the Borrower's Interest (excluding Excepted Payments) and the Credit
Parties (with respect to the Credit Parties' obligations under the Operative
Agreements); but nothing contained herein shall be taken to prevent recourse
against or the enforcement of remedies against the Borrower's Interest
(excluding Excepted Payments) in respect of any and all liabilities, obligations
and undertakings contained herein and/or in any other Operative Agreement.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, nothing in any Operative
Agreement shall: (i) constitute a waiver, release or discharge of any
indebtedness or obligation evidenced by the Notes arising under any Operative
Agreement or secured by any Operative Agreement, but the same shall continue
until paid or discharged; (ii) relieve any Exculpated Person from liability and
responsibility for (but only to the extent of the damages arising by reason of):
active waste knowingly committed by any Exculpated Person with respect to the
Property, any fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any
Exculpated Person; (iii) relieve any Exculpated Person from liability and
responsibility for (but only to the extent of the moneys misappropriated,
misapplied or not turned over) (A) except for Excepted Payments,
misappropriation or misapplication by the Lessor (i.e., application in a manner
contrary to any of the Operative Agreements) of any insurance proceeds or
condemnation award paid or delivered to the Lessor by any Person other than the
Agent, (B) except for Excepted Payments, any deposits or any escrows or amounts
held by the Lessor or (C) except for Excepted Payments, any rent or other income
or funds received by the Lessor from the Lessee that are not turned over to the
Agent; (iv) affect or in any way limit the Agent's rights and remedies under any
Operative Agreement with respect to the Rents and rights and powers of the Agent
under the Operative Agreements or to obtain a judgment against the Lessee's
interest in the Property or the Agent's rights and powers to obtain a judgment
against the Lessor or the Lessee; or (v) relieve any Exculpated Person from
liability and responsibility (A) with respect to such Person's obligations
concerning Lessor Liens pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and the last sentence of
Section 8.9(a) hereof or (B) to the extent such liability or responsibility is
attributable to any representation or warranty of any Exculpated Person
contained in Section 6.1 hereof that was false or inaccurate in any material way
when made (provided, that no deficiency judgment or other money judgment shall
be enforced against any Exculpated Person except to the extent of the Borrower's
Interest (excluding Excepted Payments) or to the extent the Lessor may be liable
as otherwise contemplated in clauses (ii), (iii) or (v) of this Section
12.9(b)).

     12.10. Rights of the Credit Parties.
            ----------------------------

     If at any time all obligations (i) of the Borrower under the Note Purchase
Agreement, the Mortgage Note Loan Agreement, the Security Documents and the
other Operative Agreements and (ii) of the Credit Parties under the Operative
Agreements have in each case been satisfied or discharged in full, then the
Credit Parties shall be entitled to (a) terminate the Lease and guaranty
obligations under Section 6B and the Structural Guaranty and (b) receive all
amounts then held under the Operative Agreements and all proceeds with respect
to the Property. Upon the termination of the Lease and Section 6B pursuant to
the foregoing clause (a), the Lessor shall transfer to the Lessee all of its
right, title and interest free and clear of the Lien of the Lease, the Lien of
the Security Documents and all Lessor Liens in and to the Property and any
amounts or proceeds referred to in the foregoing clause (b) shall be paid over
to the Lessee.

     12.11. Further Assurances.
            ------------------

     The parties hereto shall promptly cause to be taken, executed, acknowledged
or delivered, at the sole expense of the Lessee, all such further acts,
conveyances, documents and assurances as the other parties may from time to time
reasonably request in order to carry out and effectuate the intent and purposes
of this Participation Agreement, the other Operative Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including without limitation the
preparation, execution and filing of any and all Uniform Commercial Code
financing statements, filings of Mortgage Instruments and other filings or
registrations which the parties hereto may from time to time request to be filed
or effected). The Lessee, at its own expense and without need of any prior
request from any other party, shall take such action as may be necessary
(including without limitation any action specified in the preceding sentence),
or (if the Lessor or the Agent shall so request) as so requested, in order to
maintain and protect all security interests provided for hereunder or under any
other Operative Agreement. In addition, in connection with the sale or other
disposition of the Property or any portion thereof, the Lessee and Lessor agree
to execute such instruments of conveyance as may be reasonably required in
connection therewith.

     12.12. Calculations under Operative Agreements; Consents.
            -------------------------------------------------

     (a)    The parties hereto agree that all calculations and numerical
determinations to be made under the Operative Agreements by the Lessor shall be
made by the Agent and that such calculations and determinations shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties hereto in the absence of manifest error;
provided, however, the Agent shall furnish (with any out-of-pocket cost or
expense incurred by the Agent to be paid by the Lessee) the Lessee, at any
Credit Party's request, with reasonable documentation and information which
substantiates all such calculations and numerical determinations in order to
satisfy that the same are correct.

     (b)    The parties hereby agree that a Financing Party shall be deemed to
have acted reasonably and shall have exercised reasonable discretion in the
event and to the extent such Financing Party has withheld its consent to or
refused to approve any requested action, amendment, supplement, modification,
approval or similar matter based on a reasonable belief that the requested
action, amendment, supplement, modification, approval or similar matter will
adversely affect the rating from any Rating Agency of such Financing Party's
Notes or Lessor Advance.

     12.13. Confidentiality.
            ---------------
     (a)    Each Financing Party agrees to keep confidential any information
furnished or made available to it by any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Agreement that is marked confidential; provided that nothing
herein shall prevent any Financing Party from disclosing such information (a) to
any other Financing Party or any Affiliate of any Financing Party, or any
officer, director, employee, agent, or advisor of any Financing Party or
Affiliate of any Financing Party, (b) to any other Person if reasonably
incidental to the administration of the credit facility provided herein, (c) as
required by any law, rule, or regulation, (d) upon the order of any court or
administrative agency, (e) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency
or authority having jurisdiction over any such Person (including, but not
limited to, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (f) that is or
becomes available to the public or that is

                                       71

<PAGE>

or becomes available to any Financing Party other than as a result of a
disclosure by any Financing Party prohibited by this Agreement, (g) in
connection with any litigation to which such Financing Party or any of its
Affiliates may be a party, (h) to the extent necessary in connection with the
exercise of any remedy under this Agreement or any other Operative Agreement,
(i) subject to provisions substantially similar to those contained in this
Section, to any actual or proposed participant or assignee, and (j) to any
Rating Agency. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, "information"
shall not include, and the Financing Parties may disclose without limitation of
any kind, any information with respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax
structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Operative
Agreements and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to such Financing Party relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure; provided that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information, this
sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that
relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Operative Agreements.

     (b)    Neither the Borrower nor the Lessee will publish or give to any
creditor or prospective creditor of the Borrower or the Lessee any copy,
statement or summary (or acquiesce in the publication or giving of any such
copy, statement or summary) as to the subordination of the rights of the Credit
Note Purchasers under the Intercreditor Agreement or otherwise without also
stating or causing to be stated (in a conspicuous manner in the case of any
document) that such subordination is solely for the benefit of the purchasers of
Mortgage Obligations, and is not for the benefit of any other creditor of the
Borrower or the Lessee.

     12.14. Financial Reporting/Tax Characterization.
            ----------------------------------------

     Lessee agrees to obtain advice from its own accountants and tax counsel
regarding the financial reporting treatment and the tax characterization of the
transactions described in the Operative Agreements. Lessee further agrees that
Lessee shall not rely upon any statement of any Financing Party or any of their
respective Affiliates and/or Subsidiaries regarding any such financial reporting
treatment and/or tax characterization.

     12.15. Set-off.
            -------

     In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable Law and
not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon and after the occurrence of
any Event of Default and during the continuance thereof, the Credit Note
Purchasers, the Mortgage Lenders, the Lessor, their respective Affiliates and
any assignee or participant of a Credit Note Purchaser, a Mortgage Lender or the
Lessor in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Operative Agreements
are hereby authorized by the Credit Parties at any time or from time to time,
without notice to the Credit Parties or to any other Person, any such notice
being hereby expressly waived, to set-off and to appropriate and to apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, including without
limitation indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or
unmatured) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by the Credit
Note Purchasers, the Mortgage Lenders, the Lessor, their respective Affiliates
or any assignee or participant of a Credit Note Purchaser, a Mortgage Lender or
the Lessor in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Operative
Agreements to or for the credit or the account of any

                                       72

<PAGE>

Credit Party against and on account of the obligations of any Credit Party under
the Operative Agreements irrespective of whether or not (a) the Credit Note
Purchasers, the Mortgage Lenders, or the Lessor shall have made any demand under
any Operative Agreement or (b) the Agent shall have declared any or all of the
obligations of any Credit Party under the Operative Agreements to be due and
payable and although such obligations shall be contingent or unmatured.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Agent nor any other Financing Party
shall exercise, or attempt to exercise, any right of setoff, banker's lien, or
the like, against any deposit account or property of any Credit Party held by
the Agent or any other Financing Party, without the prior written consent of the
Agent (acting upon the direction of the Secured Parties in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement), and any Financing Party violating this provision shall
indemnify the Agent and the other Financing Parties from any and all costs,
expenses, liabilities and damages resulting therefrom. The contractual
restriction on the exercise of setoff rights provided in the foregoing sentence
is solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Financing Parties and may not be
enforced by the Lessee.
