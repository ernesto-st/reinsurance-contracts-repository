   3.    Costs of Review Team
         --------------------

         MRM will pay all reasonable fees and disbursements of the Review Team
         in carrying out the Appointment on the following conditions:

         (i)      The firm will be engaged on a retainer basis whereby MRM will
                  pay to it the sum of One Hundred and fifty-thousand Bermuda
                  Dollars (BD$150,000.00) prior to the commencement of the
                  Appointment. This will be held by the Firm on behalf of MRM
                  subject to MRM paying invoices of the Firm approved by the
                  Supervisor of Insurance within 7 days of receipt of approved
                  invoices. Should payment of such approved invoices not be
                  rendered within 7 days of receipt by MRM the Firm will be
                  entitled to draw the amount of the outstanding approved
                  invoices forthwith from said retainer.

         (ii)     The Firm will render invoices to the Supervisor of Insurance
                  at the end of each week with a summary of the work performed,
                  identity of the fee earner, dates of the work and details of
                  the disbursements.

         (iii)    The Supervisor of Insurance, upon approval of the invoice,
                  shall provide copies of those invoices submitted by the Firm
                  within 7 days of receipt (marked as approved) to the MRM
                  Contact for payment. Payment will be made by MRM within 7 days
                  of receipt of the approved invoice subject to the provisions
                  of paragraph (iv) below.

         (iv)     If MRM has any questions pertaining to the invoices submitted
                  it shall have the right to discuss these questions with the
                  Firm directly in an effort to resolve them. If no resolution
                  can be reached, MRM will submit its questions to the
                  Supervisor of Insurance for resolution with the Firm and will
                  agree to abide by the decision of the Supervisor of Insurance
                  regarding the ultimate liability under the invoice. MRM, the
                  Firm and the Supervisor of Insurance will resolve all such
                  questions within 7 days of a dispute arising pertaining to the
                  invoice and failure to do so shall entitle the Firm to draw
                  such payment against the retainer held by the Firm.

         (v)      On completion of the Appointment, as confirmed in writing by
                  the Supervisor of Insurance to MRM and the Firm, the Firm will
                  repay the balance of any retainer held by the Firm to MRM
