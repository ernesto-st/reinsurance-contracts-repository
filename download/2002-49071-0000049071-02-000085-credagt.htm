Upon such execution, from and after the date of such CAF Loan Assignment, the CAF Loan Assignee shall, to the extent of the assignment provided for in such CAF Loan Assignment, be deemed to have the same rights and benefits of payment and enforcement with respect to such CAF Loan and Individual CAF Loan Note and the same rights of offset pursuant to subsection 8.1 and under applicable law and obligation to share pursuant to subsection 10.7 as it would have had if it were a Bank hereunder; <U>provided</U> that unless such CAF Loan Assignment shall otherwise specify and a copy of such CAF Loan Assignment shall have been delivered to the Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register in accordance with subsection 10.6(f), the assignor thereunder shall act as collection agent for the CAF Loan Assignee thereunder, and the Agent shall pay all amounts received from the Company which are allocable to the assigned CAF Loan or Individual CAF Loan Note directly to such assignor without any further liability to such CAF Loan Assignee. A CAF Loan Assignee under a CAF Loan Assignment shall not, by virtue of such CAF Loan Assignment, become a party to this Agreement or have any rights to consent to or refrain from consenting to any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of this Agreement or any related document; <U>provided</U> that if a copy of such CAF Loan Assignment shall have been delivered to the Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register in accordance with subsection 10.6(f), neither the principal amount of, the interest rate on, nor the maturity date of any CAF Loan or Individual CAF Loan Note assigned to the CAF Loan Assignee thereunder will be modified without the written consent of such CAF Loan Assignee. If a CAF Loan Assignee has caused a CAF Loan Assignment to be recorded in the Register in accordance with subsection 10.6(f), such CAF Loan Assignee may thereafter, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, assign such Individual CAF Loan Note to any Bank, to any affiliate or subsidiary of such CAF Loan Assignee or to any other financial institution that has total assets in excess of $1,000,000,000 and that in the ordinary course of its business extends credit of the type evidenced by such Individual CAF Loan Note, and the foregoing provisions of this subsection 10.6(c) shall apply, <U>mutatis mutandis</U>, to any such assignment by a CAF Loan Assignee.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Bank other than a Conduit Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to any Bank or any Lender Affiliate thereof, and, with the consent of the Company (unless an Event of Default is continuing) and the Agent (which in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld) to one or more additional banks or financial institutions ("<U>Purchasing Banks</U>") all or any part of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement and the Notes pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by such Purchasing Bank, such transferor Bank and the Agent (and, in the case of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank or a Lender Affiliate, and subject to the other qualifiers above, by the Company); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that (i) the Commitments purchased by such Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank or a Lender Affiliate shall be equal to or greater than $5,000,000, (ii) the transferor Bank which has transferred less than all of its Loans and Commitments to any such Purchasing Bank shall retain a minimum Commitment, after giving effect to such sale, equal to or greater than $10,000,000 and (iii) any sale by a Bank of any portion of its Tranche B Commitment prior to the Transition Date must be accompanied by a simultaneous sale to such Purchasing Bank of such selling Bank's pro rata share of its commitment pursuant to and in accordance with subsection 4.5(a) of the Liquidity Facility Agreement and such Purchasing Bank shall be an Eligible Assignee (as defined in the Liquidity Facility Agreement). For purposes of the proviso contained in the previous sentence, the amounts described therein shall be aggregated in respect of each Bank and its Lender Affiliates, if any. Upon (i) such execution of such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (ii) delivery of an executed copy thereof to the Company and (iii) payment by such Purchasing Bank, such Purchasing Bank shall for all purposes be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto with the Commitment Percentage of the Commitments set forth in such Commitment Transfer Supplement. Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Bank and the resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Bank of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Bank under this Agreement and the Notes. Upon the consummation of any transfer to a Purchasing Bank, pursuant to this subsection 10.6(d), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the Company shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Bank and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchasing Bank, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their Commitment Percentages or, as appropriate, their outstanding Loans as adjusted pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign at any time to its designating Bank hereunder without the consent of the Company or the Agent any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder and pursuant to its designation agreement and without regard to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this subsection 10.6(d).</P>

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Company, the Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company or any Bank or CAF Loan Assignee at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its receipt of a CAF Loan Assignment executed by an assignor Bank and a CAF Loan Assignee, together with payment to the Agent of a registration and processing fee of $2,500, the Agent shall promptly accept such CAF Loan Assignment, record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the assignor Bank, the CAF Loan Assignee and the Company. Upon its receipt of a Commitment Transfer Supplement executed by a transferor Bank and a Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank or an affiliate thereof, by the Company and the Agent) together with payment to the Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500, the Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Commitment Transfer Supplement (ii) on the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Banks and the Company.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant, CAF Loan Assignee or Purchasing Bank (each, a "<U>Transferee</U>") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company which has been delivered to such Bank by the Company pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Bank by the Company in connection with such Bank's credit evaluation of the Company prior to entering into this Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;If, pursuant to this subsection 10.6, any interest in this Agreement or any Note is transferred to a Non-U.S. Bank, the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer to comply with the provisions of subsection 2.15.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that any Bank shall be a "Defaulting Replaced Bank" (as defined in subsection 4.5(b) of the Liquidity Facility Agreement or any successor provision thereof) and the Company has pursuant to such subsection 4.5(b) replaced any such Bank with increased commitments from other Banks or any Additional Bank(s) (as defined in such subsection 4.5(b)), such Defaulting Replaced Bank shall assign the portion of its Tranche B Commitments hereunder to each such other Bank or Additional Bank corresponding to the portion of the commitments transferred to such other Bank or Additional Bank pursuant to subsection 4.5(b) of the Liquidity Facility Agreement pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by such Defaulting Replaced Bank, the transferee Bank(s), the Agent and the Company.</P>

<P>Pricing will be determined based upon the lower of the ratings from S&amp;P or Moody's, but in the event the Company's ratings are more than one Level apart, the pricing will be determined by using the rating which is one Level above the lower rating; <U>provided</U>, that (i) if on any day the ratings from S&amp;P or Moody's are not at the same Level, then the Level applicable to the lower of such ratings shall be applicable for such day, (ii) if on any day the rating of only one of S&amp;P or Moody's is available, then the Level of such rating shall be applicable for such day and (iii) if on any day a rating is available from neither of S&amp;P or Moody's, then Level 5 shall be applicable for such day. Any change in the applicable Level resulting from a change in the rating of a S&amp;P or Moody's shall become effective on the date such change is publicly announced by S&amp;P or Moody's, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Loan outstanding after the Termination Date, the Applicable Margin for such Loan, for the period from the Termination Date until the date on which such Loan is paid in full, shall be the percentage per annum which is the sum of (i) the Applicable Margin determined pursuant to the pricing grid set forth above for the applicable rating Level, plus (ii) the facility fee percentage determined pursuant to the pricing grid set forth above for the applicable rating Level, plus (iii) 0.25%. </P></BODY>
