the event of any conflict between the main body of this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the provisions of the

of any of the provisions hereof. The word &#8220;includes&#8221; or &#8220;including&#8221; means &#8220;including, but not limited
to,&#8221; unless the context otherwise requires. The words &#8220;shall&#8221; and &#8220;will&#8221; are used interchangeably

specified. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language the Parties have chosen to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Party. A defined term has its defined meaning throughout
this Agreement and each Exhibit and Schedule to this Agreement, regardless of whether it appears before or after the place where
it is defined. The term &#8220;cost&#8221; includes expense, and the term &#8220;expense&#8221; includes cost. All references to
a specific time of day in this Agreement shall be based upon Pacific Standard Time or Pacific Daylight Time, as applicable, on
the date in question unless otherwise specified. The word &#8220;or&#8221; will have the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase

an act is to be done shall be calculated by excluding the day on which the time period commences and including the day on which

</FONT>Historically, financial statements have not been prepared for the Company as it has not operated as a separate, stand-alone
enterprise. The Unaudited Financial Statements have been prepared from the historical accounting records of the Company in anticipation
of a potential transaction to separate the Company from the other business activities of Seller and its other Affiliates as though
the Company and the Assets had been managed as a separate, stand-alone enterprise for all periods presented. As the Company and
the Assets have been historically managed and financed as part of a larger group, its accounts reflect certain charges for functions
provided by Seller and its Affiliates that have been identified as related party transactions. It is possible that the terms of
the related party transactions are not the same as the terms that might otherwise result from transactions between unrelated parties.
To Seller&#8217;s Knowledge, all adjustments have been reflected that are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements
for the Company for their respective dates. The allocations have been made on a reasonable basis and have been consistently applied
for each period presented. The Unaudited Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect the financial position, results of operations
or cash flows that the Company might have had in the past, or might have in the future, if it had existed as a separate, stand-alone
enterprise.</P>

add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter

has occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a breach or default under the Financing Commitments.
Buyer is not aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of Buyer relating to Buyer, in
any of the Financing Commitments, inaccurate in any material respect. Buyer believes that it will be able to satisfy on a timely
basis all of the terms and conditions to be satisfied by it and contained in the Financing Commitments. Buyer has fully paid all
commitment fees or other fees required by the terms of the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the Execution Date and

and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in <U>Article VIII</U>, and assuming that the Financings are funded
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing
Commitments, together with other financial resources of Buyer including unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
(net of any applicable Tax liabilities) of Buyer on the Closing Date, will be sufficient for Buyer to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, to pay all related fees and expenses of Buyer payable at the Closing, and to fund the Cleaning Work which is necessary

that the breach of this Agreement by the other Parties would cause irreparable damage to such Party and that money damages or other
legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Therefore, the Obligations of each Party under this Agreement,
including Seller&#8217;s obligation to sell the Purchased Shares to Buyer and Buyer&#8217;s obligation to purchase the Purchased
Shares from Seller, shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for
and granted in connection therewith, without the requirement to post any bond or security in connection therewith. Such remedies
shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any Party may have under this
Agreement or otherwise.</P>
