of the other Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to, such Borrower or at law or

of the Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any
foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and remedies under any of
the Loan Documents with respect to all or any part of the Properties. Subject to <U>Section
9.4</U>, any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued

Lender may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law, without
impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender permitted by law, equity
or contract or as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing and to the fullest
extent permitted by law (i)&nbsp;Lender shall not be subject to any &#147;one action&#148; or &#147;election of
remedies&#148; law or rule, and (ii)&nbsp;all liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to

satisfaction of any of the Debt in any preference or priority, and Lender may seek satisfaction out
of one or more of the Properties, or any part thereof, in its absolute discretion in respect of the
Debt. In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Lender shall have the right from time
to time to partially foreclose one or all of the Mortgages in any manner and for any amounts
secured by the Mortgages then due and payable as determined by Lender in its sole discretion
including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i)&nbsp;in the event any Borrower defaults
beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal
and interest, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Mortgages to recover such delinquent payments
or (ii)&nbsp;in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire Outstanding Principal
Balance, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Mortgages to recover so much of the principal
balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by the Mortgages as Lender
may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, each of the Properties shall remain
subject to the applicable Mortgages to secure payment of sums secured by such Mortgages and not
previously recovered.
