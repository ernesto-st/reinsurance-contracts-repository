realized by the Employee from the vesting of all or a portion of this or any award of Restricted Stock shall be paid by the Employee to the Company. Such gain shall be calculated based on the closing price per share of the Company&#146;s common
stock as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of vesting (or the next trading day if such vesting date is a holiday), multiplied by the number of shares vesting on such date, plus interest measured from the first date the Employee

this Agreement by the Employee. The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the requirement in Section&nbsp;5(a)(i) above that Employee disgorge and pay over to the Company any option gain realized by the Employee is not a provision for liquidated
damages. The Employee agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, incurred by the Company in enforcing any breach of any covenant in this Agreement. </FONT></P> <P

other compensation, fringe benefits or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to the Employee by the Company) to the extent of the amounts the Employee owes the Company under Paragraph 5(a) above. Whether or not the Company elects to make
any set-off in whole or in part, if the Company does not recover by means of set-off the full amount owed, calculated as set forth above, the Employee agrees to pay immediately the unpaid balance to the Company. </FONT></P> <P
