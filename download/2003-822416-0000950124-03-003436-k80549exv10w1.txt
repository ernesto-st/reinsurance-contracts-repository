         that such Lender does not intend to make available to the
         Administrative Agent its portion of the Revolving Loans to be made on
         such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has
         made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date of
         such Revolving Loans, and the Administrative Agent in reliance upon
         such assumption, may (in its sole discretion but without any obligation
         to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If
         such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the

         demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the
         Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding
         amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also
         be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrower, as the case may
         be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from
         the date such corresponding amount was made available by the
         Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding
         amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate
         equal to (i) from the Borrower at the applicable rate for such
         Revolving Loan pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from a
         Lender at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

                  (d)      Reductions of Revolving Committed Amount.

                           (i)      Upon at least three Business Days' notice,
                  the Borrower shall have the right to permanently reduce,
                  without premium or penalty, all or part of the aggregate
                  unused amount of the Revolving Committed Amount at any time or
                  from time to time; provided that (A) each partial reduction
                  shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $5,000,000
                  and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 above such amount and
                  (B) no reduction shall be made which would reduce the
                  Revolving Committed Amount to an amount less than the
                  aggregate amount of Revolving Loans outstanding plus the
                  aggregate amount of Swingline Loans outstanding plus the
                  aggregate amount of all LC Obligations outstanding.

                           (ii)     Any reduction in (or termination of) the
                  Revolving Committed Amount may not be reinstated without the
                  consent of all the Lenders; provided, however, the Borrower
                  shall still be entitled to increase the Revolving Committed
                  Amount in accordance with the terms of Section 2.1(e). The
                  Administrative Agent shall immediately notify the Lenders of
                  any reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount.

                  (e)      Increase of Revolving Committed Amount.

                           (i)      Request for Increase. The Borrower may, at
                  any time and from time to time, request, by notice to the
                  Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent's approval of
                  an increase of the Revolving Committed Amount ("Facility
                  Increase"), within the limitations hereafter described, which
                  request shall set forth

                                       24

<PAGE>

                  the amount of each such requested Facility Increase. The
                  Administrative Agent's approval of such request shall not be
                  unreasonably withheld. Within twenty (20) days of such
                  request, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower of
                  its approval or disapproval of such request; failure to so
                  advise the Borrower shall constitute approval. If the
                  Administrative Agent approves any such Facility Increase, then
                  the Revolving Committed Amount may be so increased (up to the
                  amount of such approved Facility Increase, in the aggregate)
                  by having one or more New Lenders increase the amount of their
                  then existing Revolving Loan Commitments or become Lenders
                  with a new Revolving Loan Commitment hereunder, subject to and
                  in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(e). Any
                  Facility Increase shall be subject to the following
                  limitations and conditions: (A) any increase (in the
                  aggregate) in the Revolving Committed Amount and the amount
                  (in the aggregate) of any new Revolving Loan Commitment of any
                  New Lender or the amount (in the aggregate) of any increase in
                  the Revolving Loan Commitment of any New Lender, shall (unless
                  otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent)
                  not be less than $5,000,000 (and shall be in integral
                  multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof); (B) no Facility
                  Increase shall increase the Revolving Committed Amount to an
                  amount in excess of the Aggregate Commitment Limit; (C) the
                  Borrower and each New Lender shall have executed and delivered
                  a commitment and acceptance (the "Commitment and Acceptance")
                  substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.1(e) hereto, and the
                  Administrative Agent shall have accepted and executed the
                  same; (D) the Borrower shall have executed and delivered to
                  the Administrative Agent such Revolving Notes as the
                  Administrative Agent shall require to effect such Facility
                  Increase; (E) the Borrower shall have delivered to the
                  Administrative Agent opinions of counsel (substantially
                  similar to the forms of opinions delivered pursuant to Section
                  5.1(c), modified to apply to the Facility Increase and each
                  Revolving Note and Commitment and Acceptance executed and
                  delivered in connection therewith); (F) the Guarantors shall
                  in writing have consented to the Facility Increase and have
                  agreed that their Guaranties continue in full force and
                  effect, and (G) the Borrower and each New Lender shall
                  otherwise have executed and delivered such other instruments
                  and documents as the Administrative Agent shall have
                  reasonably requested in connection with such Facility
                  Increase. The form and substance of the documents required
                  under clauses (A) through (G) above shall be reasonably
                  acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
                  Agent shall provide written notice to all of the Lenders
                  hereunder of any Facility Increase.

                           (ii)     Loans by New Lenders. Upon the effective
                  date of any increase in the Revolving Committed Amount
                  pursuant to the provisions hereof, which effective date shall
                  be mutually agreed upon by the Borrower, each New Lender and
                  the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall repay all
                  outstanding Floating Rate Loans and reborrow a Floating Rate
                  Loan in a like amount from the Lenders (including the New
                  Lenders), but such New Lenders shall not participate in any
                  then outstanding Eurodollar Loan. If the Borrower shall at any
                  time on or after

                                       25

<PAGE>

                  such effective date convert or continue any Eurodollar Loan
                  that was outstanding on such effective date, the Borrower
                  shall be deemed to repay such Eurodollar Loan on the date of
                  the conversion or continuation thereof and then to reborrow as
                  a new Revolving Loan a like amount on such date so that each
                  New Lender shall advance on such date the amount of its Pro
                  Rata Share of such Revolving Loan. Such New Lender shall make
                  its Pro Rata Share of all Revolving Loans made on or after
                  such effective date and shall otherwise have all of the rights
                  and obligations of a Lender hereunder on and after such
                  effective date. To the extent any Eurodollar Loan is converted
                  or continued after the effective date of an increase in the
                  Revolving Committed Amount and prior to the date on which such
                  New Lender holds its Pro Rata Share of all Revolving Loans,
                  the amount funded by such New Lender as its Pro Rata Share of
                  such converted or continued Loan shall be paid ratably to the
                  other Lenders such that all Lenders (including the New Lender)
                  hold their Pro Rata Share of such converted or continued Loan.
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event
                  of Default prior to the date on which such New Lender is
                  holding its Pro Rata Share of all outstanding Revolving Loans,
                  such New Lender shall immediately (but not prior to such
                  effective date) pay to the Administrative Agent (for the
                  account of the other Lenders, to which the Administrative
                  Agent shall pay their ratable shares thereof upon receipt) a
                  sum equal to such New Lender's Pro Rata Share of each
                  outstanding Eurodollar Loan with respect to which such New
                  Lender does not then hold an interest; such payment by such
                  New Lender shall constitute a Floating Rate Loan by such New
                  Lender hereunder.

                           (iii)    New Lenders' Participation in Facility LCs.
                  Upon the effective date of any increase in the Revolving
                  Committed Amount in accordance with the provisions of Section
                  2.1(e)(ii), each New Lender shall also be deemed to have
                  irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received,
                  without recourse or warranty, from the Lenders party to this
                  Agreement immediately prior to the effective date of such
                  increase, an undivided interest and participation in all
                  Facility LCs and Reimbursement Obligations (if any) then
                  outstanding, ratably, such that each Lender (including each
                  New Lender) holds a participation interest in each Facility LC
                  and all Reimbursement Obligations (if any) in proportion to
                  the ratio that such Lender's Commitment (upon the effective
                  date of such increase in the Revolving Committed Amount) bears
                  to the Revolving Committed Amount as so increased.

                           (iv)     No Obligation to Increase Commitment.
                  Nothing contained herein shall constitute, or otherwise be
                  deemed to be, a commitment or agreement on the part of the
                  Borrower or the Administrative Agent to give or grant any
                  Lender the right to increase any Commitment hereunder at any
                  time or a commitment or agreement on the part of any Lender to
                  increase its Commitment hereunder at any time, and no
                  Commitment of a Lender shall be increased without its prior
                  written approval.

                                       26

         (f)      Revolving Notes. The Revolving Loans made by each Lender shall
be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note of the Borrower to such Lender
in an original principal amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment
and in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.1(f).

2.2      SWINGLINE LOANS SUBFACILITY.

         (a)      Swingline Loans. The Swingline Lender hereby agrees, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the other Credit
Documents, to make revolving loans to the Borrower, in Dollars, at any time and
from time to time during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
not including the Maturity Date (each such loan, a "Swingline Loan" and
collectively, the "Swingline Loans"); provided that (i) the aggregate principal
amount of the Swingline Loans outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the
Swingline Committed Amount, and (ii) the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans
outstanding plus the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans outstanding plus the
aggregate amount of LC Obligations outstanding shall not exceed the Revolving
Committed Amount. Prior to the Maturity Date, Swingline Loans may be repaid and
reborrowed by the Borrower in accordance with the provisions hereof.

         (b)      Method of Borrowing and Funding Swingline Loans. By no later
than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the requested borrowing of Swingline Loans, the
Borrower shall provide telephonic notice to the Swingline Lender, followed
promptly by a written Swingline Loan Request (which may be submitted via
telecopy), each of such telephonic notice and such written Swingline Loan
Request setting forth (i) the amount of the requested Swingline Loan (which
shall not be less than $100,000 and in integral multiples of $50,000 in excess
thereof), (ii) the date of the requested Swingline Loan, (iii) certification
that the Borrower has complied in all respects with Section 5.2 and, to the
extent that the Swingline Loan requested is the initial Extension of Credit,
Section 5.1 and (iv) whether such Swingline Loan is to be a Floating Rate Loan
or an Index Rate Swingline Loan and, if such Swingline Loan is to be an Index
Rate Swingline Loan, the applicable Interest Period. If the Borrower has
requested an Index Rate Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender shall provide to
the Borrower no later than 1:30 p.m. on the date of such request the Adjusted
LIBOR Market Index Rate. The Borrower shall notify the Swingline Lender by 2:00
p.m. on such date whether it wishes to accept the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index
Rate. Failure of the Borrower to timely accept the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index
Rate shall make the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate and the corresponding Index
Rate Swingline Loan void. The Swingline Lender shall initiate the transfer of
funds representing the Swingline Loan advance to the Borrower by 3:00 p.m. on
the Business Day of the requested borrowing.

         (c)      Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans. The Borrower
agrees to repay all Swingline Loans that are Floating Rate Loans within one
Business Day of demand therefor by the Swingline Lender and all Swingline Loans
that are Index Rate Swingline Loans at the end of the applicable Interest
Period; provided that each Swingline Loan shall be repaid within seven Business
Days from the date of advance.

                                       27

<PAGE>

Each repayment of a Swingline Loan may be accomplished by requesting Revolving
Loans, which request is not subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2.
In the event that the Borrower shall fail to timely repay any Swingline Loan,
and in any event upon (i) the request of the Swingline Lender, (ii) the
occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section 9.1(f) or (iii) the
acceleration of any Loan or termination of any Commitment pursuant to Section
9.2, each other Lender shall irrevocably and unconditionally purchase from the
Swingline Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and
participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to such other Lender's
Pro Rata Share thereof, by directly purchasing a participation in such Swingline
Loan in such amount (regardless of whether the conditions precedent thereto set
forth in Section 5.2 hereof are then satisfied (provided the Swingline Lender
believed in good faith that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2
were satisfied at the time of funding of such Swingline Loan), whether or not
the Borrower has submitted a Notice of Borrowing and whether or not the
Commitments are then in effect, any Event of Default exists or all the Loans
have been accelerated) and paying the proceeds thereof to the Swingline Lender
at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 11.1, in Dollars and in
immediately available funds. If such amount is not in fact made available to the
Swingline Lender by any Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to
recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with accrued interest
thereon (to the extent the Borrower fails to pay accrued interest with respect
to such amount) for each day from the date of demand thereof, at the Federal
Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the
Swingline Lender's demand therefor, and until such time as such Lender makes the
required payment, the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have
outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of such unpaid participation
obligation for all purposes of the Credit Documents other than those provisions
requiring the other Lenders to purchase a participation therein. Further, such
Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made of principal
and interest on its Loans, and any other amounts due to it hereunder to the
Swingline Lender to fund Swingline Loans in the amount of the participation in
Swingline Loans that such Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this Section
2.2(c) until such amount has been purchased (as a result of such assignment or
otherwise). On the date the Lenders are required to purchase participations in
outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.2(c), the outstanding
principal amount, including the Swingline Lender's Pro Rata Share, of such
Swingline Loans shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan accruing interest at the
Floating Rate.

         (d)      Interest on Swingline Loans. Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.1, each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal
to the Floating Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate, as applicable.

         (e)      Swingline Note. The Swingline Loans shall be evidenced by a
duly executed promissory note of the Borrower to the Swingline Lender in the
original principal amount of the Swingline Committed Amount and in substantially
the form of Exhibit 2.2(e).

                                       28

         2.3      CONTINUATIONS AND CONVERSIONS.

         The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to continue
existing Eurodollar Loans for a subsequent Interest Period, to convert Floating
Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) into Eurodollar Loans or to convert
Eurodollar Loans into Floating Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans);
provided, however, that (a) each such continuation or conversion must be
requested by the Borrower pursuant to a written Notice of
Continuation/Conversion in compliance with the terms set forth below, (b) except
as provided in Section 3.11, Eurodollar Loans may only be continued or converted
into Floating Rate Loans on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (c) Eurodollar Loans may not be continued nor may Floating Rate Loans
be converted into Eurodollar Loans during the existence and continuation of a
Default or an Event of Default and (d) any request to continue a Eurodollar Loan
that fails to comply with the terms hereof or any failure to request a
continuation of a Eurodollar Loan at the end of an Interest Period shall
constitute a conversion to a Floating Rate Loan on the last day of the
applicable Interest Period. Each continuation or conversion must be requested by
the Borrower no later than 11:00 a.m. (i) on the date for a requested conversion
of a Eurodollar Loan to a Floating Rate Loan or (ii) three Business Days prior
to the date for a requested continuation of a Eurodollar Loan or conversion of a
Floating Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Loan, in each case pursuant to a written
Notice of Continuation/Conversion submitted to the Administrative Agent which
shall set forth (A) whether the Borrower wishes to continue or convert such
Loans and (B) if the request is to continue a Eurodollar Loan or convert a
Floating Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Loan, the Interest Period applicable thereto.

         2.4      MINIMUM AMOUNTS.

         Each request for a borrowing, conversion or continuation shall be
subject to the requirements that (a) each Eurodollar Loan shall be in a minimum
amount of $5,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof), (b) each Floating Rate Loan shall be in a minimum amount of the lesser
of $1,000,000 (and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof) or the
remaining amount available under the Revolving Committed Amount and (c) each
Swingline Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $100,000 (and in integral
multiples of $50,000 in excess thereof) or the remaining amount of the Swingline
Committed Amount. For the purposes of this Section, all Eurodollar Loans with
the same Interest Periods that begin and end on the same date shall be
considered as one Eurodollar Loan, but Eurodollar Loans with different Interest
Periods, even if they begin on the same date, shall be considered as separate
Eurodollar Loans.

         2.5      EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE.

                  (a)      Not more than once each fiscal year of the Borrower,
         the Borrower may, by delivering a written notice to the Administrative
         Agent, request that the Maturity Date be extended for one additional
         year, provided the requested Maturity Date is not more than five (5)
         years from the date of such request. The Administrative Agent shall
         notify each Lender of such request promptly upon its receipt of such
         notice and shall request that each Lender respond to such request by
         the Borrower within sixty (60) days of the Administrative Agent's
         notice to the Lenders. If any Lender does not consent in writing

                                       29

<PAGE>

         or respond to the Borrower's request then such Lender (a "Refusing
         Lender") shall be deemed to have rejected such request. If Lenders
         whose combined Pro Rata Shares equal at least 66-2/3% (the "Extension
         Required Lenders"; each Lender agreeing to extend its Revolving Loan
         Commitment is referred to herein as an "Extending Lender") agree in
         writing within such 60-day period to extend their Revolving Loan
         Commitments, then (i) the Revolving Loan Commitments of the Extending
         Lenders shall without further action be extended for an additional
         one-year period, (ii) the term "Maturity Date" shall thenceforth mean,
         (A) as to the Commitments and Loans of the Extending Lenders, the last
         day of such additional one-year period and (B) as to the Commitments
         and Loans of the Refusing Lenders, the Maturity Date in effect prior to
         such extension (each a "RL Maturity Date"), (iii) subject to the terms
         of subsection (b) below, the Revolving Loan Commitments of the Refusing
         Lenders shall terminate on the applicable RL Maturity Date and the
         Loans and other amounts owed to such Lenders shall be due and payable
         on such date and (iv) subject to the terms of subsection (b) below, on
         an RL Maturity Date (A) the Revolving Committed Amount shall be reduced
         by an amount equal to the sum of the Revolving Loan Commitments of the
         applicable Refusing Lenders and (B) the Pro Rata Shares of the
         Extending Lenders shall be reallocated so that the sum of such Pro Rata
         Shares equals one hundred percent (100%). If such extension is not
         approved in writing by the Extension Required Lenders within such
         60-day period, the Maturity Date then in effect will be retained.

                  (b)      So long as the Extension Required Lenders consent to
         the extension of the Maturity Date in accordance with the terms of
         Section 2.5(a):

                           (i)      with respect to any Refusing Lender, the
                  Borrower may request, in its own discretion and at its own
                  expense, such Refusing Lender to transfer and assign (and such
                  Refusing Lender shall be required to transfer and assign upon
                  such request) in whole (but not in part), without recourse,
                  representation or warranty (except as provided in Section
                  11.3(b)) and otherwise in accordance with and subject to the
                  terms of Section 11.3(b), all of its interests, rights and
                  obligations under this Credit Agreement to one or more
                  Eligible Assignees (which may be one or more existing Lenders
                  if any existing Lender accepts such assignment); provided that
                  (A) such assignment or assignments shall not conflict with any
                  law, rule, regulation or order of any court or other
                  Governmental Authority, (B) the Borrower or such Eligible
                  Assignee or Eligible Assignees shall pay to such Refusing
                  Lender in immediately available funds the principal of and
                  interest accrued to the date of such payment on the portion of
                  the Loans hereunder held by such Refusing Lender and all other
                  amounts owed to such Refusing Lender hereunder, as well as any
                  processing fee owing to the Administrative Agent under Section
                  11.3(b), (C) the maturity date of the Loans transferred to
                  such Eligible Assignee shall be the Maturity Date as extended
                  in accordance with Section 2.5(a) above and (D) such transfer
                  and assignment must occur on or prior to the applicable RL
                  Maturity Date; or

                                       30

<PAGE>

                           (ii)     the Borrower may (A) notify the
                  Administrative Agent and the Extending Lenders in writing that
                  it wishes to (and each such Extending Lender shall agree to)
                  reduce the Revolving Loan Committed Amount by an amount equal
                  to the sum of the Revolving Loan Commitments of the Refusing
                  Lenders, (B) pay all outstanding Loans of the Refusing Lenders
                  and any other amounts owing to the Refusing Lenders, and
                  terminate the Revolving Loan Commitments of the Refusing
                  Lenders and (C) reallocate the Pro Rata Share of the Extending
                  Lenders, on a pro rata basis, so that the sum of such Pro Rata
                  Shares equals one hundred percent (100%).

                  (c)      The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender (whether an
         Extending Lender or Refusing Lender) for any loss or expense payable to
         such Lender pursuant to Section 3.14 as a result of any extension of
         the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.5 and any assignment of
         such Lender's Commitments and Loans or any reallocation of such
         Lender's Pro Rata Share in connection with such extension.

                  (d)      Each of the Lenders hereby authorizes the
         Administrative Agent, on their behalf, to enter into an amendment to
         this Credit Agreement (and the Borrower hereby agrees to enter into any
         such amendment on terms reasonably acceptable to the Credit Parties and
         the Administrative Agent) to effectuate any extension of the Maturity
         Date, reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount, repayment of Loans
         or reallocation of the Pro Rata Shares, in each case as expressly
         contemplated by the terms of this Section 2.5.

         2.6      TELEPHONIC NOTICES.

         The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
to extend, convert or continue Loans, effect selections of Floating Rate Loans,
Eurodollar Loans and Index Rate Swingline Loans and to transfer funds based on
telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower, it being
understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow
Notices of Borrowing, Notices of Continuation/Conversion and Swingline Loan
Requests to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to
the Administrative Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is
requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice
signed by an authorized officer of the Borrower. If the written confirmation
differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
shall govern absent manifest error.

         2.7      LENDING INSTALLATIONS.

         Each Lender may book its Loans and its participation in any LC
Obligations and each LC Issuer may book the Facility LCs issued by it at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case may
be, and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this
Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the

                                       31

<PAGE>

Loans, Facility LCs, participations in LC Obligations and any Notes issued
hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender or LC Issuer, as the case may be,
for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender and LC Issuer may,
by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance
with Section 11.1, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations
through which Loans will be made by it or Facility LCs will be issued by it and
for whose account Loan payments or payments with respect to Facility LCs are to
be made.

                                   SECTION 3

                     GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO LOANS

         3.1      INTEREST.

                  (a)      Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section
         3.1(b):

                           (i)      Floating Rate Loans. During such periods as
                  Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of Floating Rate
                  Loans, such Floating Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per
                  annum rate equal to the Floating Rate.

                           (ii)     Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as
                  Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of Eurodollar
                  Loans, such Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest at a per
                  annum rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate.

                           (iii)    Swingline Loans. Swingline Loans shall bear
                  interest in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2(d).

                  (b)      Default Rate of Interest. Upon the occurrence, and
         during the continuance, of an Event of Default, upon notice from the
         Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders (or, in
         the case of an Event of Default under Section 9.1(f), automatically
         without notice or any action) (i) the principal of and, to the extent
         permitted by law, interest on the Loans and any other amounts owing
         hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (including without
         limitation fees and expenses) shall bear interest, payable on demand,
         at a per annum rate equal to two percent (2%) plus the rate which would
         otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable, then the rate for
         Revolving Loans that are Floating Rate Loans plus two percent (2%) per
         annum) and (ii) the Facility LC Fee Rate shall be increased to a per
         annum rate equal to two percent (2%) plus the Facility LC Fee Rate
         which would otherwise be applicable.

                  (c)      Interest Payments. Interest on Loans shall be due and
         payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date. If an Interest
         Payment Date falls on a date which is not a Business Day, such Interest
         Payment Date shall be deemed to be the next succeeding Business Day,
         except that in the case of Eurodollar Loans where the next succeeding
         Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, then such
         Interest Payment Date shall be deemed to be the next preceding Business
         Day.

                                       32

<PAGE>

         3.2      PLACE AND MANNER OF PAYMENTS.

         All payments of principal, interest, fees, expenses and other amounts
to be made by a Credit Party under this Credit Agreement shall be made without
setoff, deduction or counterclaim and received not later than 1:00 p.m. on the
date when due, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, by the
Administrative Agent at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 11.1.
Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the
next Business Day. The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under
this Credit Agreement, specify to the Administrative Agent the Loans, fees or
other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be
applied (and in the event that it fails to specify, or if such application would
be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall, subject
to Section 3.7, distribute such payment to the Lenders in such manner as the
Administrative Agent may deem appropriate). The Administrative Agent will
distribute such payments to the applicable Lenders on the same Business Day if
any such payment is received prior to 1:00 p.m.; otherwise the Administrative
Agent will distribute such payment to the applicable Lenders not later than the
next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to
be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and
fees for the period of such extension), except that in the case of Eurodollar
Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following
calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next preceding
Business Day.

         3.3      PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a)      Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the
         right to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time without
         premium or penalty; provided, however, that (i) Eurodollar Loans may
         only be prepaid on three Business Days' prior written notice to the
         Administrative Agent and (ii) each such partial prepayment of Loans
         shall be in the minimum principal amount of (A) $5,000,000 and integral
         multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof for Revolving Loans and (B)
         $100,000 and integral multiples of $50,000 in excess thereof for
         Swingline Loans. All prepayments under this Section shall be subject to
         Section 3.14 and be accompanied by interest on the principal amount
         prepaid through the date of prepayment.

                  (b)      Mandatory Prepayments. If, at any time, the sum of
         the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans outstanding plus Swingline
         Loans outstanding plus the aggregate amount of all LC Obligations
         exceeds the Revolving Committed Amount, the Borrower shall immediately
         make a principal payment to the Administrative Agent in the manner and
         in an amount such that the sum of the aggregate amount of Revolving
         Loans outstanding plus Swingline Loans outstanding plus the aggregate
         amount of all LC Obligations outstanding is less than or equal to the
         Revolving Committed Amount (to be applied as set forth in Section
         3.3(c) below).

         (c)      Application of Prepayments. All amounts required to be paid
         pursuant to Section 3.3(b) shall be applied first to Swingline Loans
         and second to Revolving Loans. Within the parameters of the
         applications set forth above, prepayments shall be applied

                                       33

<PAGE>

         first to Floating Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans (or Index
         Rate Swingline Loans, as applicable) in direct order of Interest Period
         maturities. All prepayments hereunder shall be subject to Section 3.14
         and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid
         through the date of prepayment.

         3.4      FEES.

                  (a)      Commitment Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders commitment
         fees ("Commitment Fees") at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable
         Percentage (for Commitment Fees) of the Unused Revolving Committed
         Amount, payable in arrears on the first Business Day of each calendar
         quarter and upon the Maturity Date and any earlier date on which the
         Commitments are terminated hereunder. The Swingline Loans shall
         constitute usage of the Revolving Credit Commitment of the Swingline
         Lender.

                  (b)      Administrative Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to
         the Administrative Agent, for its own account, administrative fees (the
         "Administrative Fees") in accordance with the terms of the Fee Letter.

                  (c)      Extension Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the pro rata benefit of each Extending Lender,
         at the time of any extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section
         2.5, such extension fees as are agreed upon among the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent and such Extending Lenders.

                  (d)      Upfront Fees. In consideration of the Revolving
         Committed Amount being made available by the Lenders hereunder, the
         Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender an upfront fee in accordance with
         the terms of the Arranger's invitation letter to prospective Lenders
         dated August 13, 2003 (the "Upfront Fees"). The Upfront Fees shall be
         due and payable on or prior to the Effective Date.

         3.5      PAYMENT IN FULL AT MATURITY.

         On the Maturity Date, the entire outstanding principal balance of all
Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans, together with accrued but unpaid interest
and all other sums owing with respect thereto, shall be due and payable in full,
unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2.

                                       34

<PAGE>

         3.6      COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST AND FEES.

                  (a)      Except for Floating Rate Loans and Swingline Loans,
         in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366
         day year as the case may be, all computations of interest and fees
         hereunder shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days
         elapsed over a year of 360 days. Interest shall accrue from and include
         the date of borrowing (or continuation or conversion) but exclude the
         date of payment.

                  (b)      It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit
         Parties to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable
         usury law from time to time in effect. All agreements between the
         Lenders and the Borrower are hereby limited by the provisions of this
         paragraph which shall override and control all such agreements, whether
         now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral. In no
         way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to
         prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall
         the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received
         under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the
         maximum nonusurious amount permissible under applicable law. If, from
         any possible construction of any of the Credit Documents or any other
         document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum
         nonusurious amount, any such construction shall be subject to the
         provisions of this paragraph and such documents shall be automatically
         reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted under applicable
         law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new
         document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is
         characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which
         would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum lawful
         amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive
         interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the
         principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the payment of interest,
         or refunded to the Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the
         extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid
         principal amount of the Loans. The right to demand payment of the Loans
         or any other Indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does
         not include the right to accelerate the payment of any interest which
         has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders
         do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event
         of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders
         with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
         law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full
         stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that
         the amount of interest on account of such Indebtedness does not exceed
         the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law.

         3.7      PRO RATA TREATMENT.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, each Revolving Loan
borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Revolving Loan, each
payment of fees (other than the Administrative Fees retained by the
Administrative Agent for its own account and fees payable to a LC Issuer), each
reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount, and each conversion or

                                       35
<PAGE>

continuation of any Revolving Loan, shall (except as otherwise provided in
Section 3.11) be allocated pro rata among the relevant Lenders in accordance
with the respective Pro Rata Shares of such Lenders (or, if the Commitments of
such Lenders have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective
principal amounts of the outstanding Loans and Participation Interests of such
Lenders); provided that, if any Lender shall have failed to pay its applicable
pro rata share of any Revolving Loan, then any amount to which such Lender would
otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall instead be payable to
the Administrative Agent until the share of such Revolving Loan not funded by
such Lender has been repaid; provided further, that in the event any amount paid
to any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.7 is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned by the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall, upon the request of the
Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so paid to
such Lender, with interest for the period commencing on the date such payment is
returned by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent
receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to, during the period to but
excluding the date two Business Days after such request, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate, and thereafter, the Floating Rate plus two percent (2%) per
annum.

         3.8      SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         The Lenders agree among themselves that, except to the extent otherwise
provided herein, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of
any Loan or any other obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit
Agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien or
counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy
Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured
claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata
share of such payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender
shall promptly pay in cash or purchase from the other Lenders a participation in
such Loans and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other
adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders
share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as
provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree among
themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the
exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as
aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which
shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by payment in cash or a
repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
(together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto)
to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including
setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the
amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit
to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender
or such Administrative Agent to such Administrative Agent or such other Lender
pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such
payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the
date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to such
Administrative Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Effective Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy,

                                       36

<PAGE>

insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of
a setoff to which this Section 3.8 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent
practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner
consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.8 to share in the
benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

         3.9      CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         If, after the date hereof, any Lender or LC Issuer has determined that
the adoption or the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by
any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof in the interpretation or administration
of, any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or
compliance by such Lender or LC Issuer, or the parent corporation of such Lender
or LC Issuer, with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether
or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Lender's or LC Issuer's (or parent corporation's) capital or assets as a
consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Lender or LC Issuer, or the parent corporation of such Lender or LC
Issuer, could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or LC Issuer's (or parent
corporation's) policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon written
notice from such Lender or LC Issuer to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be
obligated to pay to such Lender or LC Issuer such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Lender or LC Issuer on an after-tax basis (after taking
into account applicable deductions and credits in respect of the amount
indemnified) for such reduction. Each such written notice of a determination by
any such Lender or LC Issuer of amounts owing under this Section 3.9 shall set
forth and certify in reasonable detail the basis for such determination and the
calculation of amounts so owing, which certification shall, absent manifest
error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the Borrower shall not be required to make any
payments to any Lender or LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 3.9 relating to any period of time which is greater than 90 days prior
to such Person's request for additional payment except for retroactive
application of such law, rule or regulation, in which case the Borrower is
required to make such payments so long as such Person makes a request therefor
within 90 days after the public announcement of such retroactive application.
This covenant shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the
payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         3.10     INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE.

         If prior to the first day of any Interest Period, the Administrative
Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances
affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the Eurodollar Base Rate for such Interest Period, the
Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the
Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter, and will also give
prompt written notice to the Borrower when such conditions no longer exist. If
such notice is given (a) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first
day of such Interest Period shall be made as Floating Rate Loans and (b) any
Loans that

                                       37

<PAGE>

were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to or
continued as Eurodollar Loans shall be converted to or continued as Floating
Rate Loans. Until such notice is withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no
further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the
Borrower have the right to convert Floating Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans.

         3.11     ILLEGALITY.

         Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof
occurring after the Closing Date shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make
or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement, (a) such
Lender shall promptly give written notice of such circumstances to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such
circumstances no longer exist), (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to
make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert a Floating
Rate Loan to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be canceled and, until such time
as it shall no longer be unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans, such Lender shall then have a commitment only to make a Floating Rate
Loan when a Eurodollar Loan is requested and (c) such Lender's Loans then
outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to
Floating Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest
Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by
law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not
the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the
Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required
pursuant to Section 3.14.

         3.12     REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

         If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the
interpretation or application thereof applicable to any Lender or LC Issuer, or
compliance by any Lender or LC Issuer with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority, in each case made subsequent to the Closing Date (or, if later, the
date on which such Lender becomes a Lender):

                  (a)      shall subject such Lender or LC Issuer to any tax of
         any kind whatsoever with respect to any Eurodollar Loans made by it or
         its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans or with respect to any Facility
         LCs or its participation therein, or change the basis of taxation of
         payments to such Lender or LC Issuer in respect thereof (except for
         Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 3.13 (including Non-Excluded
         Taxes imposed solely by reason of any failure of such Lender to comply
         with its obligations under Section 3.13(b)) and changes in taxes
         measured by or imposed upon the overall net income, or franchise tax
         (imposed in lieu of such net income tax), of such Lender or LC Issuer
         or its applicable lending office, branch, or any affiliate thereof);

                  (b)      shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
         held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
         advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other

                                       38

<PAGE>

         acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender or LC Issuer which
         is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Base
         Rate hereunder; or

                  (c)      shall impose on such Lender or LC Issuer any other
         condition (excluding any tax of any kind whatsoever);

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
LC Issuer , by an amount which such Lender or LC Issuer deems to be material, of
making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing
or participating in any Facility LC or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder
in respect thereof, then, in any such case, upon notice to the Borrower from
such Lender or LC Issuer, through the Administrative Agent, in accordance
herewith, the Borrower shall be obligated to promptly pay such Lender or LC
Issuer , upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender or LC Issuer on an after-tax basis (after taking into account applicable
deductions and credits in respect of the amount indemnified) for such increased
cost or reduced amount receivable, provided that, in any such case, the Borrower
may elect to convert the Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender hereunder to
Floating Rate Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least one Business
Day's notice of such election, in which case the Borrower shall promptly pay to
such Lender or LC Issuer, upon demand, without duplication, such amounts, if
any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.14. If any Lender or LC Issuer
becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.12,
it shall provide prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, through the
Administrative Agent, certifying (x) that one of the events described in this
Section 3.12 has occurred and describing in reasonable detail the nature of such
event, (y) as to the increased cost or reduced amount resulting from such event
and (z) as to the additional amount demanded by such Lender or LC Issuer and a
reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof. Such a certificate
as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.12 submitted by
such Lender or LC Issuer, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower
shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto in the absence of manifest
error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and
the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Borrower shall
not be required to make any payments to any Lender or LC Issuer or the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section relating to any period of time
which is greater than 90 days prior to such Person's request for additional
payment except for retroactive application of such law, rule or regulation, in
which case the Borrower is required to make such payments so long as such Person
makes a request therefor within 90 days after the public announcement of such
retroactive application.

         3.13     TAXES.

                  (a)      Withholding. Except as provided below in this Section
         3.13, all payments made by the Borrower under this Credit Agreement and
         any Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
         withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp
         or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
         withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or
         assessed by any court, or governmental body, agency or other official,
         excluding taxes measured by or imposed upon the net income of any
         Lender or its applicable lending office, or any branch

                                       39

<PAGE>

         or affiliate thereof, and all franchise taxes, branch taxes, taxes on
         doing business or taxes on the capital or net worth of any Lender or
         its applicable lending office, or any branch or affiliate thereof, in
         each case imposed in lieu of net income taxes: (i) by the jurisdiction
         under the laws of which such Lender, applicable lending office, branch
         or affiliate is organized or is located, or in which its principal
         executive office is located, or any nation within which such
         jurisdiction is located or any political subdivision thereof; or (ii)
         by reason of any connection between the jurisdiction imposing such tax
         and such Lender, applicable lending office, branch or affiliate other
         than a connection arising solely from such Lender having executed,
         delivered or performed its obligations, or received payment under or
         enforced, this Credit Agreement or any Notes. If any such non-excluded
         taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
         withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be withheld from
         any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder
         or under any Notes, (A) the amounts so payable to the Administrative
         Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to
         yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all
         Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable
         hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Credit
         Agreement and any Notes, provided, however, that the Borrower shall be
         entitled to deduct and withhold any Non-Excluded Taxes and shall not be
         required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender if such
         Lender fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this
         Section 3.13 whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the
         Borrower, (B) as promptly as possible after requested the Borrower
         shall send to such Administrative Agent for its own account or for the
         account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an
         original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment
         thereof and (C) with respect to any withholding of United States
         federal income tax, the Borrower shall apply to the payments the
         required withholding tax rates provided by the applicable United States
         withholding tax rules, including but not limited to Internal Revenue
         Code Section 1441, 1442, 3406 and 6049. If the Borrower fails to pay
         any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or
         fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or
         other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the
         Administrative Agent and any Lender for any incremental Non-Excluded
         Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The
         agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this
         Credit Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
         payable hereunder.

                  (b)      U.S. and Non-U.S. Lenders

                           (i)      Each Lender, including each Lender that is
                  not incorporated under the laws of the United States of
                  America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender"), agrees
                  that it will, not more than ten (10) Business Days after the
                  date of this Agreement, (i) deliver to the Administrative
                  Agent two duly completed copies of the applicable United
                  States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, including but
                  not limited to United States Internal Revenue Service Form
                  W-8BEN or W-8ECI or (ii) the case of a Non-U.S. Lender
                  claiming exemption from

                                       40

<PAGE>

                  the withholding of United States federal income tax under
                  Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments
                  of "portfolio interest," deliver two duly completed copies of
                  the applicable United States Internal Revenue Service Form
                  W-8, including but not limited to a United States Internal
                  Revenue Service Form W-8BEN and a certificate representing
                  that such Lender is not (A) a "bank" for purposes of Section
                  881(c) of the Code, (B) a ten-percent shareholder of the
                  Borrower (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the
                  Code) or (C) a controlled foreign corporation related to the
                  Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the
                  Code), certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled
                  to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
                  withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each
                  Lender further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower
                  and the Administrative Agent (x) renewals or additional copies
                  of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date
                  that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the
                  occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent
                  forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments
                  thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
                  Administrative Agent. All forms or amendments described in the
                  preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled
                  to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
                  withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless
                  an event (including without limitation any change in treaty,
                  law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any
                  such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all
                  such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender
                  from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment
                  with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and
                  the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving
                  payments without any deduction or withholding of United States
                  federal income tax.

                           (ii)     For any period during which a Lender has
                  failed to provide the Borrower with an appropriate form
                  pursuant to clause (i) above (unless such failure is due to a
                  change in treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the
                  interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
                  authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form
                  originally was required to be provided), such Lender shall not
                  be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.13 with
                  respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that,
                  should a Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a
                  reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes
                  because of its failure to deliver a form required under clause
                  (i) above, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender
                  shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such
                  Taxes.

                           (iii)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption
                  from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments
                  under this Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any
                  relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver to the
                  Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the
                  time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly
                  completed and executed

                                       41

<PAGE>

                  documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such
                  payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

                           (iv)     If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any
                  other governmental authority of the United States or any other
                  country or any political subdivision thereof asserts a claim
                  that the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as applicable,
                  did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the
                  account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not
                  delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to
                  notify the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as
                  applicable, of a change in circumstances which rendered its
                  exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other
                  reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
                  or the Borrower, as applicable, fully for all amounts paid,
                  directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent or the
                  Borrower, as applicable, as tax, withholding therefor, or
                  otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including
                  taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the
                  Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as applicable, under
                  this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related
                  thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of
                  attorneys for the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as
                  applicable, which attorneys may be employees of the
                  Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as applicable). The
                  obligations of the Lenders under this clause (iv) shall
                  survive the payment of the Obligations and termination of this
                  Agreement.

                           (v)      Notwithstanding the above, if any change in
                  treaty, law or regulation has occurred after the date such
                  Person becomes a Lender hereunder which renders all such forms
                  (or successor forms) inapplicable or which would prevent such
                  Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with
                  respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent, then such Lender shall be exempt from
                  such requirements. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a
                  participant of a Lender pursuant to Section 11.3 shall, upon
                  the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to
                  provide all of the forms, certifications and statements
                  required pursuant to this subsection (b); provided that in the
                  case of a participant of a Lender, the obligations of such
                  participant of a Lender pursuant to this subsection (b) shall
                  be determined as if the participant of a Lender were a Lender
                  except that such participant of a Lender shall furnish all
                  such required forms, certifications and statements to the
                  Lender from which the related participation shall have been
                  purchased.

         3.14     COMPENSATION.

         The Borrower promises to indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender
harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion
into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice
requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Credit Agreement,
(b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan after
the

                                       42

<PAGE>

Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Credit Agreement and (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day
which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such
indemnification may include an amount equal to (i) the amount of interest which
would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or
continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to
borrow, convert or continue to the last day of the applicable Interest Period
(or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest
Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at
the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein
(excluding, however, the Applicable Percentage included therein, if any) minus
(ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which
would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on
deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar
market. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this
Credit Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

         3.15     SUBSTITUTION OF LENDER.

         If (a) the obligation of any Lender to make Eurodollar Loans has been
suspended pursuant to Section 3.11 or (b) any Lender has demanded compensation
under Section 3.9, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14, the Borrower shall have the right,
with the assistance of the Administrative Agent, to seek a mutually satisfactory
substitute lender or lenders. Any substitution under this Section 3.15 may be
accomplished, at the Borrower's option, either (i) by the replaced Lender
assigning its rights and obligations hereunder to a replacement lender or
lenders pursuant to Section 11.3(b) at a mutually agreeable price or (ii) by the
Borrower's prepaying all outstanding Loans from the replaced Lender and
terminating such Lender's Commitment on a date specified in a notice delivered
to the Administrative Agent and the replaced Lender at least three Business Days
before the date so specified (and compensating such Lender for any resulting
funding losses as provided in Section 3.14 but otherwise without premium or
penalty) and concurrently a replacement Lender or Lenders assuming a Commitment
in an amount equal to the Commitment being terminated and making Loans in the
same aggregate amount and having the same maturity date or dates, respectively,
as the Loans being prepaid, all pursuant to documents reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent (and in the case of any document to be signed by the
replaced Lender, reasonably satisfactory to such Lender). No such substitution
shall relieve the Borrower of its obligations to compensate and/or indemnify the
replaced Lender as required by Section 3.9, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14 with
respect to the period before it is replaced and to pay all accrued interest,
accrued fees and other amounts owing to the replaced Lender hereunder.

         3.16     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

                  (a)      Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts
         evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to
         time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
         to such Lender from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each
         Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its
         account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from
         time to time, as necessary.

                                       43

<PAGE>

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register
         pursuant to Section 11.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which
         Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the
         amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the
         amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due
         and payable to each Lender hereunder, and (iii) the amount of any sum
         received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account
         of the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof, if any. The
         Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the
         accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and
         to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.

                  (c)      The entries made in the accounts, Register and
         subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.16
         (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent,
         subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
         amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided,
         however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to
         maintain such account, such Register, or such subaccount, as
         applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the
         obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans made by such Lender in
         accordance with the terms hereof.

                                    SECTION 4

                                  FACILITY LCs

         4.1      ISSUANCE.

         Each LC Issuer hereby agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, to issue standby Letters of Credit (each such Letter of Credit
and each Existing Letter of Credit, a "Facility LC") and to renew, extend,
increase, decrease or otherwise modify each Facility LC ("Modify," and each such
action a "Modification"), from time to time from and including the date of this
Agreement and not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date
upon the request of the Borrower; provided that immediately after each such
Facility LC is issued or Modified, (i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding
LC Obligations shall not exceed the Aggregate LC Commitment and (ii) the sum of
the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans outstanding plus the aggregate amount of
Swingline Loans outstanding plus the aggregate amount of all LC Obligations
outstanding shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. No Facility LC
shall have an expiry date later than the earlier of the fifth (5th) Business Day
prior to the Maturity Date.

         4.2      PARTICIPATIONS.

         Upon the Effective Date (in the case of the Existing Letters of Credit)
and upon issuance or Modification by an LC Issuer of a Facility LC in accordance
with this Section 4, such LC Issuer shall be deemed, without further action by
any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each Lender,
and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to
have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from such LC Issuer, a

                                       44

participation in such Facility LC (and each Modification thereof) and the
related LC Obligations in proportion to its Pro Rata Share.

         4.3      NOTICE.

         Subject to Section 4.1, the Borrower shall give the LC Issuer notice
prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
proposed date of issuance or Modification of each Facility LC, specifying the
beneficiary, the proposed date of issuance (or Modification) and the expiry date
of such Facility LC, and describing the proposed terms of such Facility LC and
the nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby (the "Facility
LC Request"). Upon receipt of such Facility LC Request, the LC Issuer shall
promptly (and in any event prior to the issuance (or Modification) of such
Facility LC) notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender, of the contents thereof and of the amount of such
Lender's participation in such proposed Facility LC, which notices to and by the
Administrative Agent may be given by fax or e-mail. The issuance or Modification
by an LC Issuer of any Facility LC shall, in addition to the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 5 (the satisfaction of which the LC Issuer shall
have no duty to ascertain), be subject to the conditions precedent that (a) the
LC Issuer shall have received confirmation (which may be given by fax or e-mail)
from the Administrative Agent that the issuance (or Modification) of such
Facility LC is in compliance with the limitations set forth in Sections
2.1(a)(i) and 4.1, (b) such Facility LC shall be satisfactory to such LC Issuer
and (c) the Borrower shall have executed and delivered such application
agreement and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to such Facility
LC as such LC Issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a "Facility LC
Application"). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement
and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the terms of this Agreement shall
control.

         4.4      FEES; REPORTING.

                  (a)      Facility LC Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent, solely for the account of the Lenders, a fee (the
         "Facility LC Fee") with respect to each Facility LC for the period from
         the Issuance Date thereof (or, in the case of the Existing Letters of
         Credit, the Effective Date) to and including the final expiration date
         thereof, in a per annum amount equal to the product, calculated on a
         daily basis for each day during such period, of (A) the undrawn amount
         of such Facility LC for such day multiplied by (B) the Facility LC Fee
         Rate for such day, less 0.125% per annum. The Facility LC Fees shall be
         due and payable quarterly in arrears not later than five (5) Business
         Days following Administrative Agent's delivery to Borrower of the
         quarterly statement of Facility LC Fees and, to the extent any such
         fees are then due and unpaid, on the Maturity Date. The Administrative
         Agent shall promptly remit such Facility LC Fees, when received by the
         Administrative Agent, to the Lenders (including the LC Issuers) in
         accordance with their Pro Rata Shares thereof. The Facility LC Fees,
         once paid, shall not be refundable for any reason.

                  (b)      Fronting Fee. The Borrower shall also pay to the
         Administrative Agent, solely for the account of each LC Issuer, as a
         Fronting Fee ("Fronting Fee"), with respect

                                       45

<PAGE>

         to each Facility LC issued by such LC Issuer for the period from the
         Issuance Date thereof (or, in the case of the Existing Letters of
         Credit, the Effective Date) to and including the final expiration date
         thereof, in an amount equal to the product, calculated on a daily basis
         for each day during such period, of (x) the undrawn amount of such
         Facility LC for such day multiplied by (y) 0.125% per annum. The
         Fronting Fees shall also be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the
         date on which Facility LC Fees are payable and, to the extent any
         Fronting Fees are then due and unpaid, on the Maturity Date. The
         Administrative Agent shall promptly remit such Fronting Fee, when
         received by the Administrative Agent, to the applicable LC Issuer. The
         Fronting Fees, once paid, shall not be refundable for any reason. The
         Borrower shall also pay to the LC Issuer for its own account
         documentary and processing charges in connection with the issuance or
         Modification of and draws under Facility LCs in accordance with the LC
         Issuer's standard schedule for such charges as in effect from time to
         time.

                  (c)      LC Issuer Reports; Quarterly Statements. Each LC
         Issuer shall, no later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the
         last day of each month, provide to the Administrative Agent a schedule
         of the Facility LCs issued by it, in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, showing the Issuance Date,
         account party, original face amount (if any) paid thereunder,
         expiration date and the reference number of each Facility LC
         outstanding at any time during such month (and whether such Facility LC
         is a performance Letter of Credit or financial Letter of Credit) and
         the aggregate amount (if any) payable by the Borrower to such LC Issuer
         during the month pursuant to Sections 3.9 and 3.12 . Copies of such
         reports shall be provided promptly to each Lender and the Borrower by
         the Administrative Agent. The reporting requirements hereunder are in
         addition to those set forth in Section 4.3. The Administrative Agent
         shall, with reasonable promptness following receipt from all LC Issuers
         of the reports provided for in this Section 4.4(c) for the months of
         March, June, September and December, respectively, deliver to the
         Borrower a quarterly statement of the Facility LC Fees and Fronting
         Fees then due and payable.

         4.5      ADMINISTRATION; REIMBURSEMENT BY LENDERS.

         Upon receipt by an LC Issuer from the beneficiary of any Facility LC of
any demand for payment under a Facility LC issued by such LC Issuer, such LC
Issuer shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Borrower and each other Lender as to the amount to be paid
by the LC Issuer as a result of such demand and the proposed payment date (the
"LC Payment Date"). The responsibility of the LC Issuer to the Borrower and each
Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each demand for
payment) delivered under each Facility LC in connection with such presentment
shall be in conformity in all material respects with such Facility LC. An LC
Issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance and
administration of the Facility LCs as it does with respect to Letters of Credit
in which no participations are granted, it being understood that in the absence
of any gross negligence or willful misconduct by an LC Issuer, each Lender shall
be unconditionally and irrevocably liable without regard to the occurrence of
any Default or any condition precedent whatsoever, to reimburse such LC Issuer
on demand for (i) such Lender's

                                       46

<PAGE>

Pro Rata Share of the amount of each payment made by such LC Issuer under each
Facility LC to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant
to Section 4.6 below, plus (ii) interest on the foregoing amount to be
reimbursed by such Lender, for each day from the date of such LC Issuer's demand
for such reimbursement (or, if such demand is made after 11:00 a.m. on such
date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date on which such Lender
pays the amount to be reimbursed by it, at a rate of interest per annum equal to
the Federal Funds Effective Rate for the first three days and, thereafter, at a
rate of interest equal to the rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances.

         4.6      REIMBURSEMENT BY BORROWER.

         The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to
reimburse the LC Issuer on or before the applicable LC Payment Date for any
Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Facility LC upon any drawing under
such Facility LC, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of
any kind; provided that neither the Borrower nor any Lender shall hereby be
precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages
suffered by the Borrower or such Lender to the extent, but only to the extent,
caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the LC Issuer in
determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC issued by it
complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (ii) the LC Issuer's failure to
pay under any Facility LC issued by it after the presentation to it of a request
strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC. Each LC
Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent of its receipt of any draft received with respect to any
Facility LC issued by such LC Issuer, but the failure to give (or any delay in
giving) such notice shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder.
All Reimbursement Obligations remaining unpaid by the Borrower after notice
thereof has been given to the Borrower shall bear interest, payable on demand,
for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to (x) the rate applicable to
Floating Rate Advances for such day if such day falls on or before the
applicable LC Payment Date and (y) a per annum rate equal to two percent (2%)
plus the Floating Rate for such day if such day falls after such LC Payment
Date. Each LC Issuer will pay to each Lender ratably in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share all amounts received by it from the Borrower for application in
payment, in whole or in part, of the Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any
Facility LC issued by such LC Issuer, but only to the extent such Lender has
made payment to the LC Issuer in respect of such Facility LC pursuant to Section
4.5. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including without
limitation the submission of a Borrowing Notice in compliance with Section
2.1(b) and the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in
Section 5), the Borrower may request an Advance hereunder for the purpose of
satisfying any Reimbursement Obligation.

         4.7      OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE.

         The Borrower's obligations under this Section 4.7 shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff,
counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had
against any LC Issuer, any Lender or any beneficiary of a Facility LC. The
Borrower further agrees with each LC Issuer and the Lenders that the LC Issuer
and the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's

                                       47

<PAGE>

Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC shall not be affected by,
among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any
endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any
or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among
the Borrower, any of its Affiliates, the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any
financing institution or other party to whom any Facility LC may be transferred
or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower or of any of its Affiliates
against the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any such transferee. The LC Issuer
shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in
transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however
transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC. The Borrower agrees that any
action taken or omitted by any LC Issuer or Lender under or in connection with
each Facility LC and the related drafts and documents, if done without gross
negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall
not put any LC Issuer or Lender under any liability to the Borrower. Nothing in
this Section 4.7 is intended to limit the right of the Borrower to make a claim
against an LC Issuer for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the first
sentence of Section 4.6.

         4.8      ACTIONS OF LC ISSUER.

         Each LC Issuer shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying, upon any Facility LC, draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and
other experts selected by such LC Issuer. Each LC Issuer shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless
it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders
as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.8, each LC Issuer
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and
such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon the Lenders and any future holders of a participation in any
Facility LC.

         4.9      INDEMNIFICATION.

         The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender
and LC Issuer and the Administrative Agent, and their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees from and against any and all claims and damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such Lender, LC Issuer or the
Administrative Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Lender, LC
Issuer or the Administrative Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in
connection with the issuance, execution and delivery or transfer of or payment
or failure to pay under any Facility LC or any actual or proposed use of any
Facility LC, including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses which an LC Issuer may incur by reason of or on
account of such LC Issuer issuing any Facility LC which specifies that the term
"Beneficiary" included therein includes any successor by operation of law of the
named

                                       48

<PAGE>

Beneficiary, but which Facility LC does not require that any drawing by any such
successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory
to such LC Issuer, evidencing the appointment of such successor Beneficiary;
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, LC
Issuer or the Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities,
costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (x) the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of an LC Issuer in determining whether a
request presented under any Facility LC complied with the terms of such Facility
LC or (y) an LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC after the
presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions
of such Facility LC. Nothing in this Section 4.9 is intended to limit the
obligations of the Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement.

         4.10     LENDERS' INDEMNIFICATION.

         Each Lender shall, ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share,
indemnify each LC Issuer, its affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower)
against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements),
claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from such
indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct or such LC Issuer's failure
to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly
complying with the terms and conditions of the Facility LC) that such
indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Section 4.10 or any
action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.

         4.11     FACILITY LC COLLATERAL ACCOUNT.

         The Borrower agrees that it will, upon the request of the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders and until the final expiration date
of any Facility LC and thereafter as long as any amount is payable to any LC
Issuer or Lender in respect of any Facility LC, maintain a special collateral
account pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent (the "Facility LC Collateral Account") at the Administrative Agent's
office at the address specified in or pursuant to Section 11.1, in the name of
such Borrower but under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative
Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and in which such Borrower shall have no
interest other than as set forth in Section 9.3. The Borrower hereby pledges,
assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable
benefit of the Lenders and LC Issuers, a security interest in all of the
Borrower's right, title and interest in and to all funds which may from time to
time be on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account to secure the prompt
and complete payment and performance of the Credit Party Obligations. The
Administrative Agent will invest any funds on deposit from time to time in the
Facility LC Collateral Account in certificates of deposit of the Administrative
Agent having a maturity not exceeding 30 days. Nothing in this Section 4.11
shall obligate the Administrative Agent to require the Borrower to deposit any
funds in the Facility LC Collateral Account or limit the right of the
Administrative Agent to release any funds held in the Facility LC Collateral
Account or obligate the Borrower to deposit any funds in the Facility LC
Collateral Account, in each case other than as required by Section 9.2, 9.3 or
9.4 (as applicable).

         4.12     RIGHTS AS A LENDER.

                                       49

<PAGE>

         In its capacity as a Lender, each LC Issuer shall have the same rights
and obligations as any other Lender.

         under ERISA to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.
         Neither the Borrower, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA
         Affiliate has received any notification pursuant to ERISA that any
         Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section
         4241 of ERISA), is insolvent (within the meaning of Section 4245 of
         ERISA), or has been terminated (within the meaning of Title IV of
         ERISA), and, to the best knowledge of such parties, no Multiemployer
         Plan is reasonably expected to be in reorganization, insolvent, or
         terminated.

         of fiduciary responsibility has occurred with respect to a Plan which
         has subjected or is reasonably expected to subject the Borrower or any
         of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate to any liability under
         Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
         Code, or under any agreement or other instrument pursuant to which the
         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has agreed
         or is required to indemnify any person against any such liability.

         welfare benefits to be provided to their current and former employees
         under Plans which are welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1)
         of ERISA), net of all assets under all such Plans allocable to such

time and from time to time by the Borrower by giving written notice thereof to
the Administrative Agent.

         6.16     USE OF PROCEEDS.

         The proceeds of the Loans hereunder will be used solely for the

of another Person unless the board of directors (or other comparable governing
body) or stockholders, as appropriate, of such Person has approved such
Acquisition.

         6.17     GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

                  (a)      No proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or
         indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin
         stock" within the meaning of Regulation U, or for the purpose of
         purchasing or carrying or trading in any securities. If requested by
         any Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to
         the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing
         effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to
         in Regulation U. No Indebtedness being reduced or retired out of the
         proceeds of the Loans was or will be incurred for the purpose of
         purchasing or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of
         Regulation U or any "margin security" within the meaning of Regulation
         T. "Margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U does not
         constitute more than 25% of the value of the consolidated assets of the
         Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries. None of the transactions
         contemplated by the Credit Documents (including, without limitation,
         the direct or indirect use of the proceeds of the Loans) will violate
         or result in a violation of (i) the Securities Act or (ii) the Exchange
         Act.

                  (b)      No Credit Party is subject to regulation under the
         Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act or
         the Investment Company Act of 1940, each as amended. In addition, no
         Credit Party is (i) an "investment company" registered or required to
         be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and
         is not controlled by an "investment company", or (ii) a "holding
         company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an
         "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary" of a "holding
         company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
         of 1935, as amended.

                  (c)      No director, executive officer or principal
         shareholder of any Credit Party is a director, executive officer or
         principal shareholder of any Lender. For the purposes hereof the terms
         "director", "executive officer" and "principal shareholder" (when used
         with reference to any Lender) have the respective meanings assigned
         thereto in Regulation O.

                                   SECTION 7

                             AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

         The Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that so long as this Credit
Agreement is in effect and until the Loans, together with interest and fees and
other obligations then due and payable hereunder, have been paid in full (other
than any such obligations which by the terms thereof are stated to survive
termination of the Credit Documents) and the Commitments hereunder shall have
terminated:

         7.1      INFORMATION COVENANTS.

         The Borrower will furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the
Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders:

                  (a)      Annual Financial Statements. As soon as available,
         and in any event within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year of
         the Borrower, a consolidated and consolidating balance sheet and income
         statement of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, as of the end of such
         fiscal year, together with related consolidated and consolidating
         statements of operations, retained earnings, shareholders equity and
         cash flows for such fiscal year, setting forth in comparative form
         consolidated and consolidating figures for the preceding fiscal year,
         all such financial information described above to be in reasonable form
         and detail and audited by independent certified public accountants of

         for changes with which such accountants concur) and shall not be
         limited as to the scope of the audit or qualified in any manner, except
         for qualifications resulting from changes in GAAP and required or
         approved by the Borrower's independent certified public accountants. It
         is specifically understood and agreed that failure of the annual
         financial statements to be accompanied by an opinion of such
         accountants in form and substance as provided herein shall constitute
         an Event of Default hereunder.

                  (b)      Quarterly Statements. As soon as available, and in
         any event within 60 days after the close of each fiscal quarter (other

         related consolidated and consolidating statements of operations,
         retained earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flow for such quarter,
         in each case setting forth in comparative form consolidated and
         consolidating figures for the corresponding period of the preceding
         fiscal year, all such financial information described above to be in
         reasonable form and detail and reasonably acceptable to the
         Administrative Agent and accompanied by a certificate of the chief
         financial officer of the Borrower to the effect that such consolidated
         and consolidating statements are true and correct and have been
         prepared in accordance with GAAP, subject to changes resulting from
         audit and normal year-end audit adjustments.

                  (c)      Officer's Certificate. At the time of delivery of the
         financial statements provided for in Sections 7.1(a) and 7.1(b) above,

         deliver financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as of the
         Closing Date, to the extent GAAP has changed since the Closing Date, in
         order to show compliance with the terms of this Credit Agreement,
         including Section 7.2. In addition, at the time of any Investment
         pursuant to clause (j) of the definition of Permitted Investments in
         excess of $10,000,000, a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the
         Borrower stating that after giving effect to such Investment on a pro
         forma basis no Default or Event of Default will exist or be continuing

                  (e)      Notices. Upon an executive officer of a Credit Party
         obtaining knowledge thereof, the Borrower will give written notice to
         the Administrative Agent (a) immediately of the occurrence of an event
         or condition consisting of a Default or Event of Default, specifying
         the nature and existence thereof and what action the Credit Parties
         propose to take with respect thereto, and (b) promptly, but in any
         event within five

                  (f)      ERISA. Upon any of the Credit Parties or any ERISA
         Affiliate obtaining knowledge thereof, the Borrower will give written
         notice to the Administrative Agent promptly (and in any event within

                  scope, form and depth, including, where appropriate, invasive

                  exercising jurisdiction over such Real Property to the extent

delinquent, (b) all lawful claims (including claims for labor, materials and
supplies) which, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien upon any of its
properties, and (c) all of its other Indebtedness as it shall become due (to the
extent such repayment is not otherwise prohibited by this Credit Agreement);
provided, however, that a Credit Party shall not be required to pay any such
tax, assessment, charge, levy, claim or Indebtedness which is being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which adequate reserves therefor
have been established in accordance with GAAP, unless the failure to make any
such payment (i) would give rise to an immediate right to foreclose or collect
on a Lien securing such amounts or (ii) would have or could be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.7      INSURANCE.

         Each of the Credit Parties will at all times maintain in full force and

to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.9      PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS.

         Each of the Credit Parties will perform in all material respects all of
its obligations under the terms of all material agreements, indentures,
mortgages, security agreements or other debt instruments to which it is a party
or by which it or its property is bound, unless the failure to do so would not
have or could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.10     USE OF PROCEEDS.

         The Credit Parties will use the proceeds/availability of the Loans
solely (a) to repay Indebtedness owing under the Existing Credit Agreement, (b)
to provide working capital for the Credit Parties and (c) for general corporate

         7.12     ADDITIONAL CREDIT PARTIES.

         At the time any Person becomes a Material Subsidiary of a Credit Party,
the Borrower shall so notify the Administrative Agent and promptly thereafter
(but in any event within 30 days after the date thereof or within such longer
period of time as agreed to by the Administrative Agent) shall cause such Person
to (a) execute a Supplemental Guaranty and (b) deliver to the Administrative
Agent such other documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably
request, including, without limitation, certified copies of resolutions and
other corporate, limited liability company or partnership documents and
favorable opinions of counsel to such Person, all in form, content and scope
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
and the Lenders agree that upon any Subsidiary (other than a REIT) ceasing to be
a Material

                                       67

except for Permitted Liens.

         8.3      NATURE OF BUSINESS.

         No Credit Party will materially alter the character of its business
from that conducted as of the Closing Date or engage in any business other than
the business conducted as of the Closing Date and activities which are
substantially similar or related thereto or logical extensions thereof.

                                       69

<PAGE>

                  (d)      the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent an
         opinion of counsel stating that such consolidation or merger and any

                  (d)      Other Credit Documents. (i) Any Credit Party shall

<PAGE>

                  the holder or holders of such Indebtedness (or trustee or
                  agent on behalf of such holders) to cause (determined without
                  regard to whether any notice or lapse of time is required) any
                  such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity;
                  (B) any such Indebtedness shall be declared due and payable,
                  or required to be prepaid other than by a regularly scheduled
                  required prepayment prior to the stated maturity thereof; or

         or not waived, shall exist with respect to any Plan, or any Lien shall

         ERISA Affiliate in favor of the PBGC or a Plan; (B) a Termination Event
         shall occur with respect to a Single Employer Plan, which is, in the
         reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, likely to result in the

         Termination Event shall occur with respect to a Multiemployer Plan or
         Multiple Employer Plan, which is, in the reasonable opinion of the

         Plan for purposes of Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) any Credit Party, any
         of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate incurring any liability in
         connection with a withdrawal from, reorganization of (within the
         meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), or insolvency (within the meaning of
         Section 4245 of ERISA) of such Plan; or (D) any prohibited transaction
         (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
         Code) or breach of fiduciary responsibility shall occur which may
         subject any Credit Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
         Affiliate to any liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l)
         of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or other
         instrument pursuant to which any Credit Party, any of its Subsidiaries
         or any ERISA Affiliate has agreed or is required to indemnify any
         person against any such liability.

                  (j)      Ownership. There shall occur a Change of Control.

         9.2      ACCELERATION; REMEDIES.

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
and at any time thereafter unless and until such Event of Default has been
waived in writing by the Required

                                       75
<PAGE>

Lenders (or the Lenders as may be required hereunder), the Administrative Agent
shall, upon the request and direction of the Required Lenders, by written notice
to the Borrower, take the following actions without prejudice to the rights of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or LC Issuer to enforce its claims
against the Credit Parties, except as otherwise specifically provided for
herein:

                  (a)      Termination of Commitments. Declare the Commitments
         terminated whereupon the Commitments and the obligation and power of
         the LC Issuers to issue Facility LCs shall be immediately terminated.

                  (b)      Acceleration of Loans. Declare the unpaid principal
         of and any accrued interest in respect of all Loans and any and all
         other indebtedness or obligations of any and every kind owing by a
         Credit Party to any of the Lenders hereunder to be due whereupon the
         same shall be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
         protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by
         the Borrower.

                  (c)      Facility LC Collateral Account. Demand that the
         Borrower pay, and the Borrower shall be and become thereby
         unconditionally obligated to pay, to the Administrative Agent an amount
         in immediately available funds, which funds shall be held in the
         Facility LC Collateral Account, equal to the difference of (x) the
         amount of Facility LC Obligations at such time, less (y) the amount (if
         any) on deposit in the LC Collateral Account at such time which is free
         and clear of all rights and claims of third parties and has not been
         applied against the Credit Party Obligations (such difference, the
         "Collateral Shortfall Amount").

                  (d)      Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and
         interests created and existing under the Credit Documents, including,
         without limitation, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and all
         rights of set-off.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in Section
9.1(f) shall occur, then (i) the Commitments and the obligation and power of the
LC Issuers to issue Facility LCs shall automatically terminate, (ii) all Loans,
all accrued interest in respect thereof, all accrued and unpaid fees and other
Credit Party Obligations shall immediately become due and payable and (iii) the
Borrower will also forthwith, and without any notice or act, pay to the
Administrative Agent the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which funds shall be
deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account, all without the giving of any
notice or other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, which notice
or other action is expressly waived by the Borrower.

Notwithstanding the fact that enforcement powers reside primarily with the
Administrative Agent, each Lender has, to the extent permitted by law, a
separate right of payment and shall be considered a separate "creditor" holding
a separate "claim" within the meaning of Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code
or any other insolvency statute.

                                       76

         9.3      FACILITY LC COLLATERAL ACCOUNT.

                  (a)      If at any time while any Event of Default is
         continuing, the Administrative Agent determines that the Collateral
         Shortfall Amount at such time is greater than zero, the Administrative
         Agent may, and at the direction of the Required Lenders shall, make
         demand on the Borrower to pay, and the Borrower will, forthwith upon
         such demand and without any further notice or act, pay to the
         Administrative Agent the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which funds shall
         be deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account.

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent may, at any time or from
         time to time after funds are deposited in the Facility LC Collateral
         Account, apply such funds to the payment of the Credit Party
         Obligations and any other amounts as shall from time to time have
         become due and payable by the Borrower to the Lenders or LC Issuers
         under the Credit Documents.

                  (c)      At any time while any Event of Default is continuing,
         neither the Borrower nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through
         the Borrower shall have any right to withdraw any of the funds held in
         the Facility LC Collateral Account. After all of the Credit Party
         Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments
         have been terminated and no Facility LCs remain outstanding, any funds
         remaining in the Facility LC Collateral Account shall be returned by
         the Administrative Agent to the Borrower or paid to whomever may be
         legally entitled thereto at such time.

                  (d)      If at any time at which funds are being held in the
         Facility LC Collateral Account there exists no Event of Default, or the
         Required Lenders (or the Lenders as may be required hereunder) have
         waived in writing any such Event of Default, the Administrative Agent
         shall, upon written request of the Borrower, return such funds to the
         Borrower.

         9.4      ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement, after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts
collected or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of
amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents shall be paid over or
delivered as follows:

                  FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or LC Issuers in
         connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders or LC Issuers under
         the Credit Documents;

                  SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative
         Agent or any Lender or LC Issuer;

                  THIRD, to the payment of all accrued interest payable to the
         Lenders hereunder and all other obligations (other than those
         obligations to be paid pursuant to clause "FOURTH" or clause "FIFTH"
         below) which shall have become due and payable under the Credit
         Documents and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" and "SECOND"
         above;

                                       77
<PAGE>

                  FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of
         the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, pro rata as set forth below;

                  FIFTH, to the Administrative Agent for deposit in the Facility
         LC Collateral Account to the extent of any Collateral Shortfall Amount;
         and

                  SIXTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever may
         be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, (a) amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category and (b) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to
its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans held
by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Loans) of amounts
available to be applied.

                                   SECTION 10

                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

         10.1     APPOINTMENT; NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP.

         Bank One is hereby appointed by each of the Lenders as its contractual
representative (herein referred to as the "Administrative Agent") hereunder and
under each other Credit Document, and each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes
the Administrative Agent to act as the contractual representative of such Lender
with the rights and duties expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit
Documents. The Administrative Agent agrees to act as such contractual
representative upon the express conditions contained in this Section 10.
Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Administrative Agent," it is
expressly understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall not have any
fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document and that the Administrative Agent is merely acting as the
contractual representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. In its
capacity as the Lenders' contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not
hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a
"representative" of the Lenders within the meaning of the term "secured party"
as defined in the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting as an
independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to those
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. Each of
the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on
any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty,
all of which claims each Lender hereby waives.

                                       78
<PAGE>

         10.2     POWERS.

         The Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under
the Credit Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent
by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent shall have no implied duties to the
Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except
any action specifically provided by the Credit Documents to be taken by the
Administrative Agent.

         10.3     GENERAL IMMUNITY.

         Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or any Lender
or LC Issuer for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it or
them hereunder or under any other Credit Document or in connection herewith or
therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person or from breach of such
Person's express obligations under this Agreement.

         10.4     NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOANS, RECITALS, ETC.

         Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain,
inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in
connection with any Credit Document or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any obligor
under any Credit Document, including, without limitation, any agreement by an
obligor to furnish information directly to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of
any condition specified in Section 5, except receipt of items required to be
delivered solely to the Administrative Agent; (d) the existence or possible
existence of any Event of Default or Default (other than an Event of Default
under Section 9.1(a)); (e) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness,
sufficiency or genuineness of any Credit Document or any other instrument or
writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation,
perfection or priority of any Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the
financial condition of the Borrower or any Guarantor or of any of the Borrower's
or any such Guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent shall
have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be
furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at such time, but is
voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent (either in its
capacity as Administrative Agent or in its individual capacity).

         10.5     ACTION ON INSTRUCTIONS OF LENDERS.

         The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Credit
Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders,
and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the
Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action
permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document unless

                                       79
<PAGE>

it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action hereunder and under any other Credit Document unless it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all
liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing
to take any such action.

         10.6     EMPLOYMENT OF AGENTS AND COUNSEL.

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties as
Administrative Agent hereunder and under any other Credit Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to advice of counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders and all matters pertaining to the
Administrative Agent's duties hereunder and under any other Credit Document.

         10.7     RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS; COUNSEL.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Note,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or
document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or
sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the
opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent, which counsel may be
employees of the Administrative Agent.

         10.8     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION.

         The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent
ratably in proportion of their respective Pro Rata Shares (i) for any amounts
not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to
reimbursement by the Borrower under the Credit Documents, (ii) for any other
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and
enforcement of the Credit Documents (including, without limitation, for any
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute
between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the
Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Credit
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in connection
with any dispute between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two
or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Credit
Documents or of any such other documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be
liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a
final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct

                                       80
<PAGE>

of the Administrative Agent and (ii) any indemnification required pursuant to
Section 3.13(b)(iv) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10.8,
be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof. The
obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the
Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         10.9     NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default or Default hereunder (other
than an Event of Default under Section 9.1(a)) unless the Administrative Agent
has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this
Agreement describing such Event of Default or Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default." In the event that the Administrative Agent
receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Lenders.

         10.10    RIGHTS AS A LENDER.

         In the event the Administrative Agent is a Lender, the Administrative
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Credit
Document with respect to its Commitments and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term
"Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Administrative Agent is a
Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent
in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust,
debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, with the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby
from engaging with any other Person.

         10.11    LENDER CREDIT DECISION.

         Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and
based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

         10.12    SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective
upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or, if no successor
Administrative Agent has been appointed, sixty (60) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign. The

                                       81
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by written
notice received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders, such
removal to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders, provided
that, as long as no Event of Default has occurred that is continuing, such
removal shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders
shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor Administrative Agent, provided that, as long as no Event of Default
has occurred that is continuing, the appointment of such successor
Administrative Agent shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no successor Administrative Agent shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within sixty (60) days after the
resigning Administrative Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then
the resigning Administrative Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and
the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent, provided that, as long as no
Event of Default has occurred that is continuing, the appointment of such
successor Administrative Agent shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower,
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, the Administrative Agent may at any time without the consent of the
Borrower or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank
as a successor Administrative Agent hereunder. If the Administrative Agent has
resigned or been removed and no successor Administrative Agent has been
appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations
to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the
Lenders. No successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be appointed
hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the
appointment. Any such successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank
having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor
Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the resigning or removed Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the resigning or removed
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the Credit Documents. After the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Section 10 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Credit Documents. In
the event that there is a successor to the Administrative Agent by merger, or
the Administrative Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate
pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this
Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the
new Administrative Agent.

         10.13    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND ARRANGER FEES.

         The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and the
Arranger, for their respective accounts, the fees agreed to by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Arranger pursuant to the Fee Letter or as otherwise
agreed from time to time.

                                       82
<PAGE>

         10.14    DELEGATION TO AFFILIATES.

         The Borrower and the Lenders agree that the Administrative Agent may
delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates. Any
such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents and employees)
which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the
same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other protective provisions to
which the Administrative Agent is entitled under Sections 10 and 11.

         10.15    AUTHORIZATION OF INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT.

         Each of the Lenders hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter
into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf and to carry out the
responsibilities and exercise the powers afforded the Administrative Agent
therein.

         10.16    DOCUMENTATION AGENT, SYNDICATION AGENT, ETC.

         None of the Lenders identified in this Agreement as a Documentation
Agent or Syndication Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all
Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have
or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender
hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes
with respect to the Administrative Agent in Section 10.11.

         10.17    BENEFITS OF SECTION 10.

         None of the provisions of this Section 10 shall inure to the benefit of
the Borrower or of any Person other than Administrative Agent and each of the
Lenders and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Accordingly,
neither the Borrower nor any Person other than Administrative Agent and the
Lenders (and their respective successors and permitted assigns) shall be
entitled to rely upon, or to raise as a defense, the failure of the
Administrative Agent or any Lenders to comply with the provisions of this
Section 10.

                                   SECTION 11

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         11.1     NOTICES.

         Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other
communications shall have been duly given and shall be effective (a) when
delivered in writing, (b) when transmitted via telecopy (or other facsimile
device) to the number set out below, (c) the Business Day following the day on
which the same has been delivered prepaid (or on an invoice basis) to a
reputable national overnight air courier service, or (d) the third Business Day
following the day on which the same is sent by certified or registered mail,
postage prepaid, in each case to the respective parties at the address or
telecopy numbers set forth on Schedule 11.1, or at such other address as such
party may specify by written notice to the other parties hereto.

         11.2     RIGHT OF SET-OFF.

         In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law
or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default and the commencement of remedies described in
Section 9.2, each Lender, and each Affiliate of such Lender, is authorized at
any time and from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind (all of which rights being hereby expressly waived), to
set-off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special)
and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender or its
Affiliates (including, without limitation, branches or agencies of such Lender
or its Affiliates wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of any
Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries against the Credit Party Obligations of
such Credit Party, irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders shall have made any demand hereunder and although such Credit Party
Obligations may be contingent or unmatured, and any such set-off shall be deemed
to have been made immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default even
though such charge is made or entered on the books of such Lender subsequent
thereto. The Borrower hereby agrees that any Person purchasing a participation
in the Loans and Commitments hereunder pursuant to Section 11.3(e) or 3.8 may
exercise all rights of set-off with respect to its participation interest as
fully as if such Person were a Lender hereunder.

         11.3     BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT.

                  (a)      Generally. This Credit Agreement shall be binding
         upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective
         successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided that none of the
         Credit Parties may assign and transfer any of its interests (except as
         permitted by Section 8.4 or 8.5) without the prior written consent of
         the Lenders; and provided further that the rights of each Lender to
         transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights and/or
         obligations hereunder shall be limited as set forth below in this
         Section 11.3.

                  (b)      Assignments. Each Lender may assign to one or more
         Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
         this Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion
         of its Loans, its Notes, and its Commitments); provided, however, that:

                           (i)      unless each of the Administrative Agent and
                  (as long as no Event of Default exists) Borrower otherwise
                  agrees, any such partial assignment shall be (A) in an amount
                  at least equal to $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
                  $1,000,000 in excess thereof or (B) in an amount equal to such
                  Lender's entire remaining Commitment;

                           (ii)     each such assignment by a Lender shall be of
                  a constant, and not varying, percentage of all of its rights
                  and obligations under this Credit Agreement and the Notes; and

                                       84
<PAGE>

                           (iii)    the parties to such assignment shall execute
                  and deliver to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance an
                  assignment agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit
                  11.3(b) (each an "Assignment Agreement"), together with a
                  processing fee from the assignor of $3,500.

         Upon execution, delivery, and acceptance of such Assignment Agreement,
         the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of
         such assignment, have the obligations, rights, and benefits of a Lender
         hereunder and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of such
         assignment, relinquish its rights (except its rights with respect to
         indemnification under the Credit Documents accruing prior to such
         assignment) and be released from its obligations under this Credit
         Agreement. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this
         Section 11.3(b), the assignor, the Administrative Agent and the
         Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, new
         Notes are issued to the assignor and the assignee. If the assignee is
         not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a
         state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of
         taxes in accordance with Section 3.13.

         By executing and delivering an Assignment Agreement in accordance with
         this Section 11.3(b), the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee
         thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and
         the other parties hereto as follows: (A) such assigning Lender warrants
         that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being
         assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and the assignee
         warrants that it is an Eligible Assignee; (B) except as set forth in
         clause (A) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or
         warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
         warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Credit
         Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or
         document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, or the execution,
         legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
         of this Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any
         other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or
         the financial condition of any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries
         or the performance or observance by any Credit Party of any of its
         obligations under this Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit
         Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto
         or thereto; (C) such assignee represents and warrants that it is
         legally authorized to enter into such Assignment Agreement; (D) such
         assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Credit Agreement,
         the other Credit Documents and such other documents and information as
         it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision
         to enter into such Assignment Agreement; (E) such assignee will
         independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such
         assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
         information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make
         its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
         Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents; (F) such assignee
         appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on
         its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Credit Agreement or
         any other Credit Document as are delegated to the Administrative Agent
         by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as are
         reasonably incidental thereto;

                                       85
<PAGE>

         and (G) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
         their terms all the obligations which by the terms of this Credit
         Agreement and the other Credit Documents are required to be performed
         by it as a Lender.

                  (c)      Register. The Administrative Agent shall maintain a
         copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a
         register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders
         and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each
         Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
         shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
         error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may
         treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender
         hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement. The Register shall
         be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
         reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d)      Acceptance. Upon its receipt of an Assignment
         Agreement executed by the parties thereto, together with any Note
         subject to such assignment and payment of the processing fee, the
         Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment Agreement has been
         completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit 11.3(b) hereto,
         (i) accept such Assignment Agreement, (ii) record the information
         contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof
         to the parties thereto.

                  (e)      Participations. Each Lender may sell participations
         to one or more Persons in all or a portion of its rights, obligations
         or rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or
         a portion of its Commitments and its Loans); provided, however, that
         (i) such Lender's obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain
         unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
         other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the
         participant shall be entitled to the benefit of the yield protection
         provisions contained in Sections 3.9 through 3.14, inclusive, and the
         right of set-off contained in Section 11.2, (iv) the Borrower shall
         continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
         with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement,
         and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the obligations
         of the Borrower relating to its Loans and its Notes and to approve any
         amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Credit
         Agreement (other than amendments, modifications, or waivers decreasing
         the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on
         such Loans or Notes, extending any scheduled principal payment date or
         date fixed for the payment of interest on such Loans or Notes or fees
         (other than Administrative Fees) (other than as a result of the
         extension of the Maturity Date in accordance with the terms of Section
         2.5), postponing the expiry date of any Facility LC beyond the Maturity
         Date, extending its Commitments or releasing all or substantially all
         of the Guarantors) and (v) such Lender shall provide written notice of
         any participation to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                  (f)      Nonrestricted Assignments. Notwithstanding any other
         provision set forth in this Credit Agreement, any Lender may at any
         time assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to
         any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to

                                       86
<PAGE>

         Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve
         Bank. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its
         obligations hereunder.

                  (g)      Information. Any Lender may furnish any information
         concerning the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of
         such Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including
         prospective assignees and participants), subject, however, to the
         provisions of Section 11.16.

         11.4     NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

         No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries and the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or
any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in
any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand.

         11.5     PAYMENT OF EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.

         The Borrower agrees to: (a) pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of (i) the Administrative Agent and Arranger in connection with (A) the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery, syndication and administration
of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the documents and
instruments referred to therein, and (B) any amendment, waiver or consent
relating hereto and thereto including, but not limited to, any such amendments,
waivers or consents resulting from or related to any work-out, renegotiation or
restructure relating to the performance by the Credit Parties under this Credit
Agreement (including, without limitation, in the case of either (A) or (B)
above, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Administrative Agent,
who may or may not be employees of the Administrative Agent) and (ii) the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with (A) enforcement and
collection of the Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred to
therein, including, without limitation, in connection with any such enforcement,
the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent,
who may or may not be employees of the Administrative Agent and each of the
Lenders, and (B) any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of a Credit Party or
any of its Subsidiaries and (b) indemnify the Administrative Agent, Arranger,
each Lender and each of their officers, directors, employees, representatives,
Affiliates and agents from and hold each of them harmless against any and all
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel (including the allocated cost
of internal counsel) and settlement costs incurred by any of them as a result
of, or arising out of, or in any way related to, or by reason of, any
investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not the Administrative
Agent, Arranger or any Lender is a party thereto) related to (i) the entering
into

                                       87
<PAGE>

and/or performance of any Credit Document or the use of proceeds of any Loans
(including other Extensions of Credit) hereunder or the consummation of any
other transactions contemplated in any Credit Document, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in
connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding, (ii) any
Environmental Claim, (iii) any claims for Non-Excluded Taxes (but excluding in
the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, any such losses, liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by reason of gross negligence
or willful misconduct on the part of the Person to be indemnified).

         11.6     AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS.

         Subject to Section 11.16(b), neither this Credit Agreement nor any
other Credit Document nor any of the terms hereof or thereof may be amended,
changed, waived, discharged or terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver,
discharge or termination is in writing and signed by the Required Lenders and
the Credit Parties that are parties to the Credit Document being amended,
changed or terminated or with respect to which such waiver or discharge is being
given; provided that no such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination
shall without the consent of each Lender affected thereby:

         of the Extension Required Lenders pursuant to Section 2.5) or extend

                  (b)      reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
         interest or fees hereunder (it being understood and agreed that a
         waiver of the applicability of any post-default increase in interest
         rates shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest for
         purposes of this clause (b));

                  (c)      reduce or waive the principal amount, or extend the
         date for payment of any Loan or any Reimbursement Obligation;

         being understood and agreed that a waiver of any Default or Event of
         Default or a waiver of any mandatory reduction in the Commitments or
         any increase in the Revolving Committed Amount pursuant to Section
         2.1(e) shall not constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment of
         any Lender);

                  (e)      except as the result of or in connection with a
         merger or other disposition of a Credit Party permitted under Section
         8.4, (i) release the Borrower from its obligations under the Credit
         Documents or (ii) release any Credit Party that individually or,
         together with any other Credit Party previously released or to be
         released simultaneously therewith, cumulatively accounts for more than
         5% of Tangible Net Worth from its obligations under the Credit
         Documents;

         11.6 or Section 3.4(a), 3.4(b), 3.7, 3.8, 5.1, 5.2, 9.1(a), 11.2, 11.3

         or all or substantially all of the other Credit Parties of any of its
         or their rights and obligations under (or in respect of) the Credit
         Documents except as permitted thereby.

without the consent of the Administrative Agent. No provision affecting the
Swingline Loans may be amended or modified without the consent of the Swingline
Lender. No provision affecting an LC Issuer may be amended or modified without
its consent.

Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is required in
certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is entitled to vote as
such Lender sees fit on any reorganization plan that affects the Loans, LC
Obligations or any other Credit Party Obligations and each Lender acknowledges
that the provisions of Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the
unanimous consent provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders may
consent to allow a Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

         11.7     COUNTERPARTS/TELECOPY.

         This Credit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which where so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of executed
counterparts by telecopy shall be as effective as an original and shall
constitute a representation that an original will be delivered.

         11.8     HEADINGS.

         The headings of the sections and subsections hereof are provided for
convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of
any provision of this Credit Agreement.

         11.9     DEFAULTING LENDER.

         Each Lender understands and agrees that if such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender then notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.6 it shall not be
entitled to vote on any matter requiring the consent of the Required Lenders or
to object to any matter (other than those provided for in Section 11.6(b), (c)
and (d)) requiring the consent of all the Lenders; provided, however, that all
other benefits and obligations under the Credit Documents shall apply to such
Defaulting Lender.

         11.13    SEVERABILITY.

         If any provision of any of the Credit Documents is determined to be

provisions.

supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any,
including any commitment letters or correspondence relating to the Credit
Documents or the transactions contemplated herein and therein.

         11.16    CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential information which it may
receive from the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement in confidence, except for
disclosure (i) to its Affiliates and to other Lenders and their respective

Lender (and each employee, representative or other agent of any Lender) may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or
have been provided to such Lender relating to such tax treatment or tax
structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in
either case contains information concerning such tax treatment or tax structure
of the transactions contemplated hereby as well as other information, this

                                       91
<PAGE>

sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that
relate to such tax treatment or tax structure.

         11.17    BINDING EFFECT; CONTINUING AGREEMENT.

                  (a)      This Credit Agreement shall become effective at such
         time when all of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 have been
         satisfied or waived by the Lenders and it shall have been executed by
         the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent
         shall have received copies hereof (telefaxed or otherwise) which, when
         taken together, bear the signatures of each Lender, and thereafter this
         Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
         Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and their respective
         successors and assigns.

                  (b)      This Credit Agreement shall be a continuing agreement
         and shall remain in full force and effect until all Loans, interest,
         fees and other Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full and all
         Commitments have been terminated. Upon termination, the Credit Parties
         shall have no further obligations (other than the indemnification
         provisions that survive) under the Credit Documents; provided that
         should any payment, in whole or in part, of the Credit Party
         Obligations be rescinded or otherwise required to be restored or
         returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether as a result
         of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, then
         the Credit Documents shall automatically be reinstated and all amounts
         required to be restored or returned and all costs and expenses incurred
         by the Administrative Agent or Lender in connection therewith shall be
         deemed included as part of the Credit Party Obligations.

                  11.18    NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

         Each party hereto waives any claim for consequential damages by reason
of the breach of any provision of the Credit Documents by any other party.

                               SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY

         THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY (this "Guaranty") is made as of the
___________ day of ___________, ____, by the undersigned (collectively, the
"Subsidiary Guarantors") in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit
of the Lenders, under the Credit Agreement referred to below.

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, Pulte Homes, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the "Principal"),
and Bank One, NA, a national banking association having its principal office in
Chicago, Illinois, as Administrative Agent, and certain other Lenders from time
to time party thereto have entered into a certain Credit Agreement dated
_________________, 2003 (as same may be amended or modified from time to time,
the "Credit Agreement"), providing, subject to the terms and conditions thereof,
for extensions of credit to be made by the Lenders to the Principal;

         WHEREAS, the Credit Agreement requires that each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors execute and deliver this Guaranty whereby each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors shall guarantee the payment when due, subject to Section 10 hereof,
of all Guaranteed Obligations, as defined below; and

         WHEREAS, in consideration of the financial and other support that the
Principal has provided, and such financial and other support as the Principal
may in the future provide, to the Subsidiary Guarantors, and because each
Subsidiary Guarantor has determined that executing this Guaranty is in its
interest and to its financial benefit, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is
willing to guarantee the obligations of the Principal under the Credit
Agreement, any Note and the other Credit Documents;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1.       Defined Terms. "Guaranteed Obligations" is defined in Section
4 below. Other capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have
the meaning set forth in the Credit Agreement.

         2.       Representations and Warranties. Each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors represents and warrants (which representations and warranties shall
be deemed to have been renewed upon each Extension of Credit under the Credit
Agreement) that:

         (a)      It (i) is a corporation, partnership or limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the state (or other jurisdiction) of its organization, (ii) is duly qualified
and in good standing as a foreign entity and authorized to do

                                       1
<PAGE>

business in every jurisdiction unless the failure to be so qualified, in good
standing or authorized would not have or could not be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) has the requisite power and authority
to own its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted.

         (b)      It (i) has the requisite power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform this Guaranty and any other Credit Document to which it is a
party and to incur the obligations herein and therein provided for and (ii) is
duly authorized to, and has been authorized by all necessary action, to execute,
deliver and perform this Guaranty and any other Credit Document to which it is a
party.

         (c)      Neither the execution and delivery of the Credit Documents,
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor performance
of and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof by it (i) violate or
conflict with any provision of its articles or certificate of incorporation or
bylaws, (ii) violate, contravene or materially conflict with any Requirement of
Law or any other law, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation D,
O, T, U or X), order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or permit applicable to
it, (iii) violate, contravene or conflict with contractual provisions of, or
cause an event of default under, any indenture, loan agreement, mortgage, deed
of trust, contract or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by
which it may be bound, the violation of which would have or could be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) result in or require the
creation of any Lien (other than those contemplated in or created in connection
with the Credit Documents) upon or with respect to its properties.

         (d)      Except for consents, approvals and authorizations which have
been obtained, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing,
registration or qualification with, any court or Governmental Authority or third
party is required in connection with its execution, delivery or performance of
this Guaranty and any other Credit Agreement to which it is a party.

         3.       Covenants. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors covenants that,
so long as any Lender has any Commitment outstanding under the Credit Agreement
or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall remain unpaid, that it will, and, if
necessary, will enable the Principal to, fully comply with those covenants and
agreements set forth in the Credit Agreement.

         4.       The Guaranty. Subject to Section 10 hereof, each of the
Subsidiary Guarantors hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as
primary obligor and not as surety, the full and punctual payment (whether at
stated maturity, upon acceleration or early termination or otherwise, and at all
times thereafter) and performance of the Credit Party Obligations, including
without limitation any such Credit Party Obligations incurred or accrued during
the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar
proceeding, whether or not allowed or allowable in such proceeding
(collectively, subject to the provisions of Section 10 hereof, being referred to
collectively as the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Upon failure by the Principal to
pay punctually any such amount, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that it
shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders and, if applicable, their Affiliates, the amount not so paid at the
place and in the manner specified in the Credit

                                       2
<PAGE>

Agreement, any Note or the relevant Credit Document, as the case may be. This
Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. Each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors waives any right to require the Lenders or the Administrative Agent
to sue the Principal, any other guarantor, or any other person obligated for all
or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or otherwise to enforce its payment
against any collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.

         5.       Guaranty Unconditional. Subject to Section 10 hereof, the
obligations of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be
unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by:

                  (a)      any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise,
         waiver or release in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by
         operation of law or otherwise, or any obligation of any other guarantor
         of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any default, failure or delay,
         willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of the Guaranteed
         Obligations;

                  (b)      any modification or amendment of or supplement to the
         Credit Agreement, any Note or any other Credit Document;

                  (c)      any release, nonperfection or invalidity of any
         direct or indirect security for any obligation of the Principal under
         the Credit Agreement, any Note, any Collateral Document, any other
         Credit Document, or any obligations of any other guarantor of any of
         the Guaranteed Obligations, or any action or failure to act by the
         Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender with
         respect to any collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed
         Obligations;

                  (d)      any change in the corporate or other legal existence,
         structure or ownership of the Principal or any other guarantor of any
         of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any insolvency, bankruptcy,
         reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Principal, or
         any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, or its assets or any
         resulting release or discharge of any obligation of the Principal, or
         any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

                  (e)      the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights
         which the Subsidiary Guarantors may have at any time against the
         Principal, any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
         the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in
         connection herewith or any unrelated transactions;

                  (f)      any invalidity or unenforceability relating to any
         other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, for any reason
         related to the Credit Agreement, any Note on any other Credit Document,
         or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit
         the payment by any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, of
         the principal of or interest on any Note or any other amount payable
         under the Credit Agreement, any Note or any other Credit Document; or

                                       3
<PAGE>

                  (g)      any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind
         by the Principal, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations,
         the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other
         circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this
         paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of any Subsidiary
         Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Subsidiary Guarantors do not waive defenses
to the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to the Principal, except for
such defenses as may arise by reason of any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding affecting the Principal.

         6.       Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full: Reinstatement In Certain
Circumstances. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors' obligations hereunder shall
remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations shall have been
indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments under the Credit Agreement shall
have terminated or expired. If at any time any payment of the principal of or
interest on any Note or any other amount payable by the Principal or any other
party under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document is rescinded or
must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Principal or otherwise, each of the Subsidiary Guarantor's
obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though
such payment had been due but not made at such time.

         7.       Waivers. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors irrevocably waives
acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement
that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the Principal, any
other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other Person.

         8.       Subrogation. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees
not to assert any right, claim or cause of action, including, without
limitation, a claim for subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or
otherwise, against the Principal arising out of or by reason of this Guaranty or
the obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the payment or
securing or purchasing of any of the Guaranteed Obligations by any of the
Subsidiary Guarantors unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations are
indefeasibly paid in full, and any commitment to lend under the Credit Agreement
and any other Credit Documents is terminated or has expired.

         9.       Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy
or reorganization of the Principal, all such amounts otherwise subject to
acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, any Note or any other
Credit Document shall nonetheless be payable by each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent made at the
request of the Required Lenders.

         10.      Limitation on Obligations. (i) The provisions of this Guaranty
are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate
law, or any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if

                                       4
<PAGE>

the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty would otherwise
be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of
the amount of such Subsidiary Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, then,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the amount
of such liability shall, without any further action by the Subsidiary
Guarantors, the Administrative Agent or any Lender, be automatically limited and
reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in
such action or proceeding (such highest amount determined hereunder being the
relevant Subsidiary Guarantor's "Maximum Liability"). This Section 10(a) with
respect to the Maximum Liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors is intended solely
to preserve the rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder to the maximum
extent not subject to avoidance under applicable law, and neither the Subsidiary
Guarantor nor any other person or entity shall have any right or claim under
this Section 10(a) with respect to the Maximum Liability, except to the extent
necessary so that the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall
not be rendered voidable under applicable law.

                  (a)      Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that the
         Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the
         Maximum Liability of each Subsidiary Guarantor, and may exceed the
         aggregate Maximum Liability of all other Subsidiary Guarantors, without
         impairing this Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the
         Administrative Agent hereunder. Nothing in this Section 10(b) shall be
         construed to increase any Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder
         beyond its Maximum Liability.

                  (b)      In the event any Subsidiary Guarantor (a "Paying
         Subsidiary Guarantor") shall make any payment or payments under this
         Guaranty or shall suffer any loss as a result of any realization upon
         any collateral granted by it to secure its obligations under this
         Guaranty, each other Subsidiary Guarantor (each a "Non-Paying
         Subsidiary Guarantor") shall contribute to such Paying Subsidiary
         Guarantor an amount equal to such Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's
         "Pro Rata Share" of such payment or payments made, or losses suffered,
         by such Paying Subsidiary Guarantor. For the purposes hereof, each
         Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's "Pro Rata Share" with respect to any
         such payment or loss by a Paying Subsidiary Guarantor shall be
         determined as of the date on which such payment or loss was made by
         reference to the ratio of (i) such Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's
         Maximum Liability as of such date (without giving effect to any right
         to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder) or, if
         such Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's Maximum Liability has not been
         determined, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such
         Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor from the Principal after the date
         hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means) to (ii)
         the aggregate Maximum Liability of all Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder
         (including such Paying Subsidiary Guarantor) as of such date (without
         giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any
         contribution hereunder), or to the extent that a Maximum Liability has
         not been determined for any Subsidiary Guarantors, the aggregate amount
         of all monies received by such Subsidiary Guarantors from the Principal
         after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other
         means). Nothing in this Section 10(c) shall affect any Subsidiary
         Guarantor's several liability for the entire amount of the

                                       5
<PAGE>

         Guaranteed Obligations (up to such Subsidiary Guarantor's Maximum
         Liability). Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors covenants and agrees that
         its right to receive any contribution under this Guaranty from a
         Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in
         right of payment to all the Guaranteed Obligations. The provisions of
         this Section 10(c) are for the benefit of both the Administrative Agent
         and the Subsidiary Guarantors and may be enforced by any one, or more,
         or all of them in accordance with the terms hereof.

         11.      Application of Payments. All payments received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations in the order of priority set forth in
Section 9.4 of the Credit Agreement unless a court of competent jurisdiction
shall otherwise direct.

         12.      Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be given or made by telecopier or other writing and
telecopied, or mailed or delivered to the intended recipient at its address or
telecopier number set forth on the signature pages hereof or such other address
or telecopy number as such party may hereafter specify for such purpose by
notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section
11.1 of the Credit Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this Guaranty, all
such communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when transmitted by
telecopier, or personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice sent by
certified mail return-receipt requested, on the date set forth on the receipt
(provided, that any refusal to accept any such notice shall be deemed to be
notice thereof as of the time of any such refusal), in each case given or
addressed as aforesaid.

         13.      No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in this Guaranty, the Credit
Agreement, any Note and the other Credit Documents shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

         14.      No Duty to Advise. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors assumes
all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Principal's
financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the
risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and
extent of the risks that each of the Subsidiary Guarantors assumes and incurs
under this Guaranty, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any
Lender has any duty to advise any of the Subsidiary Guarantors of information
known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.

         15.      Successors and Assigns. This Guaranty is for the benefit of
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and in the event of an assignment of any amounts payable under
the Credit Agreement, any Note, or the other Credit Documents, the rights
hereunder, to the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, shall be
transferred with such indebtedness. This Guaranty shall be binding upon each of
the Subsidiary Guarantors and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

                                       6
<PAGE>

         16.      Changes in Writing. Neither this Guaranty nor any provision
hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only in
writing signed by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Administrative Agent
with the consent of the Required Lenders.

         17.      Costs of Enforcement. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees
to pay all costs and expenses including, without limitation, all court costs and
attorneys' fees and expenses paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender in endeavoring to collect all or any part
of the Guaranteed Obligations from, or in prosecuting any action against, the
Principal, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any other guarantor of all or any part
of the Guaranteed Obligations.

         18.      GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL. THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAW OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. EACH OF THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS HEREBY SUBMITS
TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS AND OF ANY ILLINOIS STATE COURT SITTING IN
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS AND FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OF THE OTHER
CREDIT DOCUMENTS) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH OF THE
SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH ANY OF THEM MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF
THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY
SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM. EACH OF THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE
LENDERS ACCEPTING THIS GUARANTY, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
GUARANTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         19.      Setoff. Without limiting the rights of the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders under applicable law, if all or any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations is then due, whether pursuant to the occurrence of an Event of
Default or otherwise, then the Guarantor authorizes the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders to apply any sums standing to the credit of the Guarantor with the
Administrative Agent or any Lender of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
toward the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

         20.      Taxes, etc. All payments required to be made by any of the
Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and
free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties or other charges of whatsoever
nature imposed by any government or any political or taxing authority thereof
(excluding federal taxation of the overall income of any Lender), provided,
however, that if any of the Subsidiary Guarantors is required by law to make
such deduction or

                                       7
<PAGE>

withholding, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall forthwith (i) pay to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, such additional amount as
results in the net amount received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as
applicable, equaling the full amount which would have been received by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, had no such deduction or
withholding been made, (ii) pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iii) furnish to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, certified copies of official
receipts evidencing payment of such withholding taxes within 30 days after such
payment is made.

         21.      Supplemental Guarantors. Pursuant to Section 7.12 of the
Credit Agreement, additional Subsidiaries shall become obligated as Subsidiary
Guarantors hereunder (each as fully as though an original signatory hereto) by
executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a supplemental guaranty in
the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (with blanks appropriately filled in).

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors has caused this Guaranty
to be duly executed, under seal, by its authorized officer as of the day and
year first above written.

                             Terms of Subordination

2.1      Subordination.

         (a)      Each of the Subordinated Creditors agrees, for itself and each
future holder of the Subordinated Obligations held by such Subordinated
Creditor, that the Subordinated Obligations are expressly subordinate and junior
in right of payment (as defined in subsection 2.1(b)) to all Senior Obligations
in all respects.

         (b)      "Subordinate and junior in right of payment" shall mean that:

                  (i)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
         Event of Default, none of the Subordinated Creditors will, without the
         express prior written consent of the Senior Creditors or unless
         otherwise instructed by the Senior Creditors, take, demand or receive,

         any action to enforce or collect, or otherwise exercise any rights or
         remedies it may possess with respect to the Subordinated Obligations or
         any portion thereof, or take any action to enforce or otherwise
         exercise any rights or remedies with respect to, or realize upon, the
         Collateral, in each case without the prior written consent of the
         Senior Creditors.

                  (iii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 2.1, in the event of any liquidation,
         termination, revocation or other winding-up of a Note Issuer, or in the
         event of any receivership, insolvency, reorganization or bankruptcy
         proceedings, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any proceeding
         by or against a Note Issuer for any relief under any bankruptcy,

         Default, unless otherwise agreed to or instructed in writing by the
         Senior Creditors, all Senior Obligations shall first be paid in full
         before any payment or distribution is made in respect of the
         Subordinated Obligations, and any payment or distribution of any kind
         or character (whether in cash, property or securities) that, but for
         the subordination provisions contained herein, would otherwise be
         payable or deliverable to a Subordinated Creditor upon or in respect of
         the Subordinated Obligations, shall instead be paid over or delivered
         to the Senior Creditors or their representatives, and such Subordinated
         Creditor shall not receive any such payment or distribution or any
         benefit therefrom unless and until the Senior Obligations shall have
         been fully paid and satisfied.

2.2      Power of Attorney; Agreement to Cooperate. Each of the Subordinated
Creditors hereby agrees, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to duly and
promptly take such action as may

                                       3
<PAGE>

be requested at any time and from time to time by the Senior Creditors, to file
appropriate proofs of claim in respect of the Subordinated Obligations, and to
execute and deliver such powers of attorney, assignment of proofs of claim or
other instruments as may be requested by the Senior Creditors in order to enable
the Senior Creditors to enforce any and all claims upon or in respect of the
Subordinated Obligations and to collect and receive any and all payments or
distributions which may be payable or deliverable at any time upon or in respect
of the Subordinated Obligations.

2.3      Payments Received by a Subordinated Creditor. Should any payment or

                              ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

         This Assignment Agreement (this "Assignment Agreement") between
_____________ (the "Assignor") and __________________ (the "Assignee") is dated
as of _____________, 200_. The parties hereto agree as follows:

         1. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT. The Assignor is a party to a Credit Agreement
(which, as it may be amended, modified, renewed or extended from time to time,
is herein called the "Credit Agreement") described in Item 1 of Schedule 1
attached hereto ("Schedule 1"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Credit
Agreement.

         2. ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION. The Assignor hereby sells and assigns to
the Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the Assignor,
an interest in and to the Assignor's rights and obligations under the Credit
Agreement such that after giving effect to such assignment the Assignee shall
have purchased pursuant to this Assignment Agreement the percentage interest
specified in Item 3 of Schedule 1 of all outstanding rights and obligations
under the Credit Agreement relating to the facilities listed in Item 3 of
Schedule 1 and the other Credit Documents. The Commitment (or Loans, if the
Commitment has been terminated) purchased by the Assignee hereunder is set forth
in Item 3 of Schedule 1.

         3. EFFECTIVE DATE. The effective date of this Assignment Agreement (the
"Effective Date") shall be the later of the date specified in Item 3 of Schedule
1 or two Business Days (or such shorter period agreed to by the Agent) after a
Notice of Assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 attached hereto has
been delivered to the Agent. Such Notice of Assignment must include any consents
required to be delivered to the Agent by Section 11.13 of the Credit Agreement
(including the consent of the Agent). In no event will the Effective Date occur
if the payments required to be made by the Assignee to the Assignor on the
Effective Date under Sections 4 and 5 hereof are not made on the proposed
Effective Date. The Assignor will notify the Assignee of the proposed Effective
Date no later than the Business Day prior to the proposed Effective Date. As of
the Effective Date, (i) the Assignee shall have the rights and obligations of a
Lender under the Credit Documents with respect to the rights and obligations
assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (ii) the Assignor shall relinquish its
rights and be released from its corresponding obligations under the Credit
Documents with respect to the rights and obligations assigned to the Assignee
hereunder.

         4. PAYMENTS, OBLIGATIONS. On and after the Effective Date, the Assignee
shall be entitled to receive from the Agent all payments of principal, interest
and fees with respect to the interest assigned hereby. The Assignee shall
advance funds directly to the Agent with respect to all Loans and reimbursement
payments made on or after the Effective Date with respect to the interest
assigned hereby. [In consideration for the sale and assignment of Loans
hereunder, (i) the Assignee shall pay the Assignor on the Effective Date, an
amount equal to the principal amount of the portion of all Floating Rate Loans
assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (ii) with respect to each Eurodollar Loan
made by the Assignor and assigned to the

                                       1
<PAGE>

Assignee hereunder which is outstanding on the Effective Date, (a) on the last
day of the Interest Period therefor or (b) on such earlier date agreed to by the
Assignor and the Assignee or (c) on the date on which any such Eurodollar Loan
either becomes due (by acceleration or otherwise) or is prepaid (the date as
described in the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c) being hereinafter referred to
as the "Payment Date"), the Assignee shall pay the Assignor an amount equal to
the principal amounts of the portion of such Eurodollar Loan assigned to the
Assignee which is outstanding on the Payment Date. If the Assignor and the
Assignee agree that the Payment Date for such Eurodollar Loan shall be the
Effective Date, they shall agree to the interest rate applicable to the portion
of such Loan assigned hereunder for the period from the Effective Date to the
end of the existing Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan (the
"Agreed Interest Rate") and any interest received by the Assignee in excess of
the Agreed Interest Rate shall be remitted to the Assignor. In the event
interest for the period from the Effective Date to but not including the Payment
Date is not paid by the Borrower with respect to any Eurodollar Loan sold by the
Assignor to the Assignee hereunder, the Assignee shall pay to the Assignor
interest for such period on the portion of such Eurodollar Loan sold by the
Assignor to the Assignee hereunder at the applicable rate provided by the Credit
Agreement. In the event a prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan which is existing on
the Payment Date and assigned by the Assignor to the Assignee hereunder occurs
after the Payment Date but before the end of the Interest Period applicable to
such Eurodollar Loan, the Assignee shall remit to the Assignor the excess of the
prepayment penalty paid with respect to the portion of such Eurodollar Loan
assigned to the Assignee hereunder over the amount which would have been paid if
such prepayment penalty was calculated based on the Agreed Interest Rate. The
Assignee will also promptly remit to the Assignor (i) any principal payments
received from the Administrative Agent with respect to Eurodollar Loans prior to
the Payment Date and (ii) any amounts of interest on Loans and fees received
from the Administrative Agent which relate to the portion of the Loans assigned
to the Assignee hereunder for periods prior to the Effective Date, in the case
of Floating Rate Loans, or the Payment Date, in the case of Eurodollar Loans,
and not previously paid by the Assignee to the Assignor.]* In the event that
either party hereto receives any payment to which the other party hereto is
entitled under this Assignment Agreement, then the party receiving such amount
shall promptly remit it to the other party hereto.

*THE PARTIES MAY INSERT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROVISIONS IN LIEU OF THE PAYMENT
TERMS INCLUDED IN THIS EXHIBIT.

         5. FEES PAYABLE BY THE ASSIGNEE. [To the extent applicable, the
Assignee shall pay to the Assignor a fee on each day on which a payment of
interest or commitment fee is made under the Credit Agreement with respect to
the amounts assigned to the Assignee hereunder (other than a payment of interest
or commitment fee for the period prior to the Effective Date or, in the case of
Eurodollar Loans, the Payment Date, which the Assignee is obligated to deliver
to the Assignor pursuant to Section 4 hereof). The amount of such fee shall be
the difference between (i) the interest or fee, as applicable, paid with respect
to the amounts assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (ii) the interest or fee,
as applicable, which would have been paid with respect to the amounts assigned
to the Assignee hereunder if each interest rate was ___ of 1% less than the
interest rate paid by the Borrower or if the commitment fee was _____ of 1% less
than the commitment fee paid by the Borrower, as applicable. In addition, the
