         by Company.

                                    (iv)     With respect to any Swing Line
         Loans which have not been voluntarily prepaid by Company pursuant to
         Section 2.13, Swing Line Lender may at any time in its sole and
         absolute discretion, deliver to Administrative Agent (with a copy to
         Company), no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least one
         (1) Business Day in advance of the proposed Credit Date, a notice
         (which shall be deemed to be a Funding Notice given by Company)
         requesting that each Lender holding a Revolving Commitment make
         Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to Company on such Credit Date
         in an amount equal to the amount of such Swing Line Loans (the
         "REFUNDED SWING LINE LOANS") outstanding on the date such notice is
         given which the Swing Line Lender requests Lenders to prepay. Anything
         contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (1) the
         proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by the Lenders other than Swing
         Line Lender shall be immediately delivered by Administrative Agent to
         Swing Line Lender (and not to Company) and applied to repay a
         corresponding portion of the Refunded Swing Line Loans and (2) on the
         day such Revolving Loans are made, Swing Line Lender's Pro Rata Share
         of the Refunded Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the
         proceeds of a Revolving Loan made by Swing Line Lender to Company, and
         such portion of the Swing Line Loans deemed to be so paid shall no
         longer be outstanding as Swing Line Loans and shall no longer be due
         under the Swing Line Note of Swing Line Lender but shall instead
         constitute part of Swing Line Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans to
         Company and shall be due under the Revolving Loan Note issued by
         Company to Swing Line Lender. Company hereby authorizes Administrative
         Agent and Swing Line Lender to charge Company's accounts with
         Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender (up to the amount available
         in each such account) in order to immediately pay Swing Line Lender the
         amount of the Refunded Swing Line Loans to the extent the proceeds of
         such Revolving Loans made by Lenders, including the Revolving Loan
         deemed to be made by the Swing Line Lender, are not sufficient to repay
         in full the Refunded Swing Line Loans. If any portion of any such
         amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to Swing Line Lender should be
         recovered by or on behalf of Company from Swing Line Lender in
         bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise,
         the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all
         Lenders in the manner contemplated by Section 2.17.

                                    (v)      If for any reason Revolving Loans
         are not made pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(iv) in an amount sufficient to
         repay any amounts owed to Swing Line Lender in respect of any
         outstanding Swing Line Loans on or before the third Business Day after
         demand for payment thereof by Swing Line Lender, each Lender holding a
         Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have
         purchased a participation in such outstanding Swing Line Loans, and in
         an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the applicable unpaid amount
         together with accrued interest thereon. Upon one (1) Business Day's
         notice from Swing Line Lender, each Lender holding a Revolving
         Commitment

         shall deliver to Swing Line Lender an amount equal to its respective
         participation in the applicable unpaid amount in same day funds at the
         Principal Office of Swing Line Lender. In order to evidence such
         participation each Lender holding a Revolving Commitment agrees to
         enter into a participation agreement at the request of Swing Line
         Lender in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Swing Line
         Lender. In the event any Lender holding a Revolving Commitment fails to
         make available to Swing Line Lender the amount of such Lender's
         participation as provided in this paragraph, Swing Line Lender shall be
         entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together
         with interest thereon for three Business Days at the rate customarily
         used by Swing Line Lender for the correction of errors among banks and
         thereafter at the Base Rate, as applicable.

                                    (vi)     Notwithstanding anything contained
         herein to the contrary, (1) each Lender's obligation to make Revolving
         Loans for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans
         pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and each Lender's obligation
         to purchase a participation in any unpaid Swing Line Loans pursuant to
         the immediately preceding paragraph shall be absolute and unconditional
         and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including without
         limitation (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
         right which such Lender may have against Swing Line Lender, any Credit
         Party or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence
         or continuation of a Default or Event of Default; (C) any adverse
         change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition
         (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any Credit Party; (D) any
         breach of this Agreement or any other Credit Document by any party
         thereto; or (E) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that such
         obligations of each Lender are subject to the condition that Swing Line
         Lender believed in good faith that all conditions under Section 3.2 to
         the making of the applicable Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid
         Swing Line Loans, were satisfied at the time such Refunded Swing Line
         Loans or unpaid Swing Line Loans were made, or the satisfaction of any
         such condition not satisfied had been waived by Requisite Lenders prior
         to or at the time such Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing
         Line Loans were made; and (2) Swing Line Lender shall not be obligated
         to make any Swing Line Loans (A) if it has elected not to do so after
         the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or Event of
         Default or (B) at a time when a Funding Default exists unless Swing
         Line Lender has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it and
         Company to eliminate Swing Line Lender's risk with respect to the
         Defaulting Lender's participation in such Swing Ling Loan, including by
         cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
         outstanding Swing Line Loans.

                  2.4      ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PURCHASE OF
PARTICIPATIONS THEREIN.

                           (a)      Letters of Credit. During the Revolving

agrees to issue Letters of Credit for the account of Company in the aggregate
amount up to but not exceeding the

Letter of Credit Sublimit at any time outstanding; provided, (i) each Letter of
Credit shall be denominated in Dollars; (ii) the stated amount of each Letter of
Credit shall not be less than $50,000 or such lesser amount as is acceptable to
Issuing Bank; (iii) after giving effect to such issuance, in no event shall the
Total Utilization of Revolving Commitments exceed the aggregate amount of all
Revolving Commitments then in effect; (iv) after giving effect to such issuance,
in no event shall the Letter of Credit Usage exceed the Letter of Credit
Sublimit then in effect; and (v) in no event shall any Letter of Credit have an
expiration date later than the earlier of (1) the Revolving Commitment
Termination Date and (2) the date which is one year from the date of issuance of
such Letter of Credit. Subject to the foregoing, Issuing Bank may agree that a
Letter of Credit will automatically be extended for one or more successive
periods not to exceed one year each, unless Issuing Bank elects not to extend
for any such additional period; provided, Issuing Bank shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Requisite Lenders, extend any such Letter of Credit
if it has received written notice that an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing at the time Issuing Bank must elect to allow such extension;
provided, further, in the event a Funding Default exists, Issuing Bank shall not
be required to issue any Letter of Credit unless Issuing Bank has entered into
arrangements satisfactory to it and Company to eliminate Issuing Bank's risk
with respect to the participation in Letters of Credit of the Defaulting Lender,
including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Letter of Credit Usage.

                           (b)      Notice of Issuance. Whenever Company desires
the issuance of a Letter of Credit, it shall deliver to Administrative Agent an
Issuance Notice no later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least five (5)
Business Days or such shorter period as may be agreed to by Issuing Bank in any
particular instance, in advance of the proposed date of issuance. Upon
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 3.2, Issuing Bank
shall issue the requested Letter of Credit only in accordance with Issuing
Bank's standard operating procedures. Upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit
or amendment or modification to a Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify each Lender of such issuance, which notice shall include the amount of
such Lender's respective participation in such Letter of Credit pursuant to
Section 2.4(e).

                           (c)      Responsibility of Issuing Bank With Respect
to Requests for Drawings and Payments. In determining whether to honor any
drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, Issuing Bank
shall be responsible only to examine the documents delivered under such Letter
of Credit with reasonable care so as to ascertain whether they appear on their
face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.
As between Company and Issuing Bank, Company assumes all risks of the acts and
omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by Issuing Bank, by the
respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for: (i) the
form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and
issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in
any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;
(ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
be

                                       47

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT

<PAGE>

invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any
such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions required in order to
draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays
in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or
otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of
technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or
of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such
Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or
(viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of Issuing Bank,
including any Governmental Acts; none of the above shall affect or impair, or
prevent the vesting of, any of Issuing Bank's rights or powers hereunder.
Without limiting the foregoing and in furtherance thereof, any action taken or
omitted by Issuing Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit or any
documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good
faith, (and without gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance
with the standard of care specified in the UCC with respect to Letter of
Credit), shall not give rise to any liability on the part of Issuing Bank to
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
2.4(c), Company shall retain any and all rights it may have against Issuing Bank
for any liability arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Issuing Bank.

                           (d)      Reimbursement by Company of Amounts Drawn or
Paid Under Letters of Credit. In the event Issuing Bank has determined to honor
a drawing under a Letter of Credit, it shall immediately notify Company and
Administrative Agent, and Company shall reimburse Issuing Bank on the Business
Day such drawing is honored (the "REIMBURSEMENT DATE") in an amount in Dollars
and in same day funds equal to the amount of such honored drawing; provided,
anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless Company
shall have notified Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank prior to 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) on the date such drawing is honored that Company intends to
reimburse Issuing Bank for the amount of such honored drawing with funds other
than the proceeds of Revolving Loans, Company shall be deemed to have given a
timely Funding Notice to Administrative Agent requesting Lenders to make
Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount
in Dollars equal to the amount of such honored drawing, and (ii) subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in Section 3.2, Lenders
shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans
in the amount of such honored drawing, the proceeds of which shall be applied
directly by Administrative Agent to reimburse Issuing Bank for the amount of
such honored drawing; and provided further, if for any reason proceeds of
Revolving Loans are not received by Issuing Bank on the Reimbursement Date in an
amount equal to the amount of such honored drawing, Company shall reimburse
Issuing Bank, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal to the excess of
the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate amount of such Revolving
Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this Section 2.4(d) shall be
deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on the
terms and conditions set forth herein, and Company shall retain any and all
rights it may have against any Lender resulting from the failure of such Lender
to make such Revolving Loans under this Section 2.4(d).

                           (e)      Lenders' Purchase of Participations in
Letters of Credit. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Lender having a Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to have purchased, and
hereby agrees to irrevocably purchase, from Issuing Bank a participation in such
Letter of Credit and any drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to such
Lender's Pro Rata Share (with respect to the Revolving Commitments) of the
maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn
thereunder. In the event that Company shall fail for any reason to reimburse
Issuing Bank as provided in Section 2.4(d), Issuing Bank shall promptly notify
each Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such honored drawing and of such
Lender's respective participation therein based on such Lender's Pro Rata Share
of the Revolving Commitments. Each Lender shall make available to Issuing Bank
an amount equal to its respective participation, in Dollars and in same day
funds, at the office of Issuing Bank specified in such notice (provided Issuing
Bank shall have given such notice by 10:00 a.m. (New York City time)), not later
than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date notified by Issuing Bank. In the
event that any Lender fails to make available to Issuing Bank on such business
day the amount of such Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit as
provided in this Section 2.4(e), Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover such
amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon for three
Business Days at the rate customarily used by Issuing Bank for the correction of
errors among banks and thereafter at the Base Rate. Nothing in this Section
2.4(e) shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Lender to recover from
Issuing Bank any amounts made available by such Lender to Issuing Bank pursuant
to this Section in the event that it is determined that the payment with respect
to a Letter of Credit in respect of which payment was made by such Lender
constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of Issuing Bank.
In the event Issuing Bank shall have been reimbursed by other Lenders pursuant
to this Section 2.4(e) for all or any portion of any drawing honored by Issuing
Bank under a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank shall distribute to each Lender
which has paid all amounts payable by it under this Section 2.4(e) with respect
to such honored drawing such Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments
subsequently received by Issuing Bank from Company in reimbursement of such
honored drawing when such payments are received. Any such distribution shall be
made to a Lender at its primary address set forth below its name on Appendix A
or at such other address as such Lender may request.

                           (f)      Obligations Absolute. The obligation of
Company to reimburse Issuing Bank for drawings honored under the Letters of
Credit issued by it and to repay any Revolving Loans made by Lenders pursuant to
Section 2.4(d) and the obligations of Lenders under Section 2.4(e) shall be
unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms hereof under all circumstances including any of the following
circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit; (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which
Company or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary or any
transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such transferee
may be acting), Issuing Bank, Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a
Lender, against Company, whether in connection herewith, the transactions
contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying
transaction between Company or one of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for
which any Letter of Credit was procured); (iii) any

draft or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (iv) payment by Issuing Bank
under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document
which does not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (v)
any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects of Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(vi) any breach hereof or any other Credit Document by any party thereto; (vii)
any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing; or (viii) the fact that an Event of Default or a Default shall
have occurred and be continuing; provided, in each case, that payment by Issuing
Bank under the applicable Letter of Credit shall not have constituted gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Bank or failure to use the
standard of care specified in the UCC with respect to such Letters of Credit
Issuing Bank under the circumstances in question.

                           (g)      Indemnification. Without duplication of any
obligation of Company under Section 10.2 or 10.3, in addition to amounts payable
as provided herein, Company hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save
harmless Issuing Bank from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable and
documented fees and out-of-pocket disbursements of counsel) which Issuing Bank
may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the
issuance of any Letter of Credit by Issuing Bank, other than as a result of (1)
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Bank or (2) the wrongful
dishonor by Issuing Bank of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of
Credit issued by it, or (ii) the failure of Issuing Bank to honor a drawing
under any such Letter of Credit as a result of any Governmental Act.

                  2.5      PRO RATA SHARES; AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.

                           (a)      Pro Rata Shares. All Loans shall be made,
and all participations purchased, by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately
to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that no Lender shall be
responsible for any default by any other Lender in such other Lender's
obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder or purchase a participation
required hereby nor shall any Term Loan Commitment or any Revolving Commitment
of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of a default by any other
Lender in such other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder or
purchase a participation required hereby.

                           (b)      Availability of Funds. Unless Administrative
Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to 10 a.m. (New York City
time) on the applicable Credit Date that such Lender does not intend to make
available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's Loan requested on
such Credit Date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
amount available to Administrative Agent on such Credit Date and Administrative
Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to, make available
to Company a corresponding amount on such Credit Date. If such corresponding
amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by such Lender,
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to

                                       50

recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with
interest thereon, for each day from such Credit Date until the date such amount
is paid to Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative
Agent for the correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and
thereafter at the Base Rate. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding
amount forthwith upon Administrative Agent's demand therefor, Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify Company and Company shall immediately pay such
corresponding amount to Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for
each day from such Credit Date until the date such amount is paid to
Administrative Agent, at the rate payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans for such
Class of Loans. Nothing in this Section 2.5(b) shall be deemed to relieve any
Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Term Loan Commitments and Revolving
Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Company may have against
any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

                  2.6      USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Tranche B Term
Loan made on the Closing Date shall be applied by Company together with the
proceeds of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued on the Closing Date to
refinance Company's existing indebtedness and to pay transaction fees and other
expenses. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans made, and
Letters of Credit issued, on or after the Closing Date shall be applied by
Company for general corporate purposes of Company and its Subsidiaries,
including working capital and Permitted Acquisitions; provided that no more than
$25,000,000 of borrowings under the Revolving Facility may be used to finance
Permitted Acquisitions. The proceeds of the New Term Loans made on the Increased
Amount Date shall be applied by Company to refinance the Omega Loan in full and
to pay transaction fees and expenses. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Letters of Credit may, among other things, be issued for purposes of
replacing or backing any letters of credit previously issued under the Existing
Facilities. No portion of the proceeds of any Credit Extension shall be used in
any manner that causes or might cause such Credit Extension or the application
of such proceeds to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation thereof
or to violate the Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that a portion of the proceeds of the
Term Loan is being used, directly or indirectly, to refinance debt which in turn
refinanced prepetition Indebtedness of the Company relating to the Health Care
Facility known as Superior Woods in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and to the Health Care
Facilities operated by the PHCMI Group Members.

                  2.7      EVIDENCE OF DEBT; REGISTER; LENDERS' BOOKS AND
RECORDS; NOTES.

                           (a)      Lenders' Evidence of Debt. Each Lender shall
maintain on its internal records an account or accounts evidencing the
Indebtedness of Company to such Lender, including the amounts of the Loans made
by it and each repayment and prepayment in respect thereof. Any such recordation
shall be conclusive and binding on Company, absent manifest error; provided,
failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall
not affect any Lender's Revolving Commitments or Company's Obligations in
respect of any applicable Loans; and provided further, in the

                                       51

event of any inconsistency between the Register and any Lender's records, absent
manifest error the recordations in the Register shall govern.

                           (b)      Register. Administrative Agent shall
maintain at its Principal Office a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of Lenders and the Revolving Commitments and Loans of each Lender from
time to time (the "REGISTER"). The Register shall be available for inspection by
Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the
Revolving Commitments and the Loans, and each repayment or prepayment in respect
of the principal amount of the Loans, and any such recordation shall be
conclusive and binding on Company and each Lender, absent manifest error;
provided, failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such
recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Revolving Commitments or Company's
Obligations in respect of any Loan. Company hereby designates Administrative
Agent to serve as Company's agent solely for purposes of maintaining the
Register as provided in this Section 2.7, and Company hereby agrees that, to the
extent Administrative Agent serves in such capacity, Administrative Agent and
its officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates shall constitute
"INDEMNITEES."

                           (c)      Notes. If so requested by any Lender by
written notice to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, or at any time thereafter, Company
shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and/or, if applicable and if so
specified in such notice, to any Person who is an assignee of such Lender
pursuant to Section 10.6) on the Closing Date (or, if such notice is delivered
after the Closing Date, promptly after Company's receipt of such notice) a Note
or New Term Loan or Notes to evidence such Lender's Tranche B Term Loan,
Revolving Loan, Swing Line Loan or New Term Loan, as the case may be.

                  2.8      INTEREST ON LOANS.

                           (a)      Except as otherwise set forth herein, each
Class of Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from
the date made through repayment (whether by acceleration or otherwise) thereof
as follows:

                                    (i)      in the case of Revolving Loans:

                                             (1)      if a Base Rate Loan, at
         the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; or

                                             (2)       if a Eurodollar Rate
         Loan, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin;

                                    (ii)     in the case of Swing Line Loans, at
         the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; and

                                    (iii)    in the case of Tranche B Term
         Loans:

                                       52

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT

<PAGE>

                                             (1)       if a Base Rate Loan, at
         the Base Rate plus 1.75% per annum; or

                                             (2)       if a Eurodollar Rate
         Loan, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 2.75% per annum.

                           provided that each of the above rates in this Section
2.8(a)(iii) in respect of Tranche B Term Loans shall decrease by 0.25% per annum
if the Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio is less than 4.25:1.00, such change
to be effective on the earliest to occur of March 1, June 1, September 1,
December 1 after the date on which the Administrative Agent shall have received
the applicable Compliance Certificate or Pricing Certificate pursuant to Section
5.1(c) calculating such Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio.

                           (b)      The basis for determining the rate of
interest with respect to any Loan (except a Swing Line Loan which can be made
and maintained as Base Rate Loans only), and the Interest Period with respect to
any Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be selected by Company and notified to
Administrative Agent and Lenders pursuant to the applicable Funding Notice or
Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be, provided that the Term Loans
initially shall be made as Base Rate Loans, and until a date which is at least
five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date or such earlier date as
Administrative Agent may determine in its sole discretion, the Term Loans shall
be maintained as Base Rate Loans, and unless the Administrative Agent otherwise
consents in its sole discretion, no such initial Base Rate Loan shall be
converted into a Eurodollar Rate Loan having an Interest Period of longer than
one month. If on any day a Loan is outstanding with respect to which a Funding
Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice has not been delivered to
Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof specifying the
applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day such
Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan.

                           (c)      In connection with Eurodollar Rate Loans
there shall be no more than ten (10) Interest Periods outstanding at any time.
In the event Company fails to specify between a Base Rate Loan or a Eurodollar
Rate Loan in the applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice,
such Loan (if outstanding as a Eurodollar Rate Loan) will be automatically
converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then-current Interest
Period for such Loan (or if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan will remain as, or
(if not then outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan). In the event
Company fails to specify an Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan in the
applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, Company shall be
deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month. As soon as practicable
after 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date,
Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest
error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that
shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then
being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give
notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and
each Lender.

                           (d)      Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.8(a)
shall be computed (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans on the basis of a 365-day
or 366-day year, as the case may be, and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate
Loans, on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of
days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on any
Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period
applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted
from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan
to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of
payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to
such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a Eurodollar
Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such Eurodollar Rate
Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded; provided, if a Loan is repaid on
the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on that Loan.

                           (e)      Except as otherwise set forth herein,
interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on and to (i) each Interest
Payment Date applicable to that Loan; (ii) any prepayment of that Loan, whether
voluntary or mandatory, to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid; and
(iii) at maturity, including final maturity; provided, however, with respect to
any voluntary prepayment of a Base Rate Loan, accrued interest shall instead be
payable on the applicable Interest Payment Date.

                           (f)      Company agrees to pay to Issuing Bank, with
respect to drawings honored under any Letter of Credit, interest on the amount
paid by Issuing Bank in respect of each such honored drawing from the date such
drawing is honored to but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by or on
behalf of Company at a rate equal to (i) for the period from the date such
drawing is honored to but excluding the applicable Reimbursement Date, the rate
of interest otherwise payable hereunder with respect to Revolving Loans that are
Base Rate Loans, and (ii) thereafter, a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of
the rate of interest otherwise payable hereunder with respect to Revolving Loans
that are Base Rate Loans.

                           (g)      Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.8(f)
shall be computed on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of
days elapsed in the period during which it accrues, and shall be payable on
demand or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related drawing under
a Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full. Promptly upon receipt by Issuing Bank
of any payment of interest pursuant to Section 2.8(f), Issuing Bank shall
distribute to each Lender, out of the interest received by Issuing Bank in
respect of the period from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the
date on which Issuing Bank is reimbursed for the amount of such drawing
(including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans),
the amount that such Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of
the letter of credit fee that would have been payable in respect of such Letter
of Credit for such period if no drawing had been honored under such Letter of
Credit. In the event Issuing Bank shall have been reimbursed by Lenders for all
or any portion of such honored drawing, Issuing Bank shall distribute to each
Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under Section 2.4(e) with
respect to such honored drawing such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any interest
received by Issuing Bank in respect of that portion of such honored drawing so

                                       54

reimbursed by Lenders for the period from the date on which Issuing Bank was so
reimbursed by Lenders to but excluding the date on which such portion of such
honored drawing is reimbursed by Company.

                  2.9      CONVERSION/CONTINUATION.

                           (a)      Subject to Section 2.18 and so long as no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and then be continuing, Company
shall have the option:

                                    (i)      to convert at any time all or any
         part of any Term Loan or Revolving Loan equal to $5,000,000 and
         integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount from one Type
         of Loan to another Type of Loan; provided, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may
         only be converted on the expiration of the Interest Period applicable
         to such Eurodollar Rate Loan unless Company shall pay all amounts due
         under Section 2.18 in connection with any such conversion; or

                                    (ii)     upon the expiration of any Interest
         Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or any
         portion of such Loan equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of
         $100,000 in excess of that amount as a Eurodollar Rate Loan.

                           (b)      Company shall deliver a
Conversion/Continuation Notice to Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) at least one (1) Business Day in advance of the proposed
conversion date (in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least
three (3) Business Days in advance of the proposed conversion/continuation date
(in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan).
Except as otherwise provided herein, a Conversion/Continuation Notice for
conversion to, or continuation of, any Eurodollar Rate Loans (or telephonic
notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest
Rate Determination Date, and Company shall be bound to effect a conversion or
continuation in accordance therewith.

                  2.10     DEFAULT INTEREST. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of (i) an Event of Default under Section 8.1(a), the principal
amount of all Loans and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest
payments on the Loans and any fees or other amounts owed hereunder not paid when
due, shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in any
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws)
payable on demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate
otherwise payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans and (ii) at any time following
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (other than an
Event of Default under Section 8.1(a)) Administrative Agent may, and at the
direction of Requisite Lenders shall, declare that the principal amount of all
Loans shall bear interest (retroactively from the occurrence of such Event of
Default and including post petition interest in any proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand at a rate
that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder
for Base Rate Loans; provided, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, upon the
expiration of the Interest Period in effect at the time any

                                       55

such increase in interest rate is effective such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
thereupon become Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear interest payable upon
demand at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise
payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans. Payment or acceptance of the increased
rates of interest provided for in this Section 2.10 is not a permitted
alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of
Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative
Agent or any Lender.

                  2.11     FEES.

                           (a)      Company agrees to pay to Lenders having
Revolving Exposure:

         the Lender during the preceding calendar quarter multiplied by (2) the
         Applicable Revolving Commitment Fee Percentage; and

                                    (ii)     Letter of Credit fees for the

         of Credit (regardless of whether any conditions for drawing could then

         determination).

All fees referred to in this Section 2.11(a) shall be paid to Administrative
Agent at its Principal Office and upon receipt, Administrative Agent shall
promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof.

                           (b)      Company agrees to pay directly to Issuing
Bank, for its own account, the following fees:

                                    (i)      a fronting fee to be separately

         0.250% per annum), times the average aggregate daily maximum amount
         available to be drawn (and then undrawn) under all Letters of Credit

         such charges and as in effect at the time of such issuance, amendment,
         transfer or payment, as the case may be.

to such excess, and Company shall concurrently therewith deliver to
Administrative Agent a certificate of an Authorized Officer demonstrating the
derivation of such excess.

                  2.15     APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS/REDUCTIONS.

                           (a)      Application of Voluntary Prepayments by Type
of Loans. Any prepayment of any Loan pursuant to Section 2.13(a) shall be
applied as specified by Company in the applicable notice of prepayment;
provided, in the event Company fails to specify the Loans to which any such

                  extent thereof;

                  SECOND, to repay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full
                  extent thereof; and

                  THIRD, to prepay the Term Loans to the full extent thereof.

                  Any prepayment of any Term Loan pursuant to Section 2.13(a)
shall be further applied to reduce the scheduled remaining Installments of
principal on such Term Loan in inverse order of maturity.

                           (b)      Application of Mandatory Prepayments by Type
of Loans.

                                    (i)      Any amount required to be paid
         pursuant to Sections 2.14(a) through 2.14(e) shall be applied as
         follows:

                  FIRST, to prepay Term Loans on a pro rata basis applied on a
                  pro rata basis and reduce the remaining scheduled Installments
                  in inverse order of maturity;

                  SECOND, to prepay the Swing Line Loans to the full extent
                  thereof and to permanently reduce the Revolving Commitments by
                  the amount of such prepayment;

                  THIRD, to prepay the Revolving Loans to the full extent
                  thereof and so long as an Event of Default exists and is
                  continuing, to further permanently reduce the Revolving
                  Commitments by the amount of such prepayment;

                                       62

                  FOURTH, to prepay outstanding reimbursement obligations with
                  respect to Letters of Credit and so long as an Event of
                  Default exists and is continuing, to further permanently
                  reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments by the amount of such
                  prepayment;

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as an Event of Default
exists and is continuing, any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section
2.14(a) through Section 2.14(e) shall be applied to prepay the Term Loans and
outstanding Revolving Loans on a pro rata basis and, in respect of the Term
Loans, any such amounts shall be applied on a pro rata basis and reduce the
remaining scheduled Installments of principal on each such Term Loan in inverse
order of maturity.

                                    (ii)     Any amount required to be paid
         pursuant to Section 2.14 (f) shall be applied, first, to the prepayment
         of Revolving Loans (without reduction of the Revolving Commitments)
         outstanding on such date, and, second, to the prepayment of Term Loans
         or otherwise as provided in Section 2.14(f). Each such prepayment of
         the Term Loans shall be applied to reduce scheduled Installments in
         inverse order of maturity and may not be reborrowed.

                                    (iii)    If a Default or an Event of Default
         has occurred and is then continuing, at any time a prepayment is
         required under Section 2.15(b)(i) or 2.15(b)(ii), then such prepayment
         shall be applied to the outstanding principal balance (in inverse order
         of maturity in the case of Term Loans) of Term Loans and Revolving
         Loans ratably to each Class of Loans in accordance with each Lender's
         proportionate share of each Class of such Loans.

                                    (iv)     All prepayments of Loans under this
         Section 2.15(b) shall, as regards a Type of Loan, be applied first to
         Base Rate Loans, and subject to Section 2.15(b)(v) hereof, then to
         Eurodollar Loans in the order of the scheduled expiry of Interest
         Periods with respect thereto (i.e. those Eurodollar Loans with Interest
         Periods which end sooner would be paid before those with Interest
         Periods which end later).

                                    (v)      If on any day on which Loans would
         otherwise be required to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.15,
         (each a "PREPAYMENT DATE"), the amount of such required prepayment
         exceeds the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Base Rate
         Loans which are of the Class required to be prepaid, and no Default or
         Event of Default exists or is continuing, then on such Prepayment Date,
         then, at any time following the establishment of the Cash Collateral
         Account pursuant to Section 9.9, at the election of Company, (i)
         Company shall deposit Dollars into the Cash Collateral Account in an
         amount equal to such excess, and only the outstanding Base Rate Loans
         which are of the Class required to be prepaid shall be required to be
         prepaid on such Prepayment Date and (ii) on the last day of each
         Interest Period after such Prepayment Date in effect with respect to a
         Eurodollar Loan which is of the Class required to be prepaid,
         Administrative Agent is irrevocably authorized and directed to apply
         funds from the Cash Collateral Account (and liquidate investments held

interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made in Dollars in same day funds,
without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any restriction or condition,
and delivered to Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on the date due at Administrative Agent's Principal Office for the account
of Lenders; funds received by Administrative Agent after that time on such due
date shall be deemed to have been paid by Company on the next succeeding
Business Day.

                           (b)      All payments in respect of the principal
amount of any Loan (other than voluntary prepayments of Revolving Loans) shall
include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or
prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of
any Loan on a date when interest is due and payable with respect to such Loan)
shall be applied to the payment of interest before application to principal.

                           (c)      Administrative Agent shall promptly
distribute to each Lender at such address as such Lender shall indicate in
writing, such Lender's applicable Pro Rata Share of all payments and prepayments
of principal and interest due hereunder, together with all other amounts due
thereto, including, without limitation, all fees payable with respect thereto,
to the extent received by Administrative Agent.

                           (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
hereof, if any Conversion/Continuation Notice is withdrawn as to any Affected
Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata
Share of any Eurodollar Rate Loans, Administrative Agent shall give effect
thereto in apportioning payments received thereafter.

                           (e)      Subject to the provisos set forth in the
definition of "INTEREST PERIOD," whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall
be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
included in the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the
Revolving Commitment fees hereunder.

                           (f)      Company hereby authorizes Administrative
Agent to charge any of Company's accounts with Administrative Agent in order to
cause timely payment to be made to Administrative Agent of all principal,
interest, fees and expenses and other Obligations due and payable hereunder
(subject to sufficient funds being available in its accounts for that purpose),
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Company of each occasion on which
Administrative Agent so charges any of Company's accounts, including the amount
of such charge and how such amounts were applied to the Obligations.

                           (g)      Administrative Agent shall deem any payment
by or on behalf of Company hereunder that is not made in same day funds prior to
12:00 p.m. (New York City time) to be a non-conforming payment. Any such payment
shall not be deemed to have been received by Administrative Agent until the
later of (i) the time such funds become available funds, and (ii) the applicable
next Business Day. Administrative Agent shall give prompt telephonic notice to
Company and each applicable Lender (confirmed in writing) if any payment is
non-conforming. Any non-conforming payment may constitute or become a Default or
Event of Default in accordance with the terms of Section 8.1(a). Interest shall
continue to accrue on any principal as to which a non-conforming payment is made
until such funds become available funds (but in no event less than the period
from the date of such payment to the next succeeding applicable Business Day) at
the rate determined pursuant to Section 2.10 from the date such amount was due
and payable until the date such amount is paid in full.

                           (h)      If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and not otherwise been waived, and the maturity of the Obligations shall have
been accelerated pursuant to Section 8.1, all payments or proceeds received by
Agents hereunder in respect of any of the Obligations, shall be applied in
accordance with the application arrangements described in Section 9.10.

                  2.17     RATABLE SHARING. Lenders hereby agree among
themselves that, except as may otherwise be provided in the Collateral Documents
with respect to amounts realized from the exercise of rights with respect to
Liens on the Collateral, if any of them shall, whether by voluntary payment
(other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made and applied in accordance with
the terms hereof), through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's
lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under
the Credit Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit
treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or
reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest,
amounts payable in respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due
and owing to such Lender hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
(collectively, the "AGGREGATE AMOUNTS DUE" to such Lender) which is greater than
the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts
Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater
payment shall (a) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the
receipt of such payment and (b) apply a portion of such payment to purchase
participations (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a
participation simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of
such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such
recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion
to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them; provided, if all or part of such
proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Company or
otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for
such participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest. Company expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased
may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with
respect to any and all monies

were owed the amount of the participation held by that holder.

                  2.18     MAKING OR MAINTAINING EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.

                           (a)      Inability to Determine Applicable Interest
Rate. In the event that Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar
Rate Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank
market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate
applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate, Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by
telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and each Lender
of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted to,
Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as Administrative Agent notifies Company
and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist,
and (ii) any Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by Company
with respect to the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall
be deemed to be rescinded by Company.

                           (b)      Illegality or Impracticability of Eurodollar
Rate Loans. In the event that on any date any Lender shall have determined
(which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto but shall be made only after consultation with Company and Administrative
Agent) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans
(I) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith
with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or
would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or
order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith
would not be unlawful), or (ii) has become impracticable, as a result of
contingencies occurring after the date hereof which materially and adversely
affect the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in that
market, then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an "AFFECTED LENDER"
and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed
in writing) to Company and Administrative Agent of such determination (which
notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender).
Thereafter (1) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to
convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such notice
shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (2) to the extent such determination
by the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by
Company pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the
Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or continue such Loan as or convert
such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan, (3) the Affected Lender's
obligation to maintain its outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans (the "AFFECTED
LOANS") shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the
Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when
required by law, and (4) the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into
Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates
to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Company

pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, Company shall
have the option, subject to the provisions of Section 2.18(c), to rescind such
Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice as to all Lenders by giving
notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Administrative
Agent of such rescission on the date on which the Affected Lender gives notice
of its determination as described above (which notice of rescission
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Section 2.18(b)
shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to make
or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans in
accordance with the terms hereof.

                           (c)      Compensation for Breakage or
Non-Commencement of Interest Periods. Company shall compensate each Lender, upon
written request by such Lender (which request shall set forth the basis for
requesting such amounts), for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including
any interest paid by such Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or
carry its Eurodollar Rate Loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by
such Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds
but excluding loss of anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if
for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a borrowing of any
Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Funding
Notice or a telephonic request for borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation
of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a
Conversion/Continuation Notice or a telephonic request for conversion or
continuation; (ii) if any prepayment or other principal payment or any
conversion of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans occurs on a date prior to the
last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan; or (iii) if any
prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on any date specified
in a notice of prepayment given by Company.

                           (d)      Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any Lender
may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to, or for the account of
any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of such Lender.

                           (e)      Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar
Rate Loans. Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section
2.18 and under Section 2.19 shall be made as though such Lender had actually
funded each of its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a
Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to clause (I)
of the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount
of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to the relevant
Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an
offshore office of such Lender to a domestic office of such Lender in the United
States of America; provided, however, each Lender may fund each of its
Eurodollar Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions
shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating amounts payable under
this Section 2.18 and under Section 2.19.

                           (a)      Compensation For Increased Costs and Taxes.
Subject to the provisions of Section 2.20 (which shall be controlling with
respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any Lender (which
term shall include Issuing Bank for purposes of this Section 2.19(a)) shall
determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty or
governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change therein or in the
interpretation, administration or application thereof (including the
introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order),
or any determination of a court or governmental authority, in each case that
becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender with any
guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date hereof by any
central bank or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority (whether or
not having the force of law): (I) subjects such Lender (or its applicable
lending office) to any additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net
income of such Lender) with respect to this Agreement or any of the other Credit
Documents or any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or any payments to
such Lender (or its applicable lending office) of principal, interest, fees or
any other amount payable hereunder; (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable
any reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other
reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for
the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any
other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any such
reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans that are
reflected in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or (iii) imposes any
other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or affecting such
Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations hereunder or the
London interbank market; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase
the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make, making or maintaining Loans
hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or its
applicable lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, Company
shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in
the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the form of an
increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise
as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) to the extent such
increased costs of capital are due to changes in applicable law or regulatory
policy first occurring after the execution of the Commitment Letter, as may be
necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in
amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver to Company
(with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to such
Lender under this Section 2.19(a), which statement shall be conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

                           (b)      Capital Adequacy Adjustment. In the event
that any Lender (which term shall include Issuing Bank for purposes of this
Section 2.19(b)) shall have determined that the adoption, effectiveness,
phase-in or applicability after the Closing Date of any law, rule or regulation
(or any provision thereof) regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any

Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its
applicable lending office) with any guideline, request or directive issued or
made after the date hereof regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the
force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a
consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender's Loans or Revolving
Commitments or Letters of Credit, or participations therein or other obligations
hereunder with respect to the Loans or the Letters of Credit to a level below
that which such Lender or such controlling corporation could have achieved but
for such adoption, effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or compliance
(taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling
corporation with regard to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within
five (5) Business Days after receipt by Company from such Lender of the
statement referred to in the next sentence, Company shall pay to such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
controlling corporation on an after-tax basis for such reduction. Such Lender
shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written
statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the
additional amounts owed to Lender under this Section 2.19(b), which statement
shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

                  2.20     TAXES; WITHHOLDING, ETC.

                           (a)      Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums
payable by any Credit Party hereunder and under the other Credit Documents shall
(except to the extent required by law) be paid free and clear of, and without
any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax (other than a Tax on the
overall net income of any Lender or a franchise Tax) imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by or within the United States of America or any political
subdivision in or of the United States of America or any other jurisdiction from
or to which a payment is made by or on behalf of any Credit Party or by any
federation or organization of which the United States of America or any such
jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment.

                           (b)      Withholding of Taxes. If any Credit Party or
any other Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on
account of any such Tax from any sum paid or payable by any Credit Party to
Administrative Agent or any Lender (which term shall include Issuing Bank for
purposes of this Section 2.20(b)) under any of the Credit Documents: (i) Company
shall notify Administrative Agent of any such requirement or any change in any
such requirement as soon as Company becomes aware of it; (ii) Company shall pay
any such Tax before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to
be made (if the liability to pay is imposed on any Credit Party) for its own
account or (if that liability is imposed on Administrative Agent or such Lender,
as the case may be) on behalf of and in the name of Administrative Agent or such
Lender; (iii) the sum payable by such Credit Party in respect of which the
relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be increased to the
extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding
or payment, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on
the due date a net

sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction, withholding or
payment been required or made; and (iv) within thirty (30) days after paying any
sum from which it is required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and
within thirty (30) days after the due date of payment of any Tax which it is
required by clause (ii) above to pay, Company shall deliver to Administrative
Agent evidence satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction,
withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or
other authority; provided, no such additional amount shall be required to be
paid to any Lender under clause (iii) above except to the extent that any change
after the date hereof (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages
hereof on the Closing Date) or after the effective date of the Assignment
Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each
other Lender) in any such requirement for a deduction, withholding or payment as
is mentioned therein shall result in an increase in the rate of such deduction,
withholding or payment from that in effect at the date hereof or at the date of
such Assignment Agreement, as the case may be, in respect of payments to such
Lender.

                           (c)      Evidence of Exemption From U.S. Withholding
Tax. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (as such term is defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (a "NON-US LENDER") shall deliver to Administrative Agent for
transmission to Company, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each
Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or on or prior
to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender
(in the case of each other Lender), and at such other times as may be necessary
in the determination of Company or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable
exercise of its discretion), (I) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor forms), properly completed and duly
executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the
Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by Company to establish that such
Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of principal, interest,
fees or other amounts payable under any of the Credit Documents, or (ii) if such
Lender is not a "bank" or other Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN or W-8ECI pursuant to clause (I) above, a Certificate re Non-Bank Status
together with two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or any
successor form), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such
other documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably
requested by Company to establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction
or withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments
to such Lender of interest payable under any of the Credit Documents. Each
Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with
respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters pursuant to this
Section 2.20(c) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial delivery by
such Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in
time or change in circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other
evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Lender shall
promptly deliver to Administrative Agent for transmission to Company two new
original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or a
Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue

such Lender, and such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue
Code and reasonably requested by Company to confirm or establish that such
Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax with respect to payments to such Lender under the Credit Documents,
or notify Administrative Agent and Company of its inability to deliver any such
forms, certificates or other evidence. Company shall not be required to pay any
additional amount to any Non-US Lender under Section 2.20(b)(iii) if such Lender
shall have failed (1) to deliver the forms, certificates or other evidence
referred to in the second sentence of this Section 2.20(c), or (2) to notify
Administrative Agent and Company of its inability to deliver any such forms,
certificates or other evidence, as the case may be; provided, if such Lender
shall have satisfied the requirements of the first sentence of this Section
2.20(c) on the Closing Date or on the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant
to which it became a Lender, as applicable, nothing in this last sentence of
Section 2.20(c) shall relieve Company of its obligation to pay any additional
amounts pursuant to Section 2.19(a) in the event that, as a result of any change
in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any
change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender
is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence
at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject to
withholding as described herein.

                  2.21     OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE. Each Lender (which term shall
include Issuing Bank for purposes of this Section 2.21) agrees that, as promptly
as practicable after the officer of such Lender responsible for administering
its Loans or Letters of Credit, as the case may be, becomes aware of the
occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would cause such
Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender to receive
payments under Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20, it will, to the extent not
inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender and any applicable legal
or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts to (a) make, issue, fund or
maintain its Credit Extensions, including any Affected Loans, through another
office of such Lender, or (b) take such other measures as such Lender may deem
reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such
Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts
which would otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender pursuant to Section
2.19, or 2.20 would be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender
in its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such
Revolving Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit through such other office or
in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise
adversely affect such Revolving Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit or the
interests of such Lender; provided, such Lender will not be obligated to utilize
such other office pursuant to this Section 2.21 unless Company agrees to pay all
incremental expenses incurred by such Lender as a result of utilizing such other
office as described in clause (I) above. A certificate as to the amount of any
such expenses payable by Company pursuant to this Section 2.21 (setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender
to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

                  2.22     DEFAULTING LENDERS. Anything contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any Lender defaults (a "DEFAULTING
LENDER") in its obligation to fund (a "FUNDING DEFAULT") any Revolving Loan or
its portion of any unreimbursed payment under Section 2.3(b)(iv) or 2.4(e) (in
each case, a "DEFAULTED LOAN"), then (a) during any Default Period with respect
to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a
"LENDER" for purposes of voting on any matters (including the granting of any
consents or waivers) with respect to any of the Credit Documents; (b) to the
extent permitted by applicable law, until such time as the Default Excess with
respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero, (I) any
voluntary prepayment of the Revolving Loans shall, if Company so directs at the
time of making such voluntary prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of
other Lenders as if such Defaulting Lender had no Revolving Loans outstanding
and the Revolving Exposure of such Defaulting Lender were zero, and (ii) any
mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans shall, if Company so directs at the
time of making such mandatory prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of
other Lenders (but not to the Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender) as if
such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Loans of such Defaulting Lender,
it being understood and agreed that Company shall be entitled to retain any
portion of any mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans that is not paid to
such Defaulting Lender solely as a result of the operation of the provisions of
this clause (b); (c) such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment and
outstanding Revolving Loans and such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Letter of Credit Usage shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the
Revolving Commitment fee payable to Lenders in respect of any day during any
Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and such Defaulting
Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Revolving Commitment fee pursuant to
Section 2.11 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment in
respect of any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender; and (d)
the Total Utilization of Revolving Commitments as at any date of determination
shall be calculated as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Loans
of such Defaulting Lender. No Revolving Commitment of any Lender shall be

Subsidiaries is engaged in any unfair labor practice that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is (a) no unfair labor
practice complaint pending against Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or to the
best knowledge of Company, threatened against any of them before the National
Labor Relations Board and no grievance or arbitration proceeding arising out of
or under any collective bargaining agreement that is so pending against Company
or any of the Subsidiaries or to the best knowledge of Company, threatened
against any of them, (b) no strike or work stoppage in existence or threatened
involving Company or any of the Subsidiaries and (c) to the best knowledge of
Company, no union representation question existing with respect to the employees
of Company or any of the Subsidiaries and, to the best knowledge of Company, no
union organization activity that is taking place, except (with respect to any
matter specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) above, either individually or in the
aggregate) such as is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.21 hereto, there are no collective bargaining

nor any Subsidiary of a Credit Party has suffered any strikes, walkouts or work
stoppages within the last three (3) years.

                  4.22     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Company, each of the
Subsidiaries and each of their respective ERISA Affiliates are in compliance
with all applicable provisions and requirements of ERISA and the Internal
Revenue Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with
respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, and have performed all their obligations
under each Employee Benefit Plan. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service indicating that
such Employee Benefit Plan is so qualified and nothing has occurred subsequent
to the issuance of such determination letter which would cause such Employee
Benefit Plan to lose its qualified status. No liability to the PBGC (other than
required premium payments), the Internal Revenue Service (with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan), any Employee Benefit Plan (excluding routine
contributions) or any trust established under Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
ERISA Affiliates. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur. Except to the extent required under Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue
Code or similar state laws, no Employee Benefit Plan provides health or welfare
benefits (through the purchase of insurance or otherwise) for any retired or
former employee of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates. The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under
each Pension Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates (determined as of the end of the
most recent plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for
funding purposes in the most recent actuarial valuation for such Pension Plan),
did not exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Pension Plan.
As of the most recent valuation date for each Multiemployer Plan for which the
actuarial report is available, the potential liability of Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates for a complete withdrawal
from such Multiemployer Plan (within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA), when
aggregated with such potential liability for a complete withdrawal from all
Multiemployer Plans, based on information available pursuant to Section 4221(e)
of ERISA. is zero. Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each of their ERISA
Affiliates have complied with the requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with
respect to each Multiemployer Plan and are not in material "default" (as defined
in Section 4219(c)(5) of ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer
Plan. No breach of this Section 4.22 shall arise solely by reason of any of the
aforementioned statements being false to the extent it would not individually or
in the aggregate result, or might reasonably be expected to result, in liability
of Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
in excess $1,000,000 during the term hereof.

                  4.23     CERTAIN FEES. No broker's or finder's fee or
commission will be payable with respect hereto or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                           (b)      Each Credit Party has caused to be
accurately prepared and filed (or obtained extensions for) all applicable cost

                           (c)      Each Credit Party participates in an
internal comprehensive compliance program with respect to all applicable
statutes, regulations and orders of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by,
all Governmental Authorities.

                  4.27     DISCLOSURE. No statement or information contained in

aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
and that have not been disclosed herein or in such other documents, certificates

operation of its Health Care Facilities, (ii) after receipt thereof, any notice
of any violation of any requirements of applicable law which would (with the
giving of notice, the passage of time, or both) cause any of the Health Care
Permits referred to in clause (i) to be modified, rescinded or revoked and which
Company does not reasonably expect to be able to cure within a reasonable period
of time, (iii) after receipt thereof, any notice, summons, citation or other
proceeding seeking to adversely modify in any material respect, revoke, or
suspend any Medicare Provider Agreement, Medicaid Provider Agreement, Medicare
certification or Medicaid certification applicable to any of the Health Care
Facilities of Company or any of its Guarantor Subsidiaries in any manner which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) after
obtaining knowledge thereof, any revocation or involuntary termination of any
Medicare Provider Agreement, Medicaid Provider Agreement, Medicare certification
or Medicaid certification applicable to any of the Health Care Facilities of
Company or any of its Guarantor Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected

Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries that are Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiaries to,
at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence and all
rights and franchises, licenses and permits material to its business; provided,
no Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to preserve any
such existence, right or franchise, licenses or permits of any Subsidiary if
such Person's board of directors (or similar governing body) shall determine
that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the
business of such Person, and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any
material respect to such Person or to Lenders; provided, further, that, in the
case that such Subsidiary is a Guarantor Subsidiary, such Person shall have
given Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent 30 days' prior written
notice of the cessation of preservation of any such existence, right or
franchise, license or permit.

                  5.3      PAYMENT OF TAXES AND CLAIMS. Each Credit Party will,
and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay all Taxes imposed upon it or any
of its properties or assets or in respect of any of its income, businesses or
franchises before any penalty or fine accrues thereon, and all claims (including
claims for labor, services, materials and supplies) for sums that have become
due and payable and that by law have or may become a Lien upon any of its
properties or assets, prior to the time when any penalty or fine shall be
incurred with respect thereto; provided, no such Tax or claim need be paid if it
is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings timely instituted
and diligently conducted, so long as (a) adequate reserve or other appropriate
provision, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been made
therefor, and (b) in the case of a charge or claim which has or may become a
Lien against any of the Collateral, such contest proceedings conclusively
operate to stay the sale of any portion of the Collateral to satisfy such Tax or
claim. No Credit Party will, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, file
or consent to the filing of any consolidated income Tax return with any Person
(other than Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

                  5.4      MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. Each Credit Party will,

excepted, all material properties used or useful in the business of Company and
its Subsidiaries (other than the PHCMI Group Members for so long as they are

insurance with respect to liabilities, losses or damage in respect of the
assets, properties and businesses of Company and its Subsidiaries as may
customarily be carried or maintained under similar circumstances by Persons of
established reputation engaged in similar businesses, in each case in such
amounts (giving effect to self-insurance), with such deductibles, covering such
risks and otherwise on such terms and conditions as shall be customary for such
Persons. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company will maintain

Property that is located in a community that participates in the National Flood
Insurance Program, in each case in compliance with any applicable regulations of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, (ii) casualty insurance on
the Collateral insuring against all risk of loss or damage including, without

insurance, with such insurance companies, in such amounts, with such
deductibles, and covering such risks as are at all times carried or maintained

similar circumstances by Persons of established reputation of the same or
similar size engaged in similar businesses or as otherwise may be reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and Administrative Agent. Each such policy
of insurance shall (i) name Collateral Agent, on behalf of Secured Parties as an
additional insured thereunder as its interests may appear, (ii) in the case of
each casualty insurance policy and each physical damage insurance policy,
contain a loss payable clause or endorsement, satisfactory in form and substance

Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, to adjust losses and
claims with respect to any Collateral or Real Estate Asset, and as an additional
insured for liability insurance, provide for at least thirty (30) days' prior
written notice to Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent of any
modification or cancellation of such policy, (iii) state that neither the
Agents, any of the Lenders, nor any other Secured Party shall be responsible for
premiums, commissions, club calls, assessments or advances, and (iv) be
reasonably satisfactory in all other respects (including deductibles) to

authorized representatives of the insurer, at all times prior to policy
termination, cessation or cancellation.

                           (d)      Maintain such other insurance or
self-insurance as may be required by applicable laws or any material Contractual
Obligation to which any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof is a party, and
maintain in respect of the Collateral such other insurance or self-insurance as
either Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may reasonably request.

                           (e)      The Company may only make payments into the
Insurance Concentration Account in the ordinary course of business consistent
with historical practices of Company in an aggregate amount together with the
aggregate amount of any Investments pursuant to Section 6.7(h) not in excess of
the reserves as shall be required by GAAP and as shall have been approved by
Company's Board of Directors after taking into account any advice of Company's
actuarial consultants and auditors; provided that as of the date of such
payment, (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing or would result from the consummation of such payment, (ii) Company

of one or more Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiaries in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, to make Investments pursuant to Section 6.7(h); and
(iii) to the prepayment, in whole or in part, of the Term Loans pursuant to
Section 2.13(a).

                  5.6      INSPECTIONS. Each Credit Party will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, permit any authorized representatives designated by
any Lender or any Agent to visit and inspect any of the properties of any Credit
Party and any of its respective Subsidiaries, to inspect, copy and take extracts

affairs, finances and accounts with its and their officers and independent
public accountants, all upon reasonable notice and at such reasonable times
during normal business hours and as often as may reasonably be requested,
provided that all visits to and inspections shall be conducted in a manner
calculated to minimize any disruption to the Credit Parties' operations and

provided, further, that (i) no Credit Party shall be deemed to be in breach of
this Section 5.6 for failure to comply with any Lender or Agent's request solely
to the extent that (x) compliance with such request would violate the Health
Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as in effect at any
time of determination and (y) such Lender or Agent has refused, following
request by such Credit Party, to execute a "business associate" agreement or
such other confidentiality agreement which would avoid such violation, (ii) so
long as no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the Credit
Parties shall not be required to reimburse the costs or expenses incurred by
such representatives of any Lender or any Agent in conducting in each case more
than one (1) such visits or inspections (which may include up to ten (10) Health
Care Facilities and any other facility reasonably requested by the Collateral
Agent having Medicaid/Medicare survey issues) in any Fiscal Year and (iii) upon
the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the
Collateral Agent shall be permitted to conduct any and all visits, inspections
and collateral audits as it deems appropriate in its reasonable discretion, and
Credit Parties shall be required to reimburse the Collateral Agent for the
reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by it and its
representative in conducting all such visits and inspections.

and shall cause each of its Guarantor Subsidiaries and all other Persons, if
any, on or occupying any Health Care Facility to comply, with the requirements
of all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental

necessary for the lawful conduct of its business or operations where now
conducted and as planned to be conducted, including the ownership and operation

                           (a)      In the event after the Closing Date that any

the ownership interests of such Foreign Subsidiary are owned by Company or by
any wholly owned Domestic Subsidiary thereof, Company shall, or shall cause such
Domestic Subsidiary to, deliver, all such documents, instruments, agreements,
and certificates as are similar to those described in Sections 3.1(d), and
Company shall take, or shall cause such Domestic Subsidiary to take, all of the
actions referred to in Section 3.1(j)(i) necessary to grant and to perfect a

Parties, under the Pledge and Security Agreement in such ownership interests,
provided that in no event shall such Domestic Subsidiary be required to pledge
ownership interests exceeding sixty-five percent (65%) of its total ownership
interests in such Foreign Subsidiary. With respect to each such Subsidiary,
Company shall promptly send to Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent written
notice setting forth with respect to such Person (i) the date on which such
Person became a Subsidiary of Company, and (ii) all of the data required to be
set forth in Schedules 4.1 and 4.2 with respect to all Subsidiaries of Company;

insurance, reinsurance, insurance fronting arrangements, material contracts and
investments proposed to be entered into by any such Subsidiary. Upon receipt of
such notice, Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, designate such

not designated by Administrative Agent be an Approved Captive Insurance
Subsidiary; provided that such written notice shall be deemed to supplement
Schedules 4.1 and 4.2 for all purposes hereof.

of Secured Parties, then contemporaneously with acquiring such Material Real

(b) if either such Agent so requests, the applicable Credit Party shall promptly
execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent, a Mortgage and such other
documents, instruments as such Persons shall reasonably request with respect to
such Material Real Estate Asset; provided, however that, in the case of any
Leasehold Property, such obligation to deliver a Mortgage shall be contingent
upon such Credit Party's obtaining and delivering to the Collateral Agent a
Landlord Consent and Estoppel and evidence that such Leasehold Property is a
Recorded Leasehold Interest and for which such Credit Party agrees to use
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain (it being acknowledged and agreed
that "commercially reasonable best efforts" shall not be construed to require
the payment by any Credit Party of any fee or other consideration for such
Landlord Consent and Estoppel other than reimbursement of legal expenses
actually incurred by landlords). In addition to the foregoing, the relevant
Credit Party shall, at the request of Requisite Lenders, deliver, from time to
time, to Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent such appraisals as are
required by law or regulation of Real Estate Assets with respect to which
Collateral Agent has been granted a Lien.

Party shall designate, or permit the designation of, any Indebtedness (other
than under this Agreement or other Credit Documents) as "Designated Senior
Indebtedness" for the purposes of the definition of the same or the
subordination provisions contained in the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture,
Refinancing Note Indenture or any documents governing any other Subordinated
Indebtedness without the consent of Administrative Agent.

other agreement which is material to the Credit Parties taken as a whole and
diligently protect and enforce the rights of the Credit Parties and their
Subsidiaries under all such agreements in a manner consistent with prudent
business judgment and subject to the terms and conditions of such agreements;

                           (b)      promptly provide any Agents copies of any
and all agreements amending, altering, modifying, waiving or supplementing in
any material respect the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture, any other Related
Agreement and any Material Contract; and

                           (c)      except where the failure to participate or
comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
continue its participation in all Third Party Payor Arrangements and comply with
all rules, regulations, standard procedures and decrees necessary to constitute
its participation in such Third Party Payor Arrangements and prepare and file
all applicable cost reports with respect to such Third Party Payor Arrangements.

cause to be maintained an integrated cash management system in accordance with
Sections 4.3(b)(ii) and 4.4(c) of the Pledge and Security Agreement and the

system reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent.

                           (b)      So long as no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Credit Parties shall have free access to the
funds in the Concentration Accounts. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, Administrative Agent (for the benefit of
the Secured Parties), subject to applicable law, shall have the right to direct
the Collateral Agent to establish sole dominion and control over the
Concentration Accounts, and the balances in such accounts may be applied toward
the payment of the Obligations in accordance with the provisions hereof.

                  5.15     FURTHER ASSURANCES. At any time or from time to time
upon the request of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, each Credit Party

documents and do such other acts and things as Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent may reasonably request in order to effect fully the purposes of
the Credit Documents, including providing Lenders with any information
reasonably requested pursuant to Section 10.20. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each Credit Party shall take such actions as

customary for comparable high-yield debt securities) prior to the date that is
six months after the Term Loan Maturity Date, and (E) such Indebtedness shall
otherwise, taken as a whole, be on terms no less favorable to the Lenders than
the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes; and (ii) after giving effect to the

time of acquisition of such asset by a Credit Party or a Subsidiary of a Credit

                           (d)      Certain Calculations. With respect to any
period during which a Permitted Acquisition or an Asset Sale or other
disposition of a Health Care Facility has occurred (each, a "SUBJECT
TRANSACTION"), Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and the components of Consolidated
Fixed Charges shall be calculated with respect to such period on a pro forma
basis reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent (including pro forma
adjustments arising out of events which are directly attributable to a specific
transaction, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing
impact, in each case determined on a basis consistent with Article 11 of
Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act and as interpreted by the
staff of the SEC, which would include cost savings resulting from head count
reduction, closure of facilities and similar restructuring charges, which pro
forma adjustments shall be certified by the chief financial officer of Company)
using the historical audited financial statements of any business so acquired or
to be acquired or sold or to be sold (or if no such audited financial statements
are available, to the extent reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent
using the historical unaudited financial statements of the relevant business)
and the consolidated financial statements of Company and its Subsidiaries which
shall be reformulated as if such Subject Transaction, and any Indebtedness
incurred or repaid in connection therewith, had been consummated or incurred or
repaid at the beginning of such period (and assuming that such Indebtedness
bears interest during any portion of the applicable measurement period prior to
the relevant acquisition at the weighted average of the interest rates
applicable to outstanding Loans incurred during such period).

                  6.9      FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES; DISPOSITION OF ASSETS;
ACQUISITIONS. No Credit Party shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries

or dissolve itself (or suffer any liquidation or dissolution), or convey, sell,
lease or sub-lease (as lessor (other than with respect to Permitted Ancillary
Leases) or sublessor), transfer or otherwise dispose of, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, all or any part of its business, assets or property of
any kind whatsoever, whether real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or
intangible, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or acquire by purchase or
otherwise (other than purchases, leases or other acquisitions of inventory,
materials and equipment in the ordinary course of business and operating leases
of real property for use in the business of the Credit Parties) the business,
property or fixed assets of, or stock or other evidence of beneficial ownership

conveyed, sold, leased, transferred or otherwise disposed of, in one transaction
or a series of transactions, to Company or any Guarantor;

notes or other debt Securities and valued at fair market value in the case of
other non-Cash proceeds) (i) when aggregated with the proceeds of all other
Asset Sales made within the same Fiscal Year, are less than $35,000,000;
provided (i) the consideration received for such assets shall be in an amount
equal to the fair market value thereof, determined in good faith by the Board of

Party, (ii) no less than 75% thereof shall be paid in Cash, (iii) for any single

Certificate at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of sale (or such
shorter period as Administrative Agent may agree to from time to time),

during the prior twelve month period, and (ii) less than $75,000,000 in the
aggregate from the Closing Date to the date of determination; provided that in
no event shall any Investment in any business or line of business deemed
"reasonably related" to the Closing Date business or lines of business of
Company pursuant to clause (vi) of the definition of Permitted Acquisitions (as
opposed to any business or line of business actually engaged in by the Credit
Parties on the Closing Date) exceed $2,500,000 during the term of this
Agreement;

substantially concurrent exchange for other assets to be used in the business
(such newly acquired asset or assets a "SWAPPED ASSET"); provided, however, that
(i) the aggregate LTM EBITDA for all Swapped Assets (determined for each Swapped
Asset as of the time of exchange thereof) during the term of this Agreement
shall not exceed $25,000,000; (ii) after giving effect to the asset swap on a
pro forma basis, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(iii) LTM EBITDA for the Swapped Asset or aggregate LTM EBITDA for a related
series of Swapped Assets shall be at least 90% of LTM EBITDA for the asset or
related series of assets exchanged therefor; (iv) all aspects of the asset swap
(including, without limitation, the calculation of LTM EBITDA in connection
therewith) shall be satisfactory to Administrative Agent in their sole
discretion; (v) prior to consummating any such asset swap, Company shall deliver

(vi) prior to consummating any such asset swap, Company shall have provided
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent demonstrating
satisfaction of the requirements of the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture or
Refinancing Note Indenture (as the case may be) relating to such asset swap;

of all of its interests in the Capital Stock of any of the Subsidiaries in
compliance with the provisions of Section 6.9, no Credit Party shall, nor shall
it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (a) directly or indirectly sell, assign,
pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Capital Stock of any of the
Guarantor Subsidiaries or any Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary, except to
qualify directors if required by applicable law; or (b) permit any of its
Subsidiaries directly or indirectly to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise
encumber or dispose of any Capital Stock of any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries or
any Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary, except to another Credit Party
(subject to the restrictions on such disposition otherwise imposed hereunder),
or to qualify directors if required by applicable law.

                  6.11     SALES AND LEASE-BACKS. No Credit Party shall, nor
shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, become
liable as lessee or as a guarantor or other surety with respect to any lease of
any property (whether real, personal or mixed), whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, which such Credit Party (a) has sold or transferred or is to sell or
to transfer to any other Person (other than Company or any of the Guarantor
Subsidiaries), or (b) intends to use for substantially the same purpose as any
other property which has been or is to be sold or transferred by such Credit
Party to any Person (other than Company or any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries) in
connection with such lease.

                  6.12     TRANSACTIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND AFFILIATES. No
Credit Party shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or

Capital Stock of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with any Affiliate of
Company or of any such holder, on terms that are less favorable to Company or
that Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that might be obtained at the
time from a Person who is not such a holder or Affiliate; provided, the
foregoing restriction shall not apply to (a) any transaction between Company and
any Guarantor; (b) reasonable and customary fees paid to members of the board of
directors (or similar governing body) of Company and its Subsidiaries; (c)
compensation arrangements for officers and other employees of Company and its
Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business; and (d)
transactions described in Schedule 6.12.

                  6.13     CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

                           (a)      From and after the Closing Date, no Credit
Party shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, engage in any
business other than the businesses engaged in by any Credit Party on the Closing
Date and similar or related businesses.

                           (b)      (i) Each Credit Party shall ensure that (1)
from and after the Closing Date, each of its Subsidiaries which is an Approved
Captive Insurance Subsidiary is a wholly owned Subsidiary of a Guarantor
Subsidiary, which Guarantor Subsidiary shall not engage in any business
activities or own any assets or properties other than the Capital Stock of such
Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary and otherwise as incident to its existence
as a holding company; and (2) from and after the Closing Date, each of its
Subsidiaries which is an Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary shall not engage
in any business other than (or have any Contractual Obligation or own any assets
or properties (excluding Cash and Cash Equivalents) other than) in connection
with insurance fronting arrangements entered into with financially sound and
reputable insurers for the sole purpose of the Credit Parties satisfying the
requirements of Section 5.5 hereof; (ii) no Approved Captive Insurance
Subsidiary or its direct parent, shall directly or indirectly, create, incur,
assume or guaranty, or otherwise become or remain directly or indirectly liable
with respect to any Indebtedness (other than the Obligations and the Senior
Subordinated Notes); and (iii) no Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary or its
direct parent, shall have any employees, material Contractual Obligations,
Investments, accounts, liabilities, claims or assets other then incidental to
the business of such entities as described in (i) above.

                  6.14     AMENDMENTS OR WAIVERS OF CERTAIN RELATED AGREEMENTS.
No Credit Party shall nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, agree to
any material amendment, restatement, supplement or other modification to, or
waiver of, any of its material rights, interests or obligations under any
Related Agreement after the Closing Date without in each case obtaining the
prior written consent of Requisite Lenders (or in the case of any Related
Agreement relating to the Omega Loan, by Administrative Agent) to such
amendment, restatement, supplement or other modification or waiver. Without
limitation to the generality of the foregoing, no Credit Party shall, nor shall
it permit any of its Guarantor Subsidiaries to, so amend or change the terms of
any Related Agreement, or make any payment consistent with any such amendment
thereof or change thereto without the aforesaid consent of the Required Lenders
or Administrative Agent (as applicable), if the effect of such amendment or
change is to increase the interest rate

                                      122

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT

under such Related Agreement, change any dates upon which payments of principal
or interest are due thereon, make stricter any event of default (or amend,
modify or supplement the definition thereof) or condition to an event of default
with respect thereto, change the redemption, prepayment or defeasance provisions
thereof, change the subordination provisions of any such Related Agreement (or
of any guaranty in respect thereof), or if the effect of such amendment or
change, together with all other amendments or changes made, is to increase
materially the obligations of the obligor thereunder or to confer any additional
rights on the holders of such Indebtedness under such Related Agreement (or a
trustee or other representative on their behalf) which would be adverse to any
Credit Party or Lenders; provided that an increase in the principal amount of
the Senior Subordinated Notes up to an aggregate $300,000,000 on the same terms
as the Senior Subordinated Notes issued on the Closing Date shall not be deemed
to be so adverse.

                  6.15     JOINT VENTURES OR PARTNERSHIPS. Company shall not,
nor shall it permit any other Credit Party to enter into or be party to any
Joint Venture (including, without limitation, by way of selling the Capital
Stock of a Subsidiary), unless (a) (i) any interest received by a Credit Party
in such Joint Venture is pledged to the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the
Secured Parties) pursuant hereto or (ii) the interest received by a Credit Party
in such Joint Venture is wholly owned by a Joint Venture Holding Company and (b)
is permitted by Sections 6.7(g) or (k).

                  6.16     FISCAL YEAR. No Credit Party shall, nor shall it
permit any of its Subsidiaries to change its Fiscal Year-end from December 31.

shall (i) fail to maintain in effect all Health Care Permits and Reimbursement
Approvals necessary to the operation of its business, or (ii) shall engage in
any activity that (a) constitutes or, with the giving of notice, the passage of
time, or both, would result in a material violation of, any Health Care Permit
necessary for the lawful conduct of its business or operations or (b)
constitutes or, with the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both, would
result in the loss by any Health Care Facility owned, leased, managed or
operated by Company or any of its Guarantor Subsidiaries of the right to
participate in, and receive payment under, the appropriate Medicare, Medicaid
and related reimbursement programs, and any similar state or local
government-sponsored program, to the extent that such Credit Party has decided
to participate in any such program, and to receive reimbursement from private
and commercial payers and health maintenance organizations to the extent
applicable thereto, in each case under (i) and (ii), except where the loss of
such Health Care Permit or rights to participate in or receive payments under
such programs could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

SECTION 7. GUARANTY

                  7.1      GUARANTY OF THE OBLIGATIONS. Subject to the
provisions of Section 7.2, Guarantors jointly and severally hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally

                                      123

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT
434546.21-New York Server 3A - MSW

<PAGE>

guaranty to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Beneficiaries
the due and punctual payment in full of all Obligations when the same shall
become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration,
acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but
for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. Section 362(a)) (collectively, the "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS").

                  7.2      CONTRIBUTION BY GUARANTORS. All Guarantors desire to
allocate among themselves (collectively, the "CONTRIBUTING GUARANTORS"), in a
fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under this Guaranty.
Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made on any date by a
Guarantor (a "FUNDING GUARANTOR") under this Guaranty that exceeds its Fair
Share as of such date, such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a
contribution from each of the other Contributing Guarantors in the amount of
such other Contributing Guarantor's Fair Share Shortfall as of such date, with
the result that all such contributions will cause each Contributing Guarantor's
Aggregate Payments to equal its Fair Share as of such date. "FAIR SHARE" means,
with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, an
amount equal to (a) the ratio of (i) the Fair Share Contribution Amount with
respect to such Contributing Guarantor to (ii) the aggregate of the Fair Share
Contribution Amounts with respect to all Contributing Guarantors multiplied by
(b) the aggregate amount paid or distributed on or before such date by all
Funding Guarantors under this Guaranty in respect of the obligations Guaranteed.
"FAIR SHARE SHORTFALL" means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any
date of determination, the excess, if any, of the Fair Share of such
Contributing Guarantor over the Aggregate Payments of such Contributing
Guarantor. "FAIR SHARE CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT" means, with respect to a
Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, the maximum aggregate
amount of the obligations of such Contributing Guarantor under this Guaranty
that would not render its obligations hereunder or thereunder subject to
avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11
of the United States Code or any comparable applicable provisions of state law;
provided, solely for purposes of calculating the "FAIR SHARE CONTRIBUTION
AMOUNT" with respect to any Contributing Guarantor for purposes of this Section
7.2, any assets or liabilities of such Contributing Guarantor arising by virtue
of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification or any rights to
or obligations of contribution hereunder shall not be considered as assets or
liabilities of such Contributing Guarantor. "AGGREGATE PAYMENTS" means, with
respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount
equal to (1) the aggregate amount of all payments and distributions made on or
before such date by such Contributing Guarantor in respect of this Guaranty
(including, without limitation, in respect of this Section 7.2), minus (2) the
aggregate amount of all payments received on or before such date by such
Contributing Guarantor from the other Contributing Guarantors as contributions
under this Section 7.2. The amounts payable as contributions hereunder shall be
determined as of the date on which the related payment or distribution is made
by the applicable Funding Guarantor. The allocation among Contributing
Guarantors of their obligations as set forth in this Section 7.2 shall not be
construed in any way to limit the liability of any Contributing Guarantor
hereunder. Each Guarantor is a third party beneficiary to the contribution
agreement set forth in this Section 7.2.

                                      124

<PAGE>

                  7.3      PAYMENT BY GUARANTORS. Subject to Section 7.2,
Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree, in furtherance of the foregoing
and not in limitation of any other right which any Beneficiary may have at law
or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of
Company to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall
become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration,
acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but
for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. Section 362(a)), Guarantors will upon demand pay, or cause to be
paid, in Cash, to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of Beneficiaries,
an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of all Guaranteed
Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest on such
Guaranteed Obligations (including interest which, but for Company's becoming the
subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such
Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed against Company for
such interest in the related bankruptcy case) and all other Guaranteed
Obligations then owed to Beneficiaries as aforesaid.

                  7.4      LIABILITY OF GUARANTORS ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor
agrees that its obligations hereunder are irrevocable, absolute, independent and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance which constitutes a
legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than payment in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing and without
limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows:

                           (a)      this Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when
due and not of collectibility. This Guaranty is a primary obligation of each
Guarantor and not merely a contract of surety;

                           (b)      Administrative Agent may enforce this
Guaranty upon the occurrence of an Event of Default notwithstanding the
existence of any dispute between Company and any Beneficiary with respect to the
existence of such Event of Default;

                           (c)      the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder
are independent of the obligations of Company and the obligations of any other
guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the obligations of Company, and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against such Guarantor
whether or not any action is brought against Company or any of such other
guarantors and whether or not Company is joined in any such action or actions;

                           (d)      payment by any Guarantor of a portion, but
not all, of the Guaranteed Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or
abridge any Guarantor's liability for any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations
which has not been paid. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if
Administrative Agent is awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce any
Guarantor's covenant to pay a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations, such
judgment shall not be deemed to release such Guarantor from its covenant to pay
the portion of the Guaranteed Obligations that is not the subject of such suit,
and such judgment shall not, except to the extent satisfied by such Guarantor,
limit,

                                      125

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT

<PAGE>

affect, modify or abridge any other Guarantor's liability hereunder in respect
of the Guaranteed Obligations;

                           (e)      any Beneficiary, upon such terms as it deems
appropriate, without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or
enforceability hereof or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment,
discharge or termination of any Guarantor's liability hereunder, from time to
time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or
otherwise change the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse
any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed
Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of
the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other
guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations and take and hold security for the
payment hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) release, surrender, exchange,
substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify,
with or without consideration, any security for payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other
obligation of any Person (including any other Guarantor) with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held
by or for the benefit of such Beneficiary in respect hereof or the Guaranteed
Obligations and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or exercise any
other right or remedy that such Beneficiary may have against any such security,
in each case as such Beneficiary in its discretion may determine consistent
herewith or the applicable Hedge Agreement and any applicable security
agreement, including foreclosure on any such security pursuant to one or more
judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is
commercially reasonable, and even though such action operates to impair or
extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of
any Guarantor against Company or any security for the Guaranteed Obligations;
and (vi) exercise any other rights available to it under the Credit Documents or
the Hedge Agreements; and

                           (f)      this Guaranty and the obligations of
Guarantors hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to
any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason
(other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations), including the
occurrence of any of the following, whether or not any Guarantor shall have had
notice or knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert or
enforce or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay or
enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise
or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether
arising under the Credit Documents or the Hedge Agreements, at law, in equity or
otherwise) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating
thereto, or with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of
the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or
modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms or
provisions (including provisions relating to events of default) hereof, any of
the other Credit Documents, any of the Hedge Agreements or any agreement or
instrument executed pursuant thereto, or of any other guaranty or security for
the Guaranteed Obligations, in each case whether or not in accordance with the
terms hereof or such Credit Document, such Hedge Agreement or any agreement
relating to

                                      126

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT
434546.21-New York Server 3A - MSW

<PAGE>

such other guaranty or security; (iii) the Guaranteed Obligations, or any
agreement relating thereto, at any time being found to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in any respect; (iv) the application of payments received from any
source (other than payments received pursuant to the other Credit Documents or
any of the Hedge Agreements or from the proceeds of any security for the
Guaranteed Obligations, except to the extent such security also serves as
collateral for indebtedness other than the Guaranteed Obligations) to the
payment of indebtedness other than the Guaranteed Obligations, even though any
Beneficiary might have elected to apply such payment to any part or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (v) any Beneficiary's consent to the change,
reorganization or termination of the corporate structure or existence of Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and to any corresponding restructuring of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) any failure to perfect or continue perfection of a
security interest in any collateral which secures any of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (vii) any defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which Company may
allege or assert against any Beneficiary in respect of the Guaranteed
Obligations, including failure of consideration, breach of warranty, payment,
statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury;
and (viii) any other act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or
thing, which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any
Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  7.5      WAIVERS BY GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor hereby waives,
for the benefit of Beneficiaries: (a) any right to require any Beneficiary, as a
condition of payment or performance by such Guarantor, to (i) proceed against
Company, any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any other Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security
held from Company, any such other guarantor or any other Person, (iii) proceed
against or have resort to any balance of any Deposit Account or credit on the
books of any Beneficiary in favor of Company or any other Person, or (iv) pursue
any other remedy in the power of any Beneficiary whatsoever; (b) any defense
arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or
other defense of Company or any other Guarantor including any defense based on
or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the
cessation of the liability of Company or any other Guarantor from any cause
other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) any defense based
upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety
must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that
of the principal; (d) any defense based upon any Beneficiary's errors or
omissions in the administration of the Guaranteed Obligations, except behavior
which amounts to bad faith; (e) (i) any principles or provisions of law,
statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof
and any legal or equitable discharge of such Guarantor's obligations hereunder,
(ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's
liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs,
recoupments and counterclaims, and (iv) promptness, diligence and any
requirement that any Beneficiary protect, secure, perfect or insure any security
interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (f) notices, demands,
presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of
any action or inaction, including acceptance hereof, notices of default
hereunder, the Hedge Agreements or any agreement or instrument related thereto,
notices of any

                                      127

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT
434546.21-New York Server 3A - MSW

<PAGE>

renewal, extension or modification of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to Company and
notices of any of the matters referred to in Section 7.4 and any right to
consent to any thereof; and (g) any defenses or benefits that may be derived
from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or
sureties, or which may conflict with the terms hereof.

                  7.6      GUARANTORS' RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION, CONTRIBUTION, ETC.
Until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and
the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall
have expired or been cancelled, each Guarantor hereby waives any claim, right or
remedy, direct or indirect, that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have
against Company or any other Guarantor or any of its assets in connection with
this Guaranty or the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder,
in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under
contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and including without
limitation (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that
such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Company with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any
claim, right or remedy that any Beneficiary now has or may hereafter have
against Company, and (c) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any
collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Beneficiary. In addition,
until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and
the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall
have expired or been cancelled, each Guarantor shall withhold exercise of any
right of contribution such Guarantor may have against any other guarantor
(including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed Obligations, including,
without limitation, any such right of contribution as contemplated by Section
7.2. Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement
to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement,
indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of
subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may have against
Company or against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution
such Guarantor may have against any such other guarantor, shall be junior and
subordinate to any rights any Beneficiary may have against Company, to all
right, title and interest any Beneficiary may have in any such collateral or
security, and to any right any Beneficiary may have against such other
guarantor. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of any such
subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time
when all Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been finally and indefeasibly
paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on
behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent
for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the
Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the
terms hereof.

                  7.7      SUBORDINATION OF OTHER OBLIGATIONS. Any Indebtedness
of Company or any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor (the "OBLIGEE
GUARANTOR") is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Guaranteed
Obligations, and any such indebtedness collected or received by the Obligee
Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held
in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith
be paid over to Administrative Agent for

                                      128

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT
434546.21-New York Server 3A - MSW

<PAGE>

the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the Guaranteed
Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the
liability of the Obligee Guarantor under any other provision hereof.

                  7.8      CONTINUING GUARANTY. This Guaranty is a continuing
guaranty and shall remain in effect until all of the Guaranteed Obligations
shall have been paid in full and the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated
and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled. Each Guarantor
hereby irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty as to future
transactions giving rise to any Guaranteed Obligations.

                  7.9      AUTHORITY OF GUARANTORS OR COMPANY. It is not
necessary for any Beneficiary to inquire into the capacity or powers of any
Guarantor or Company or the officers, directors or any agents acting or
purporting to act on behalf of any of them.

                  7.10     FINANCIAL CONDITION OF COMPANY. Any Credit Extension
may be made to Company or continued from time to time, and any Hedge Agreements
may be entered into from time to time, in each case without notice to or
authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition
of Company at the time of any such grant or continuation or at the time such
Hedge Agreement is entered into, as the case may be. No Beneficiary shall have
any obligation to disclose or discuss with any Guarantor its assessment, or any
Guarantor's assessment, of the financial condition of Company. Each Guarantor
has adequate means to obtain information from Company on a continuing basis
concerning the financial condition of Company and its ability to perform its
obligations under the Credit Documents and the Hedge Agreements, and each
Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the
financial condition of Company and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of
nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby waives and
relinquishes any duty on the part of any Beneficiary to disclose any matter,
fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of Company now
known or hereafter known by any Beneficiary.

                  7.11     BANKRUPTCY, ETC.

                           (a)      So long as any Guaranteed Obligations remain
outstanding, no Guarantor shall, without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent acting pursuant to the instructions of Requisite Lenders,
commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy,
reorganization or insolvency case or proceeding of or against Company or any
other Guarantor. The obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall not be reduced,
limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any case or
proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of Company or any other
Guarantor or by any defense which Company or any other Guarantor may have by

as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are
rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from any Beneficiary as a
preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so
rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guaranteed Obligations for all purposes
hereunder.

consolidation) in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, the Guaranty
of such Guarantor or such successor in interest, as the case may be, hereunder
shall automatically be discharged and released without any further action by any
Beneficiary or any other Person effective as of the time of such Asset Sale.

not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity
is furnished; provided, in no event shall this sentence require any Lender to
indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty,
action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in excess of such Lender's
Pro Rata Share thereof; and provided further, this sentence shall not be deemed
to require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation,

in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement
or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold
at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on

to give such instructions upon delivery of any such funds, in the sole
discretion of Administrative Agent; provided, that in no event may Company give

rights pertaining to investments of funds in the Cash Collateral Account shall

the Credit Parties, Administrative Agent or any Beneficiaries, become subject to
the Lien set forth in this Section, be deemed Collateral for all purposes hereof
and be subject to the provisions of this Credit Agreement.

Party shall have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee. To the extent
that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in

violative of any law or public policy, the applicable Credit Party shall
contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under

incurred by Indemnitees or any of them. To the extent permitted by applicable

duty imposed by any applicable legal requirement) arising out of, in connection
with, arising out of, as a result of, or in any way related to, this Agreement
or any Credit Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of
the proceeds thereof or any act or omission or event occurring in connection

such claim or any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known
or suspected to exist in its favor.

                           (c)      The indemnification provisions set forth in

Credit and participations therein or with any other Credit Document,
irrespective of whether or not (a) such Lender shall have made any demand
hereunder or (b) the principal of or the interest on the Loans or any amounts in
respect of the Letters of Credit or any other amounts due hereunder shall have
become due and payable pursuant to Section 2 and although such obligations and

                           (c)      Right to Assign. Each Lender shall have the
right at any time to sell, assign or transfer all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitment or Loans owing to it or other Obligation (provided,
however, that each such assignment shall be of a uniform, and not varying,
percentage of all rights and obligations under and in respect of any Loan and
any related Commitments; provided, further, for the avoidance of doubt, that
nothing herein shall require a Lender to make pro rata assignments of both its
Revolving Commitments, Tranche B Term Loan Commitments and New Term Loan
Commitments which shall remain at all times independently assignable):

                                    (i)      to any Person meeting the criteria
         of clause (i) of the definition of the term of "Eligible Assignee" upon
         the giving of notice to Company and Administrative Agent; and

                                    (ii)     to any Person meeting the criteria
         of clause (ii) of the definition of the term of "Eligible Assignee"
         and, in the case of assignments of Revolving Loans or Revolving
         Commitments to any such Person, consented to by each of Company (except
         (i) during the existence of an Event of Default and (ii) assignments
         made by Administrative Agent, or at the direction of Administrative
         Agent, in connection with primary syndication on or prior to the date
         falling 21 days after the Closing Date), Administrative Agent and
         Issuing Bank (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
         delayed); provided, further each such assignment pursuant to this
         Section 10.6(c)(ii) shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than
         (A) $2,500,000 (or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by Company
         and Administrative Agent or as shall constitute the aggregate amount of
         the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans of the assigning Lender)
         with respect to the assignment of the Revolving Commitments and
         Revolving Loans and (B) $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be
         agreed to by Company and Administrative Agent or as shall constitute
         the aggregate amount of the Term Loan) with respect to the assignment
         of the Term Loan.

                           (d)      Mechanics. The assigning Lender and the
assignee thereof shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment
Agreement, together with (i) a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (or such
lesser amount as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent, and provided
further, that only one fee shall be payable in the case of contemporaneous
assignments to Related Funds), and (ii) such forms, certificates or other
evidence, if any, with respect to United States federal income

tax withholding matters as the assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be
required to deliver to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.20(c).

                           (e)      Notice of Assignment. Upon its receipt of a
duly executed and completed Assignment Agreement, together with the processing
and recordation fee referred to in Section 10.6(d) (and any forms, certificates
or other evidence required by this Agreement in connection therewith),
Administrative Agent shall record the information contained in such Assignment
Agreement in the Register, shall give prompt notice thereof to Company and shall
maintain a copy of such Assignment Agreement.

                           (f)      Representations and Warranties of Assignee.
Each Lender, upon execution and delivery hereof or upon executing and delivering
an Assignment Agreement, as the case may be, represents and warrants as of the
Closing Date or as of the applicable Effective Date (as defined in the
applicable Assignment Agreement) that (i) it is an Eligible Assignee; (ii) it
has experience and expertise in the making of or investing in commitments or
loans such as the applicable Commitments or Loans, as the case may be; and (iii)
it will make or invest in, as the case may be, its Commitments or Loans for its
own account in the ordinary course of its business and without a view to
distribution of such Commitments or Loans within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it being understood
that, subject to the provisions of this Section 10.6, the disposition of such
Commitments or Loans or any interests therein shall at all times remain within
its exclusive control).

                           (g)      Effect of Assignment. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Section 10.6, as of the "Effective Date" specified in the
applicable Assignment Agreement: (i) the assignee thereunder shall have the
rights and obligations of a "Lender" hereunder to the extent such rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment
Agreement and shall thereafter be a party hereto and a "Lender" for all purposes
hereof; (ii) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned thereby pursuant to such Assignment
Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the
termination hereof under Section 10.8) and be released from its obligations
hereunder (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all or the
remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations hereunder,
such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; provided, anything contained in
any of the Credit Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, (y) Issuing Bank
shall continue to have all rights and obligations thereof with respect to such
Letters of Credit until the cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit
and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder and (z) such assigning
Lender shall continue to be entitled to the benefit of all indemnities hereunder
as specified herein with respect to matters arising out of the prior involvement
of such assigning Lender as a Lender hereunder); (iii) the Commitments shall be
modified to reflect the Commitment of such assignee and any Revolving Commitment
of such assigning Lender, if any; and (iv) if any such assignment occurs after
the issuance of any Note hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the
effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable,
surrender its applicable Notes to Administrative Agent for cancellation, and
thereupon Company shall issue and deliver new Notes, if so requested by the
assignee and/or assigning Lender, to such

                                      147

assignee and/or to such assigning Lender, with appropriate insertions, to
reflect the new Revolving Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of the assignee
and/or the assigning Lender.

                           (h)      Participations. Each Lender shall have the
right at any time to sell one or more participations to any Person (other than
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates (other than an
Affiliate which is also a Lender or an Affiliate of any Lender) in all or any
part of its Commitments, Loans or in any other Obligation. The holder of any
such participation, other than an Affiliate of the Lender granting such
participation, shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to
take any action hereunder except with respect to any amendment, modification or
waiver that would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan, Note or
Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of Credit is not extended beyond the
Revolving Commitment Termination Date) in which such participant is
participating, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or
fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any
post-default increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof,
or increase the amount of the participant's participation over the amount
thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or
Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Commitment shall not
constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in
any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any participant
if the participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof), (ii)
consent to the assignment or transfer by any Credit Party of any of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all or substantially all
of the Collateral under the Collateral Documents (except as expressly provided
in the Credit Documents) supporting the Loans hereunder in which such
participant is participating. Company agrees that each participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.18(c), 2.19 and 2.20 to the same extent
as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
paragraph (c) of this Section; provided, (i) a participant shall not be entitled
to receive any greater payment under Section 2.19 or 2.20 than the applicable
Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
sold to such participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
participant is made with Company's prior written consent and (ii) a participant
that would be a Non-US Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the
benefits of Section 2.20 unless Company is notified of the participation sold to
such participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of Company, to
comply with Section 2.20 as though it were a Lender. To the extent permitted by
law, each participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.4 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.17 as though it were a Lender.

                           (i)      Certain Other Assignments. In addition to
any other assignment permitted pursuant to this Section 10.6, (i) any Lender may
assign and/or pledge all or any portion of its Loans, the other Obligations owed
by or to such Lender, and its Notes, if any, to secure obligations of such
Lender including, without limitation, any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral
security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System and any operating circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank;
provided, no Lender, as between Company and such Lender, shall be relieved of
any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment and pledge,
and provided further, in no event shall the applicable Federal Reserve Bank or

                                      148

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT

<PAGE>

trustee be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require the assigning
Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

                  10.7     INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS. All covenants hereunder
shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is
not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by
an exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another
covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if
such action is taken or condition exists.

                  10.8     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
AGREEMENTS. All representations, warranties and agreements made herein shall
survive the execution and delivery hereof and the making of any Credit
Extension. Notwithstanding anything herein or implied by law to the contrary,
the agreements of each Credit Party set forth in Sections 2.18(c), 2.19, 2.20,
10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in Sections 2.17 and
9.6 shall survive the payment of the Loans, the cancellation or expiration of
the Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and
the termination hereof, though such survival shall not be taken into account for
purposes of determining when the Agents are required to release the Collateral
in connection with the payment in full of the Loans and the termination of the
Revolving Commitment.

                  10.9     NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay
on the part of any Agent or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or
privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall impair such power,
right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence
therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or
privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power,
right or privilege. The rights, powers and remedies given to each Agent and each
Lender hereby are cumulative and shall be in addition to and independent of all
rights, powers and remedies existing by virtue of any statute or rule of law or
in any of the other Credit Documents or any of the Hedge Agreements. Any
forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such right, power or remedy or be
construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the further exercise of
any such right, power or remedy.

                  10.10    MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. Neither any Agent
nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of
any Credit Party or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of
the Obligations. To the extent that any Credit Party makes a payment or payments
to Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to Administrative Agent, on behalf of
Lenders), or Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or Lenders enforce any
security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or
payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any equitable
cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof
originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor
or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in

                                      149

<PAGE>

full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such
enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

                  10.11    SEVERABILITY. In case any provision in or obligation
hereunder or any Note shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                  10.12    OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; INDEPENDENT NATURE OF LENDERS'
RIGHTS. The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall be
responsible for the obligations or Commitment of any other Lender hereunder.
Nothing contained herein or in any other Credit Document, and no action taken by
Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute Lenders as a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. The
amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and
independent debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its
rights arising out hereof and it shall not be necessary for any other Lender to
be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

                  10.13    HEADINGS. Section headings herein are included herein
for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part hereof for any
other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

                  10.14    APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

                  10.15    CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
BROUGHT AGAINST ANY CREDIT PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING HERETO OR ANY OTHER
CREDIT DOCUMENT, OR ANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS, MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR
FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE, COUNTY AND CITY OF NEW
YORK. BY EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS AGREEMENT, EACH CREDIT PARTY, FOR ITSELF
AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY (a) ACCEPTS GENERALLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS; (b)
WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS; (c) AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ALL
PROCESS IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR
CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO THE APPLICABLE CREDIT PARTY AT ITS
ADDRESS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 10.1; (d) AGREES THAT SERVICE AS
PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (c) ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER
THE APPLICABLE CREDIT PARTY IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND

                                      150

OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT; AND (e)
AGREES AGENTS AND LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER
PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY CREDIT PARTY IN THE COURTS
OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

                  10.16    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT
DOCUMENTS OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS
LOAN TRANSACTION OR THE LENDER/COMPANY RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED.
THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL
DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS
AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP,
THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND
THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS WAIVER IN ITS RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS.
EACH PARTY HERETO FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS
JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS
IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING
(OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SECTION
10.16 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY
TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS HERETO OR
ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS
RELATING TO THE LOANS MADE HEREUNDER. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT
MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

                  10.17    CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Lender shall hold all
non-public information regarding Company, its Subsidiaries and their business
identified as such by Company and obtained by such Lender pursuant to the
requirements hereof in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures for
handling confidential information of such nature, it being understood and agreed
by each Credit Party that, in any event, a Lender may make (i) disclosures of
such information to Affiliates of such Lender and to their agents and advisors
(and to other persons authorized by a Lender or Agent to organize, present or
disseminate such information in connection with disclosures otherwise made in
accordance with this Section 10.17), (ii) disclosures of

                                      151

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT
434546.21-New York Server 3A - MSW

<PAGE>

such information reasonably required by any bona fide or potential assignee,
transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated assignment,
transfer or participation by such Lender of any Loans or any participations
therein or by any direct or indirect contractual counterparties (or the
professional advisors thereto) in Hedge Agreements (provided, such
counterparties and advisors are advised of and agree to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 10.17), (iii) disclosure to any rating agency when
required by it, provided that, prior to any disclosure, such rating agency shall
undertake in writing to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential
information relating to the Credit Parties received by it from any of the Agents
or any Lender, and (iv) disclosures required or requested by any governmental
agency or representative thereof or by the NAIC or pursuant to legal process;
provided, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each
Lender shall make reasonable efforts promptly to notify Company of any request
by any governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such
request in connection with any examination of the financial condition or other
routine examination of such Lender by such governmental agency) for disclosure
of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each party (and each
of their respective employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to
any and all persons, without limitations of any kind, the tax treatment and tax
structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials
of any kind (including opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to any
such party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, any
information relating to the tax treatment or tax structure shall remain subject
to the confidentiality provisions hereof (and the foregoing sentence shall not
apply) to the extent reasonably necessary to enable the parties hereto, their
respective Affiliates, and their and their respective Affiliates' directors and
employees to comply with applicable securities laws. For this purpose, "tax
structure" means any facts relevant to the federal income tax treatment of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement but does not include information
relating to the identity of any of the parties hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates.

                  10.18    USURY SAVINGS CLAUSE. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged with respect to any of the
Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the
nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful
Rate. If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding
sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the
outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the
Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the
amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of
interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In
addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest
due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than
the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated
rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect,
then to the extent permitted by law, Company shall pay to Administrative Agent
an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the
amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at
all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of
Lenders and Company to conform strictly to any

                                      152

CREDIT AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT

<PAGE>

applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or
receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest
Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if
previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the outstanding
amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to Company.

                  10.19    COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one
and the same instrument.

                  10.20    USA PATRIOT ACT. Each Lender hereby notifies the
Company that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Company, which
information includes the name and address of the Company and other information
that will allow such Lender to identify the Company in accordance with the Act.

                  10.21    EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement shall become effective
upon the execution of a counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto and
receipt by Company and Administrative Agent of written or telephonic
notification of such execution and authorization of delivery thereof.

                               OPINIONS OF COUNSEL

         Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit D not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement to which this
Exhibit D is attached.

A. GENERALLY.

         1. Company and each other Credit Party is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization
as identified in Schedule 4.1 to the Credit Agreement, has all requisite power
and authority to own and operate its properties, to carry on its business as now
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Credit Documents to
which it is a party and to carry out the transactions contemplated thereby, and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction
identified in Schedule 4.1 to the Credit Agreement. Schedule 4.1 correctly sets
forth the ownership interest of Company and each of its Subsidiaries in their
respective Subsidiaries.

         2. The execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents have
been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each Credit Party
that is a party thereto. The execution, delivery and performance by Credit
Parties of the Credit Documents to which they are parties and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do not and will not
violate any provision of any law or any governmental rule or regulation
applicable to Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of the Organizational
Documents of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any order, judgment or
decree of any court or other agency of government binding on Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; except as otherwise set forth in the Credit Agreement,
conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default under any Contractual Obligation of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than any Liens created under any of the Credit Documents in favor of
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders (the "SECURED
PARTIES")); or require any approval of stockholders or any approval or consent
of any Person under any Contractual Obligation of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such approvals or consents which will be obtained on or
before the Closing Date and disclosed in writing to Lenders, or as otherwise set
forth in the Credit Agreement.

         3. The execution, delivery and performance by Credit Parties of the
Credit Documents to which they are parties and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do not and will not require
any registration with, consent or approval of, or notice to, or other action to,
with or by, any federal, state or other governmental authority or regulatory
body except as otherwise set forth in the Credit Agreement, and except for
filings and recordings with respect to the Collateral to be made, or otherwise
delivered to Collateral Agent, as of the Closing Date.

                                  EXHIBIT D-1


<PAGE>

         4. Each Credit Document has been duly executed and delivered by each
Credit Party that is a party thereto and is the legally valid and binding
obligation of such Credit Party, enforceable against such Credit Party in
accordance with its respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting
creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to
enforceability.

         5. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to regulation
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the
Interstate Commerce Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or under any other
federal or state statute or regulation which may limit its ability to incur
Indebtedness or which may otherwise render all or any portion of the Obligations
unenforceable.

         6. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally,
or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for
the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. The pledge of the
Investment Property Collateral pursuant the Pledge and Security Agreement does
not violate Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.

         Opinions with respect to the Credit Documents may be subject to the
following qualifications:

                  (i)      enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
         insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
         creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
         (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law);

                  (ii)     certain of the remedial provisions, including
         waivers, with respect to the exercise of remedies contained in the
         Credit Documents may be unenforceable in whole or in part, but the
         inclusion of such provisions does not affect the validity of any Credit
         Document, taken as a whole; and

                  (iii)    counsel may assume that each Credit Document
         constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party to
         such agreement (other than Company and each other Credit Party)
         enforceable against each such party (other than Company or any other
         Credit Party ) in accordance with its terms.

B. COLLATERAL OPINIONS
