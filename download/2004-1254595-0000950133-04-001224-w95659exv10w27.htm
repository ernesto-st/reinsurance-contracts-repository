attached in any manner to the real estate; with Tenant as the party insured,
and with a waiver by the insurance company of all its rights to subrogation
against Landlord and Landlord&#146;s agents and employees. During the course of any
construction work by or on behalf of Tenant on or about the Premises, Tenant
will provide and keep in force builders &#147;all-risk&#148; insurance with extended
coverage in completed value, non-reporting form, and (if required by Landlord)
performance bonds to ensure completion of such work. In addition, Tenant shall
be responsible for obtaining and maintaining such other insurance coverages,
limits and/or endorsements as Landlord or any mortgagee of the Project may
reasonably require from time to time. All such policies shall be primary and
non-contributing with any coverage that Landlord may carry, shall name Landlord
(and/or Landlord&#146;s mortgagees and/or managing agent, if requested) as loss
payee or as additional insured (as the case may be), and shall contain a
long-form lender&#146;s loss payable endorsement providing for Landlord to receive
written notice at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to any alteration or
cancellation. Such insurance may be carried under a blanket policy or policies
provided that the proceeds from such policies shall not be less than would have
been available if the insurance had been obtained under separate or non-blanket
policies had been obtained under separate or non-blanket policies.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.02 Waivers</B>. Tenant hereby waives any right of recovery it may from time
to time have against Landlord with respect to liability for damage to property
covered by the insurance required to be carried by Tenant hereunder. Tenant
shall require its fire and extended coverage insurers from time to time to
include an express waiver of any right of subrogation which the insurer may
have against Landlord. Tenant shall furnish to Landlord from time to time upon
ten (10)&nbsp;days request a current duplicate original insurance policy, or
Evidence of Insurance in form ACORD 25-S or ACORD 27 (whichever is applicable),
evidencing the coverages and endorsements above required, failing which
Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the required
insurance on Tenant&#146;s behalf and one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the
amount incurred shall be due from Tenant as additional rent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.03 Tenant Not to Create Extra Insurance Hazards</B>. Tenant shall not keep
or do anything on the Premises or the Project which is prohibited by Landlord&#146;s
insurance policies or which will prevent Landlord from procuring such policies
in acceptable companies. If any act or omission of Tenant within the Project
causes an increase in Landlord&#146;s insurance premiums with acceptable insurers,
or in the coverages or endorsements Landlord is required to carry, Tenant shall
be responsible for the payment of any such increase as additional rent upon
demand.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.04 Indemnification by Tenant</B>. Tenant shall indemnify, save harmless
and defend Landlord and its agents from and against all claims, costs,

and person of Tenant and its agents) arising from or relating to (i)&nbsp;any
occurrence in, on or about the Premises, and any loading platform or other area
outside of the Premises exclusively allocated to Tenant&#146;s use, except to the
extent caused by the gross negligence of Landlord or its agents, (ii)&nbsp;Tenant&#146;s
use or occupancy of the Premises, or (iii)&nbsp;the negligence of Tenant, its agents
and invitees, or attributable to property of Tenant on the Common Areas.

Tenant assumes sole and full responsibility for, and will remedy at its cost,
all such violations, provided that Tenant must first obtain Landlord&#146;s written
approval of any remedial actions, which approval Landlord may not unreasonably
withhold. Tenant will not use, generate, release, store, treat, dispose of, or
otherwise deposit, in, on, under or about the Premises, any Hazardous
Materials, nor will Tenant permit or allow any third party to do so, without
Landlord&#146;s prior written consent. Landlord&#146;s election to conduct inspections
of the Premises is not approval of Tenant&#146;s use of the Premises or any
activities conducted thereon, and is not an assumption by Landlord of any
responsibility regarding Tenant&#146;s use of the Premises or Hazardous Materials.
Tenant&#146;s compliance with the terms of this Section&nbsp;6.03 and with all
Environmental Regulations is at Tenant&#146;s sole cost. Tenant will pay or
reimburse Landlord for any costs or expenses incurred by Landlord, including
reasonable attorney&#146;s, engineers&#146;, consultants&#146; and other experts&#146; fees and
disbursements incurred or payable to determine, review, approve, consent to or
monitor the requirements for compliance with Environmental Regulations,
including, without limitation, above and below ground testing. Landlord and
Landlord&#146;s Agents are hereby authorized to enter upon the Premises for such
purposes. Tenant will supply Landlord with historical and operational
information regarding the Premises, including without limitation, all reports
required to be filed with governmental agencies, as may be reasonably requested
by Landlord to facilitate site assessment, and will make available for meetings
with Landlord or Landlord&#146;s Agents, appropriate personnel having knowledge of
such matters. If Tenant fails to comply with the provisions of this Section
6.03, or if Landlord receives notice or information asserting the existence of
any Hazardous Materials, Landlord has the right, but not the obligation,
without in any way limiting Landlord&#146;s other rights and remedies, to enter upon
the Premises or to take such other actions Landlord deems necessary or
advisable to clean up, remove, resolve, or minimize the impact of any Hazardous
Materials on or affecting the Premises. Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand
as Additional Rent all reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by
Landlord in the exercise of any such rights. Tenant will notify Landlord in
writing, immediately upon the discovery, notice (from a governmental authority
or other entity) or reasonable grounds to suspect, by Tenant, Tenant&#146;s Agents,
its successors or assigns the presence in the Premises or the Building of any
Hazardous Materials or conditions that result in a violation of or could
reasonably be expected to violate this Section&nbsp;6.03, together with a full
description thereof. &#147;Environmental Regulations&#148; means any law, statute,
regulation, order or rule now or hereafter promulgated by any Governmental
Authority, whether local, state or federal, relating to air pollution, water
pollution, noise control or transporting, storing, handling, discharge,
disposal or recovery of on site or off site hazardous substances or materials,

or grant a license or concession, or otherwise transfer the whole or any part
of any Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord in each case,
which consent may be withheld in the Landlord&#146;s sole and absolute discretion.
Any request to transfer this Lease or any portion of the Premises shall be
accompanied by a check in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) to
help defray the cost of reviewing same. Landlord shall withhold consent if (i)
Tenant is in default of the Lease, (ii)&nbsp;the proposed transfer would violate a
provision of another lease or agreement, (iii)&nbsp;the proposed use would be
incompatible with the other uses in the Project or would increase parking or
utility requirements, (iv)&nbsp;the proposed transferee is not sufficiently
creditworthy or experienced; (v)&nbsp;Landlord&#146;s lender or Tenant&#146;s guarantor (if
any) refuses to consent, or (vi)&nbsp;any other factor exists which would make
Landlord&#146;s refusal reasonable under the circumstances. Tenant&#146;s request for
consent shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to allow Landlord to
make a decision based on the foregoing factors. Landlord shall have the right
to recapture the Premises proposed for transfer by written notice to Tenant
given within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the request for consent, but Landlord&#146;s
failure to exercise this right shall not constitute a consent to the transfer.
In the case of each transfer, Tenant shall cure any outstanding defaults prior
to the transfer date, and remain jointly and severally liable with the
transferee for the full and timely performance of each and every term, covenant
and condition of Tenant under the Lease. All cash or other proceeds whatsoever
payable by or on behalf of a transferee of this Lease or the Premises,
whensoever same may be payable, shall be deemed to be rent , and any such rent
in excess of the rentals payable by Tenant hereunder shall promptly be paid to
Landlord.

accomplished by a single transaction or a series of transactions) of any
partner or member owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the partnership or
company, or a dissolution or liquidation of the partnership or company, (ii)&nbsp;if
Tenant is a corporation, any dissolution, merger, consolidation or other
reorganization of Tenant, or the transfer of a controlling interest of the
capital stock of Tenant (whether accomplished by a single transaction or a
series of transactions), or (iii)&nbsp;any management arrangement by which
operational control is transferred to a person other than Tenant.

subordinate to all ground leases, mortgages, trust deeds or other financing

shall attorn to any purchaser, to the purchaser at any foreclosure, or to the
grantee of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and recognize such purchaser or

no further instruments shall be required to effect same. However, if requested
by Landlord, Tenant shall promptly from time to time within ten (10)&nbsp;days of
request execute a confirmation of such subordination in the form required by
Landlord. If any ground lessor, mortgagee or trustee notifies Tenant that it
elects to have the Lease be a prior lien, then this Lease shall be deemed to be
prior in lien to such ground lease, mortgage or trust deed. Tenant shall within

option reenter the Premises without terminating the Lease, relet the Premises

deficiency in the rent received by Landlord in accordance with the Lease, as
well as all costs relating to recovery and reletting the Premises, including
all leasing commissions, legal fees and costs plus all actual and consequential
damages, but if Landlord does not relet the Premises Tenant shall continue to
be responsible for the full payment of rentals in accordance with the Lease.
Landlord shall not be required to serve further notice or resort to legal
process prior to exercising its right of re-entry, and Tenant waives any
available rights of redemption. Landlord shall also have the right to terminate
this Lease and recover damages, even if Landlord has previously exercised its
right of re-entry. If Landlord elects to terminate, Landlord shall be entitled
to liquidated damages in an amount equal to (i)&nbsp;all sums owing hereunder up to
the date of termination, and (ii)&nbsp;accelerated rent discounted to present value
using an interest rate of five percent (5%), provided that Landlord will
forward to Tenant any net rentals received on reletting the Premises as they
are received, provided that Landlord shall incur no liability, and Tenant&#146;s
obligations hereunder shall not be diminished, by virtue of Landlord&#146;s failure
to relet. The foregoing remedies are in addition to any other remedies
available hereunder or at law.

failure to pay such amount when due shall constitute a monetary default.
