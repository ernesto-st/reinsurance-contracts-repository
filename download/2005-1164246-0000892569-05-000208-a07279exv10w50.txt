                               AMOUNTS AND TERMS

SECTION 2.1. COMMITMENT.

      (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, each
Lender, severally and not jointly, agrees to (i) make loans (each an "ADVANCE"
and collectively, the "ADVANCES") to Borrower pro rata in accordance with such
Lender's Percentage from time to time on and/or after the Closing Date, and (ii)
issue Letters of Credit to Borrower pro rata in accordance with such Lender's
Percentage from time to time on and/or after the Closing Date in accordance with
the terms and conditions of Sections 2.17, 2.18 and 2.19.

      (b) The Advances made pursuant hereto by the Lenders, together with the
Letter of Credit Usage at such time, shall not exceed an aggregate principal
amount outstanding at any one time of the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount the
Lenders have committed to lend to Borrower as set forth on Exhibit A, as the
same may be increased pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in Section
2.20 (the "COMMITMENT"), and the (ii) the Maximum Availability Amount. There may
not be more than one (1) Advance made on any day. Within the foregoing limits
and subject to the conditions set out in this Agreement, Borrower may borrow
Advances under this Section 2.1 and repay Advances under Section 2.8, but in no
event may Borrower reborrow Advances except as otherwise expressly permitted by
this Agreement.

      (c) The aggregate principal amount of each Advance hereunder shall be not
less than $500,000.

SECTION 2.2. ADVANCES.

      (a) The Lenders will make Advances for (and only for) the Permitted
Purposes subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, subject to satisfaction of all
conditions precedent to Advances set forth herein.

      (b) The initial Advance of the loan proceeds will be made upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article III of this Agreement, and
all subsequent Advances shall be made no more frequently than monthly
thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower may obtain not more than one
(1) additional Advance per month in connection with the closing of the
acquisition of one or more Mortgaged Properties.

SECTION 2.3. NOTICES OF BORROWING.

      (a) Whenever Borrower desires to receive an Advance hereunder, it shall
give the Agent at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of the
proposed Advance to be made hereunder, such notice to be given prior to 10:00
a.m. (Chicago time) on the date specified. Each such notice (each a "NOTICE OF
BORROWING") shall be in the form of Exhibit B, be irrevocable and shall specify
the principal amount of the Advance to be made and the date

                                       14
<PAGE>

(which shall be a Business Day) of the Advance. No Notice of Borrowing shall be
effective unless it is accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Agent that all of
the conditions to an Advance set forth in Article III hereof have been
satisfied.

      (b) Without in any way limiting Borrower's obligation to confirm in
writing any telephonic notice received from an Authorized Representative to the
Agent and the Lenders may act without liability upon the basis of telephonic
notice believed by the Agent in good faith to be from Borrower prior to receipt
of written confirmation. In each such case, Borrower hereby waives the right to
dispute Agent's record of the terms of such telephonic Notice of Borrowing,
except to the extent contradicted by Borrower's subsequent written confirmation
received prior to Agent and the Lenders having irrevocably acted in reliance on
the telephonic Notice of Borrowing.

SECTION 2.4. DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS. Agent shall promptly (but in no event less
than two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the Advance) notify each Lender
of its Percentage of each Advance and the date of such Advance. On the date so
specified, each Lender shall make available to Agent at the Payment Office no
later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) in immediately available funds an amount
equal to such Lender's Percentage of such Advance. No later than 1:00 p.m.
(Chicago time) on the date of each Advance, Agent will make available to
Borrower at the Payment Office the full amount of the Advance.

SECTION 2.5. PROMISSORY NOTES; COLLATERAL.

      (a) Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the
Advances made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more Promissory Notes
in the face amount of each such Lender's Percentage of the Commitment, with
blanks as to payee, date and principal amount appropriately completed. The
determination by Agent of the amount of principal outstanding hereunder or under
any Promissory Note shall, except for patent error, be final, conclusive and
binding upon Borrower for all purposes.

      (b) Each borrowing, prepayment and reborrowing hereunder shall be recorded
by Agent; provided, however, that no failure to make or any error in making a
recordation of an Advance shall in any way limit, affect or modify the
obligation of Borrower to repay any obligations, or the rights of Agent and the
Lenders to any amounts due under this Agreement, the Loan Documents or the
Promissory Notes.

      (c) Except as otherwise set forth in the Loan Documents, each item of
Collateral shall secure the payment and performance of all indebtedness and
obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, including without limitation, any
increased cost under Section 2.13 hereof, and each other Loan Document.

SECTION 2.6. INTEREST ON ADVANCES.

      (a) The unpaid principal amount of each Advance shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event will the Applicable Rate ever be less than four and 15/100 percent
(4.15%) per annum; provided, however, if Mortgagor satisfies the Rate Reduction
Conditions and during such time as the Rate Reduction Conditions remain
satisfied, then in no event will the Applicable Rate ever be less

                                       15
<PAGE>

than three and 90/100 percent (3.90%) per annum. The "APPLICABLE RATE" with
respect to each Advance shall be the Applicable Eurodollar Rate, provided that,
if Borrower makes a Base Rate Election, the Applicable Rate shall mean the
Applicable Base Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest on each Advance
shall accrue from and including the date of such Advance to but excluding the
date of any repayment thereof and shall be payable as follows:

            (i) with respect to Advances bearing interest at the Applicable Base
Rate, interest shall be payable (x) in arrears on the first day of each calendar
month at all times while any such Advances are outstanding, (y) at maturity
(whether by acceleration or otherwise), and (z) after maturity, on demand; and

            (ii) with respect to Advances bearing interest at the Applicable
Eurodollar Rate, interest shall be payable (x) in arrears on the first day of
each calendar month while any such Advances are outstanding, (y) at maturity and
(z) after maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise), on demand.

      (b) Borrower may elect from time to time to have the Applicable Base Rate
apply to any Advance by giving Agent written notice thereof in a Notice of
Borrowing (a "BASE RATE ELECTION").

      (c) If a Default or Event of Default exists hereunder, the Applicable Rate
shall mean the Default Rate. Additionally, overdue principal and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of each Advance, and all other
overdue amounts owing hereunder, shall bear interest for each day that such
amounts are overdue at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

      (d) Agent, upon determining the Applicable Eurodollar Rate for any
applicable Eurodollar Interest Rate Period, shall promptly notify by telephone
(confirmed in writing) or in writing Borrower thereof.

SECTION 2.7. EURODOLLAR RATE. If an Advance bears interest at the Applicable
Eurodollar Rate in accordance with the terms hereof, an interest period (each a
"EURODOLLAR RATE INTEREST PERIOD") shall be applicable thereto, which shall be a
period of up to three (3) months as selected by Borrower in the Notice of
Borrowing for such Advance, provided that:

      (a) the initial Eurodollar Rate Interest Period for any Advance shall
commence on the date of such Advance;

      (b) at the end of the initial Eurodollar Rate Interest Period, and each
subsequent Eurodollar Rate Interest Period for any Advance, Borrower shall be
permitted to select an additional Eurodollar Rate Interest Period for such
Advance by delivering a written notice thereof to Agent at any time prior to
12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of
the then-current Interest Period applicable to such Advance, provided that if no
Eurodollar Rate Interest Period selection is delivered to Agent by such time,
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected the existing Eurodollar Rate Interest
Period for such Advance of one month;

      (c) if a Eurodollar Rate Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day
which is not a Business Day, such Eurodollar Rate Interest Period shall expire
on the next succeeding

                                       16
<PAGE>

Business Day, provided that if any Eurodollar Rate Interest Period in respect of
an Advance (other than an Advance referred to in Section 2.12(b)(ii) or Section
2.13(b)(ii)) would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a
day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such
Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

      (d) any Eurodollar Rate Interest Period in respect of an Advance which
begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there
is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such
Interest Period) shall, subject to clause (v) below, end on the last Business
Day of a calendar month;

      (e) no Eurodollar Rate Interest Period shall extend beyond the Maturity
Date; and

      (f) there shall be no more than eight (8) Eurodollar Rate Interest Periods
in effect at any time.

SECTION 2.8. PREPAYMENTS OF ADVANCES.

      (a) Borrower may prepay all outstanding Advances, any one Advance or any
portion of an Advance on any Business Day without penalty, premium or additional
charge, except as set forth in Section 2.15 hereof; provided that such
prepayment shall be at least equal to the lesser of $100,000 or the outstanding
amount of such Advance. Upon five (5) days' written notice to Agent, Borrower
may terminate the Commitment by prepaying all outstanding Advances and all other
amounts and fees due to Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, including, without limitation, Section 2.15 hereof.

      (b) Borrower shall be liable for all amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.15 with respect to a prepayment of an Advance on any date other than the last
day of the Eurodollar Rate Interest Period related to such Advance.

SECTION 2.9. MATURITY DATE. Borrower shall repay to Agent, for the account of
the Lenders, the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made by the Lenders
hereunder, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other
sums due and payable to the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
on the Maturity Date.

SECTION 2.10. PAYMENTS, ETC.

      (a) All payments under this Agreement shall be pro rated among the Lenders
in accordance with their Percentages and, shall be made by Borrower, without
defense, setoff, or counterclaim, to Agent not later than 12:00 noon (Chicago
time) on the date when due and shall be made in Dollars in immediately available
funds at the Payment Office and any funds received by Agent after such time
shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to have been paid on the
next succeeding Business Day. Agent shall thereafter cause to be distributed to
the Lenders, on the Business Day when paid, in like funds their Percentage of
payments so received. In the event Agent fails to cause such funds to be
distributed to any Lender on the same Business Day when paid (or deemed paid) to
Agent, Agent shall pay interest to such Lender on such amounts at the Federal
Funds Rate.

                                       17
<PAGE>

      (b) Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under the Promissory
Notes shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due
date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (unless a
Eurodollar Rate Interest Period expires on the next preceding Business Day
pursuant to Section 2.7(c), in which case the due date shall be the next
preceding Business Day) and, with respect to payments of principal, interest
thereon shall be payable at the Applicable Rate during such extension.

      (c) All computations of interest on the Advances and fees due under
Sections 2.19(b) and (c) shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for
the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each
determination by Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall, except for
patent error, be final, conclusive, and binding upon Borrower for all purposes.

      (d) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, all payments and
prepayments under this Agreement shall be applied as follows: (a) first, to
fees, expenses, costs and other similar amounts then due and payable to Agent
and the Lenders, including, without limitation any prepayment premium, exit fee
or late charges due hereunder, (b) second, to accrued and unpaid interest on the
outstanding Advances, (c) third, to the payment of principal due in the month in
which the payment or prepayment is made, if any, (d) fourth, to any escrows,
impounds or other amounts which may then be due and payable under the Loan
Documents, (e) fifth, to any other amounts then due Agent and/or Lenders
hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents, and (f) last, to the unpaid
principal balance of the outstanding Advances in the inverse order of maturity.
Any prepayment of Advances shall not extend or postpone the Maturity Date or
reduce the amount of any subsequent monthly payment of principal and interest
due hereunder. After an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
payments may be applied by Agent to amounts owed hereunder and under the Loan
Documents in such order as Agent shall determine, in its sole discretion.

SECTION 2.11. INTEREST RATE NOT ASCERTAINABLE, ETC. If Agent shall have
determined (which determination shall, except for patent error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon Borrower for all purposes) that on any date for
determining the Applicable Eurodollar Rate for any Eurodollar Rate Interest
Period, by reason of any circumstances affecting the interbank Eurodollar
market, or Agent's position in such market, adequate and fair means do not exist
for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the
definition of Applicable Eurodollar Rate, then, and in any such event, Agent
shall forthwith give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower of
such determination. Until Agent notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to the suspension described herein no longer exist, then (x) any Advance
made hereunder shall bear interest at the Applicable Base Rate then in effect
and (y) if any Advance affected is then outstanding, each such Advance shall
immediately convert into an Advance bearing interest at the Applicable Base Rate
then in effect.

SECTION 2.12. ILLEGALITY.

      (a) If any Lender (a "NOTIFYING LENDER") shall have determined at any time
that compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, rule or regulation,
or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Authority adopted or becoming effective after the
date hereof renders unlawful the making or continuance

                                       18
<PAGE>

of any Advance, the Notifying Lender shall give prompt notice (by telephone
confirmed in writing) to Agent, and Agent to Borrower of such determination.

      (b) Upon the giving of the notice to Agent and Borrower referred to in
Section 2.12(a) above, (i) Borrower's right to request and the Notifying
Lender's obligation to make Advances shall be immediately suspended, and (ii) if
the Notifying Lender's Advance affected is then outstanding, each such Advance
shall immediately convert into an Advance bearing interest at the Applicable
Base Rate, provided that, in such event, Borrower shall not be liable for any
costs referred to in Section 2.15(ii) hereof resulting solely by reason of such
conversion occurring prior to the last day of a Eurodollar Rate Interest Period.

SECTION 2.13. INCREASED COSTS.

      (a) If, by reason of (x) after the date hereof, the implementation of or
any change (including, without limitation, any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve or capital adequacy requirements) in, or in the
interpretation by any Governmental Authority or any other recognized authority
of, any law or regulation, or (y) the compliance with any guideline or request
from any central bank or other Governmental Authority or quasi-Governmental
Authority exercising control over banks or financial institutions generally
(whether or not having the force of law) adopted or becoming effective after the
date hereof:

            (i) any Lender (or its Lending Office) shall be subject to any tax,
duty, or other charge, with respect to the Advances or its obligation to make
Advances, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the
principal of or interest on the Advances or its obligation to make Advances
(except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender
or its Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's
principal executive office or Lending Office is located); or

            (ii) any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement
(including, without limitation, any reserve, special deposit, or similar
requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
any Lender or its Lending Office shall be imposed or deemed applicable or any
other condition affecting the Advances shall be imposed on such Lender or its
Lending Office or the interbank Eurodollar market;

and as a result thereof there shall be any cost to such Lender of agreeing to
make or maintain the Advances (except to the extent already included in the
determination of the Applicable Eurodollar Rate for the Advances), or there
shall be a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender or its
Lending Office, then Borrower shall from time to time, upon written notice and
demand by Agent, pay to Agent for the account of such Lender, within five (5)
Business Days after the date specified in such notice and demand, additional
amounts sufficient to indemnify such Lender against such increased cost. A
certificate as to the amount of such increased cost and setting forth in
reasonable detail the reason for the adjustment and the calculation thereof,
submitted to Borrower and Agent by such Lender, shall, except for patent error,
be final, conclusive, and binding for all purposes. In the event that a Lender
becomes aware of the imposition of a cost to such Lender or a reduction in the
amount to be received or receivable by such Lender or its Lending Office which
is an additional cost pursuant to this

                                       19
<PAGE>

Section 2.13, such Lender shall notify Agent and Borrower in writing of such
imposition or reduction. With respect to costs or reductions incurred by a
Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 relating to any period in which the
Commitment is in effect, the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Promissory Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

      (b) If the Lenders shall notify Borrower in writing that at any time,
because of the circumstances described in clause (x) or (y) in Section 2.13(a)
or any other circumstances arising after the Closing Date and relating to any
period in which the Commitment is in effect affecting the Lenders or the
interbank Eurodollar market or the Lenders' position in such market, the
Applicable Eurodollar Rate, as determined by Agent, will not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding Advances subject to such rate,
then thereafter:

            (i) any Advance made hereunder shall bear interest at the Applicable
Base Rate; and

            (ii) if the affected Advance is then outstanding, Borrower shall
immediately, or if permitted by applicable law, no later than the date permitted
thereby, upon at least one (1) Business Day's written notice to the Lenders,
convert each such Advance into an Advance bearing interest at the Applicable
Base Rate, provided that in such event, Borrower shall not be liable for any
costs referred to in Section 2.15(ii) hereof resulting solely by reason of such
conversion occurring prior to the last day of a Eurodollar Rate Interest Period.

SECTION 2.14. CHANGE OF LENDING. Each Lender agrees that it will use reasonable
efforts to designate an alternate Lending Office with respect to its Advances
affected by the matters or circumstances described in Sections 2.11, 2.12 or
2.13 to reduce the liability of Borrower or avoid the results provided
thereunder, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as
determined by such Lender in its sole discretion.

SECTION 2.15. FUNDING LOSSES. Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon such
Lender's written request to Agent and Agent's delivery thereof to Borrower
(which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts and which
request shall, absent patent error, be final, conclusive, and binding upon
Borrower for all purposes), for all losses, expenses, and liabilities
(including, without limitation, any interest paid by such Lender to lenders of
funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Advances to the extent not recovered
by such Lender in connection with the re-employment of such funds), which such
Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender)
an Advance does not occur on the date specified therefor in a Notice of
Borrowing (whether or not withdrawn); (ii) if any repayment of any Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of a Eurodollar Rate Interest Period
applicable to such Advance; or (iii) if, for any reason, Borrower defaults in
its obligation to repay any Advances when required by the terms of this
Agreement. With respect to losses, expenses and liabilities which a Lender may
sustain as described in this Section 2.15 relating to any period in which the
Commitment is in effect, the provisions of this Section 2.15 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Promissory Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 2.16. TAXES. All payments made by Borrower under this Agreement and the
Promissory Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for or

                                       20
<PAGE>

on account of, any present or future income, stamp, or other taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, reserves or withholdings, now or
hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental
Authority, excluding in the case of each Lender, net income taxes and franchise
taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on such Lender as a result
of a present or former connection between the jurisdiction of the government or
taxing authority imposing such tax and such Lender (excluding a connection
arising solely from such Lender having executed, delivered, or performed its
obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or the
Promissory Notes) or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions and withholdings being hereinafter called "TAXES"). If any Taxes are
required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Lender hereunder or
under the Promissory Notes, the amounts so payable to such Lender shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Lender (after payment of all
Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in
the amounts specified in this Agreement and the appropriate Promissory Note.
Whenever any Taxes are payable by Borrower pursuant to applicable law, as
promptly as possible thereafter Borrower shall send to Agent a certified copy of
an original official receipt received by Borrower showing payment thereof. If
any Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority
or fails to remit to Agent the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Agent and each
Lender for any incremental taxes, interest, or penalties that may become payable
by Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. With respect to any
obligations of Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.16 relating to any period in
which the Commitment is in effect, the agreements in this Section 2.16, as they
apply to any Advance, shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
payment of the Promissory Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 2.17. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

      (a) Borrower shall give Agent written notice (a "NOTICE OF ISSUANCE") in
the event that it desires to have any Letters of Credit (each, a "LETTER OF
CREDIT") issued hereunder no later than 1:00 p.m. Chicago time at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the date of such issuance. Each such notice shall
specify (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Letters of Credit, (ii) the
individual amount of each requested Letter of Credit and the number of Letters
of Credit to be issued, (iii) the date of such issuance (which shall be a
Business Day), (iv) the name and address of the beneficiary, (v) the expiration
date(s) of the Letter(s) of Credit (which in no event shall be later than the
Maturity Date), (vi) the purpose and circumstances for which each such Letter of
Credit is being issued, and (vii) the terms upon which each such Letter of
Credit may be drawn down (which terms shall not leave any discretion to Agent).
No later than 1:00 p.m. Chicago time on the date that is three (3) Business Days
prior to the date of issuance, Borrower shall also specify a precise description
of the documents and the verbatim text of any certificate to be presented by the
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, which if presented by such beneficiary
prior to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit would require Agent, on
behalf of the Lenders, to make a payment under the Letter of Credit; provided
that Agent may, in its reasonable judgment, require changes in any such
documents and certificates in conformity with changes in customary and
commercially reasonable practice or law and provided further, that no Letter of
Credit shall require payment against a conforming draft to be made thereunder on
the following Business Day that such draft is presented if such presentation is
made later than 10:00 a.m

Chicago time (except that if the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit requests at
the time of the issuance of its Letter of Credit that payment be made on the
same Business Day against a conforming draft, such beneficiary shall be entitled
to such a same day draw, provided such draft is presented to Lender no later
than 10:00 a.m. Chicago time and provided further that, prior to the issuance of
such Letter of Credit, Borrower shall have requested to Agent that such
beneficiary shall be entitled to a same day draw). In determining whether to pay
on such Letter of Credit, Agent shall be responsible only to determine that the
documents and certificates required to be delivered under the Letter of Credit
have been delivered and that they comply on their faces with the requirements of
the applicable Letter of Credit.

      (b) Subject to the terms contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, upon receipt of a Notice of Issuance in accordance with Section
2.17(a) requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, Agent, on behalf of the
Lenders, shall issue a Letter of Credit or Letters of Credit, subject to the
requirements of this Section 2.17, in such form as is customarily used by Agent,
in an amount or amounts equal to the amount or amounts requested by Borrower.

      (c) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued in the minimum amount of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).

      (d) There shall be no more than five (5) Letters of Credit outstanding at
any one time, and the aggregate Letter of Credit Usage at any time shall not
exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the then available Commitment; provided,
however, in no event shall any requested Letter of Credit cause the aggregate
principal amount of all Aggregate Advances to exceed the Borrowing Base Loan
Amount.

      (e) In the event of any request for a drawing under any Letter of Credit
by the beneficiary thereunder, Agent shall notify Borrower and Lenders on or
before the date on which Agent intends to honor such drawing. On the date
specified for the drawing, each Lender shall make available to Agent such
Lender's Percentage of the amount of the applicable drawing. Except as provided
in this Section 2.17(e), Borrower shall reimburse Agent, on behalf of the
Lenders, in immediately available funds, on the same day on which such drawing
is honored in of the amount of such drawing. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, unless (i) Borrower shall have notified Agent prior
to 11:00 a.m. Chicago time on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of
such drawing that Borrower intends to reimburse the Lenders for the amount of
such drawing with funds other than an Advance, or (ii) the Advance in amount of
such drawing would cause the aggregate principal amount of all Aggregate
Advances to exceed the Borrowing Base Loan Amount, Borrower shall be deemed to
have timely given notice to Agent of a Base Rate Election pursuant to Section
2.3 on the date on which such drawing is honored in an amount equal to the
amount of such drawing. In the event Borrower reimburses Agent for the amount of
any such drawing, Agent shall thereafter cause to be distributed to the Lenders,
on the Business Day when paid, in like funds, their Percentage of the payments
so received. In the event Agent fails to cause such funds to be distributed to
any Lender within one (1) Business Day after the Business Day when paid to
Agent, Agent shall pay interest to such Lender on such amounts at the Federal
Funds Rate.

      (f) If, after the date hereof, any change in any law or regulation or in
the interpretation thereof by any court or administrative or Governmental
Authority charged with the

                                       22
<PAGE>

administration thereof shall either (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against letters of credit issued
by or assets or deposits held by Lenders or (ii) impose on the Agent or the
Lenders any other condition regarding this Agreement or such Lender as it
pertains to the Letters of Credit and the result of any event referred to in
either clause (i) or (ii) shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of
issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit, then Borrower shall pay to Agent,
on behalf of the Lenders, within five (5) days after written demand by Agent,
which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate showing, in reasonable
detail, the calculation of such amount or amounts, such additional amounts as
shall be required to compensate the Agent or the Lenders for such increased
costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder together with
interest thereon at the Base Rate. The amount specified in the written demand
shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon Borrower.

      (g) Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save Agent and
each Lender harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and disbursements) which Lenders may incur or be subject to as a result of
(i) the issuance of the Letters of Credit, other than as a result of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or such Lender or (ii) the failure of
the Agent or the Lenders to honor a drawing under the Letter of Credit as a
result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or
future Governmental Authority (collectively, "GOVERNMENTAL ACTS"), other than as
a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or the Lenders.
As between Borrower, Agent and the Lenders, Borrower assumes all risks of the
acts and omissions of, or misuses of, the Letters of Credit, by the
beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, neither Agent nor the Lenders shall not be responsible (i) for
the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and
issuance of such Letters of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any
and all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii)
for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary
of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order
to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions or
delays in transmission or delivery of any message, by mail, cable, telegraph,
telex, facsimile transmission, or otherwise; (v) for errors in interpretation of
any technical terms; (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise
of any documents required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of
Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) for the misapplication by the
beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit or the proceeds of such Letter of
Credit; and (viii) for any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of
Agent or the Lenders, including any Governmental Acts, in each case other than
as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or the
Lenders. None of the above shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of
Agent's or the Lenders' rights and powers hereunder. In furtherance and
extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set
forth, any action taken or omitted by Agent or the Lenders under or in
connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or the related certificates,
if taken or omitted in good faith and in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct, shall not put Agent or the Lenders under any resulting
liability to Borrower.

      (h) Borrower may at any time return any undrawn Letter of Credit to Agent
in whole, but not in part.

SECTION 2.18. LETTER OF CREDIT USAGE ABSOLUTE. The obligations of Borrower under
this Agreement in respect of any Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and
irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time) and any Letter of
Credit Documents (as hereinafter defined) under all circumstances, including,
without limitation, to the extent permitted by law, the following circumstances:

      (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any
other agreement or instrument relating thereto (collectively, the "LETTER OF

term of, all or any of the obligations of Borrower in respect of the Letters of

Document, provided that Agent shall not consent to any such change or amendment
unless previously consented to in writing by the Borrower;

      (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any
release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for
all or any of the obligations of Borrower in respect of the Letters of Credit;

      (d) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that
Borrower may have at the time against any beneficiary or any transferee of a
Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such
transferee may be acting), Agent (other than a defense based on the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Agent), the Lenders (other than a defense
based on the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lenders), or any
other Person, whether in connection with the Loan Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby, the Letter of Credit Documents, or any unrelated
transaction;

      (e) any draft or any other document presented under or in connection with
any Letter of Credit or other Loan Document proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect; provided that payment by Agent under such Letter of
Credit against presentation of such draft or document shall not have constituted
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or the Lenders;

      (f) payment by Agent against presentation of a draft or certificate that
does not comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit; provided that such
payment shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Agent or the Lenders; and

      (g) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever other than the payment
in full of all obligations hereunder in respect of any Letter of Credit or any
agreement or instrument relating to any Letter of Credit, whether or not similar

shall not have been the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Agent or the Lenders.

in a separate agreement between Agent and Borrower (the "COMMITMENT FEE").

      (b) Non-refundable fees ("UNUSED FACILITY FEE") in an amount equal to a

then applicable Eurodollar Spread on the daily average of the amount available
to be drawn under the issued and outstanding Letters of Credit, which fee shall
be payable, in arrears, quarterly on the first day of each calendar quarter
during the term of this Agreement. The Letter of Credit Fee shall be calculated

increase its commitment, Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
locate additional lenders willing to hold commitments for the requested
increase. In the event that Lenders commit to any such increase, (i) the
Commitment shall be increased by the amount committed to by the Lenders and any
new lenders; (ii) the applicable Percentage of each of the Lenders shall be
adjusted accordingly, (iii) if requested by any Lender making an additional or

desirable to reflect the aggregate amount, if any, by which the Lenders have
agreed to increase the Commitment or any other lenders have agreed to make new
commitments pursuant to this Section 2.20; in each case notwithstanding anything
in Section 7.15 to the contrary, without the consent of any Lender not adversely
affected by any such supplement, amendment or restatement other than those

Commitment permitted pursuant to this Section 2.20). The fees payable by
Borrower upon any such increase in the Commitment shall be agreed upon by Agent
and Borrower at the time and as a condition of such increase. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2.20 shall constitute or be deemed to
constitute an agreement by any Lender to increase its Commitment hereunder.

SECTION 4.16. INSURANCE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the Mortgages and subject to Section 4.16(b), Borrower maintains upon or in
connection with each of its Properties:

      (a) Property and casualty insurance coverage evidenced by original or
certified copies of insurance policies or binders for such insurance, together
with evidence that the premiums for such policies have been paid current. Such
insurance policies shall insure each of the Mortgaged Properties for 100% of
their full replacement cost in so-called "all risk" form and with coverage for
floods, terrorism, earthquakes (except as provided in Section 4.16(b)) and such
other hazards (including "collapse" and "explosion" and mold related damage) as
Agent may require for each of the Mortgaged Properties and as are consistent
with reasonable and customary requirements in the industry. Such insurance
policies shall contain replacement cost and agreed amount endorsements (with no
reduction for depreciation), an endorsement providing Building Ordinance
Coverage and an endorsement covering the costs of demolition and increased costs
of construction due to the enforcement of building codes or ordinances. To the
extent there exists a boiler on the premises of any of the Mortgaged Properties,
Borrower shall also furnish insurance providing boiler and machinery
comprehensive coverage for all mechanical and electrical equipment at each of
such Mortgaged Properties insuring against breakdown or explosion of such
equipment on a replacement cost value basis. Borrower shall also furnish
business interruption or loss of rental income insurance in connection with all
policies covering property and boiler and machinery insurance for a period of
not less than one (1) year endorsed, other than with respect to boiler and
machinery insurance, to provide a 180 day extended period of indemnity. All
insurance required under this Section 4.16(a) shall (i) be with companies and in
amounts and with coverage and deductibles satisfactory to Agent and (ii) include
endorsements

                                       36
<PAGE>

naming the Lenders as loss payees and shall have endorsed thereon the standard
mortgagee clause in favor of the Lenders.

      (b) The earthquake insurance provided for in Section 4.16(a) but only for
the Mortgaged Properties and only to the extent (i) any Mortgaged Property is
located in an earthquake prone area and (ii) such insurance is available at
commercially reasonable rates.

      (c) Liability and worker's compensation insurance evidenced by original or
certified copies of insurance policies, binders for such insurance policies, or
certificates of insurance, together with evidence that the premiums for such
policies have been paid current. Such insurance shall provide for (i) commercial
general liability (including contractual liability) covering each of the
Mortgaged Properties and Borrower's operations thereon in an amount not less
than $2,000,000 per occurrence and not less than $5,000,000 in the aggregate;
(ii) commercial automobile liability with a limit not less than $1,000,000
combined single limit and endorsed to cover owned, hired and non-owned
automobiles; and (iii) worker's compensation insurance covering all of
Borrower's employees and contracted parties (including their employees) situated
at the Mortgaged Properties in accordance with the statutory requirements of the
states where the applicable Mortgaged Property is located and including an
endorsement for employer's liability coverage. Borrower shall also furnish
umbrella liability coverage in excess of the foregoing liability coverage with a
limit of not less than $25,000,000. The commercial general liability and
automobile policies and umbrella liability policy shall name the Lenders as
additional insureds. Such policies shall also contain a so-called
"products-completed operations endorsement" and mold related liability coverage.

      (d) All companies issuing policies required under this Section 4.16 shall
have a current Best Insurance Reports rating no less favorable than "A", and all
such companies shall be licensed to do business in the states where the
applicable Mortgaged Property is located. All policies required under this
Section 4.16 shall provide that (i) the insurance evidenced thereby shall not be
canceled or modified without at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice
from the insurance carrier to Agent; and (ii) no act or thing done by Borrower
or any Affiliate thereof shall invalidate the policy as against the Lenders.
Borrower shall deliver renewal certificates of all policies of insurance
required under this certificate, together with written evidence that the
premiums are paid current, at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of
the then current policy.

SECTION 4.17. MORTGAGED PROPERTIES.

      (a) Borrower has good and marketable title to all of its assets and
properties, and each Executing Subsidiary shall have good and marketable title
to the applicable Mortgaged Property, subject to no mortgage, security interest,
pledge, lien, charge, encumbrance or title retention or other security agreement
or arrangement of any nature whatsoever, except Permitted Encumbrances. Borrower
and the applicable Executing Subsidiary will forever warrant and defend the
title of the Mortgaged Properties against the lawful claims and demands of all
persons whomsoever (subject to the Permitted Encumbrances) for such Mortgaged
Properties.

      (b) There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of Borrower, threatened
proceedings or actions to revoke, attack, invalidate, rescind, or modify in any
material respect

                                       37
<PAGE>

(i) the zoning of any Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, or (ii) any
building or other permits heretofore issued with respect to any Mortgaged
Property or any part thereof, or asserting that any such zoning or permits do
not permit the operation of any Mortgaged Property or any part thereof or that
any improvements located on such Mortgaged Property cannot be operated in
accordance with its intended use or is in violation of applicable Use
Requirements.

      (c) The Mortgage covering each such Mortgaged Property creates a valid and
enforceable first Lien on such property described therein, as security for the
repayment of the Indebtedness incurred by Borrower hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents, subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances applicable to such
Mortgaged Property.

      (d) The Collateral Pool is now, and so long as the Commitment remains in
effect or any monetary obligation to Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the
Promissory Notes or the other Loan Documents shall remain unpaid, will be owned
solely by Borrower or the applicable Executing Subsidiary, and said Collateral
Pool, including the proceeds resulting from the sale or other disposition
thereof, is and will remain free and clear of any Liens except the Permitted
Encumbrances and the other Liens granted pursuant to the Loan Documents to Agent
and the Lenders, which Liens to Agent and the Lenders shall, at all times, be
first and prior on the Collateral Pool and all proceeds resulting from the sale
or other disposition thereof, and no further action need be taken to perfect
said Liens.

      (e) Neither the existence of any improvements upon a Mortgaged Property
nor the present use or condition of any Mortgaged Property violate in any
material respect any Use Requirements. With respect to each Mortgaged Property,
neither the zoning nor any other right to carry on the present use of such
Mortgaged Property is to any extent dependent upon or related to any other real
estate. Each Mortgaged Property may be operated in its current fashion and
Borrower has received no written notices from any Governmental Authorities
alleging any violation by any Mortgaged Property of any Requirement of Law,
including but not limited to applicable Use Requirements.

      (f) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower, contemplated or
threatened proceedings relating to any (i) taking by eminent domain or other
condemnation of any portion of any Mortgaged Property, (ii) condemnation or
relocation of any roadways abutting any Mortgaged Property and (iii) denial of
access to any Mortgaged Property from any point of access to such Mortgaged
Property.

      (g) Each Mortgaged Property has adequate and permanent legal access to
water, gas, and electrical supply, storm, and sanitary sewerage facilities,
other required public utilities (with respect to each of the aforementioned
items by means of either a direct connection to the source of such utilities or
through connections available on publicly dedicated roadways directly abutting
such Mortgaged Property), parking, and means of access between such Mortgaged
Property and public highways over recognized curb cuts; and all of the foregoing
comply with all applicable Use Requirements.

      (h) Each Mortgaged Property is taxed separately without regard to any
other real estate and constitutes a legally subdivided lot under all applicable
Use Requirements (or, if not subdivided, no subdivision or platting of such
Mortgaged Property is required under applicable

                                       38
<PAGE>

Requirements of Law), and for all purposes each Mortgaged Property may be
mortgaged, conveyed, and otherwise dealt with as an independent parcel.

SECTION 4.18. FULL AND ACCURATE DISCLOSURE. No statement of fact made by or on
behalf of Borrower in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, or
any certificate or financial statement furnished by Borrower to Agent contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make statements contained herein or therein not misleading.

and liabilities (including without limitation contingent liabilities and other
commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into

Notes and hereunder shall not cause the Loan to be usurious or illegal under
applicable law.

SECTION 4.33. LEASES. Except as shown on the rent roll of a particular Mortgaged
Property, there are no Leases covering any portion of such Mortgaged Property.
The Executing Subsidiaries are not in default under any Lease, and to the
Borrower's knowledge after due inquiry, none of the tenants under the Leases are
in default of their respective Leases. Neither Borrower nor any Executing
Subsidiary has executed any prior assignment of the Leases, nor has either of
them performed any act or executed any other instrument which might prevent
Lenders from operating under or enforcing any of the terms and conditions of the
Mortgages applicable to Lender's security interests in such Leases or which
would limit such operation or enforcement.

SECTION 4.34. COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. The Executing Subsidiaries hold their
interest in the Mortgaged Properties for commercial or investment purposes. The
Executing Subsidiaries shall be a single purpose entity whose sole business is
the ownership, operation and management of the Mortgaged Properties.

SECTION 4.35. EXEMPT TRANSACTION. The Loan is an exempt transaction under the
Truth-in-Lending Act(15 U.S.C.A. Sections 1601, et seq.).

SECTION 4.36. REPORTABLE TRANSACTION. The Borrower does not intend to treat the
Advances and related transactions as being a "reportable transaction" (within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). In the event Borrower
determines to take any action inconsistent with such intention, it will promptly
notify the Agent thereof.

      (c) Negative Covenants. Borrower shall fail to observe any of the
covenants specified in Section 5.3(a) through (p).

covenant described in clause (ii) above cannot be cured within thirty (30) days
after notice thereof and Borrower has during such 30-day period commenced to
cure such breach and thereafter diligently pursues all necessary efforts to

breach either cannot be remedied, or remains unremedied, for sixty (60) days
after the occurrence thereof.

      (e) Representations. Any representation, warranty, or statement made or
deemed to be made by Borrower or any of their officers under or in connection

contesting such judgment in good faith).

      (i) Material Adverse Change. Any Material Adverse Change shall occur.

claims against Borrower: (i) declare the Commitment terminated, whereupon the

owing hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, to be, whereupon the same
shall become, forthwith due and payable without presentment, demand, protest, or
other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by Borrower; (ii)
foreclose on any portion of the Collateral Pool concurrently or in such order as
Agent may from time to time see fit; or (iv) take any action permitted under any

                                       52
<PAGE>

SECTION 6.3. MARSHALING; WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS; RECAPTURE. Neither Agent nor
the Lenders shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of
Borrower or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the
obligations of such parties. To the extent permitted by law, Borrower waives and
renounces the benefit of all valuation, appraisement, homestead, exemption,
stay, redemption, and moratorium rights under or by virtue of the constitution
and laws of the state in which the Mortgaged Properties are located and of any
other state or of the United States, now existing or hereafter enacted. To the
extent Agent or any Lender receives any payment by or on behalf of Borrower,
which payment or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to Borrower or
its estate, trustee, receiver, custodian, or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law, or equitable cause, then to
the extent of such payment or repayment, the obligation or part thereof which
has been paid, reduced, or satisfied by the amount so repaid shall be reinstated
by the amount so repaid and shall be included within the liabilities of Borrower
to such party as of the date such initial payment, reduction, or satisfaction
occurred, together with interest at the Default Rate. Borrower agrees that (i)
Agent on behalf of the Lenders shall have the right to pursue all of its rights
and remedies in one proceeding, or separately and independently in separate
proceedings from time to time, as Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion,
shall determine from time to time, (ii) the Collateral Pool may be sold at such
proceeding or proceedings in one or more sales and in such portions or
combinations as Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine,
(iii) Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, shall not be required to marshal assets,
sell any portion of the Collateral Pool in any inverse order of alienation, or
be subject to any "one action" or "election of remedies" law or rule, (iv) the
exercise by the Lenders of any remedies against any one item of the Collateral
Pool will not impede the Lenders from subsequently or simultaneously exercising
remedies against any other item of the Collateral Pool, and (v) all Liens and
other rights, remedies, or privileges provided to Agent and the Lenders under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and
effect until Agent and the Lenders have exhausted all of their remedies against
the Collateral Pool and all of the Collateral Pool has been foreclosed, sold or
otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of the Promissory Notes and the other
obligations of Borrower to Agent and the Lenders. Each Lender and its officers,
directors, shareholders, employees, counsel and agents shall not incur any
liability as a result of the sale of the Collateral Pool, or any part thereof,
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Document, or for
the failure to sell or offer for sale the Collateral Pool, or any part thereof,
for any reason whatsoever. Borrower waives any claims against each Lender and
its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, counsel and agents arising
with respect to the price at which the Collateral Pool, or any part thereof, may
have been sold by reason of the fact that such price was less than the aggregate
amount of the indebtedness due under the Promissory Notes, this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 6.4. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS.

      (a) All proceeds received by Agent or the Lenders in respect of the
repayment of any sums due hereunder or in connection with a foreclosure sale of
all or any portion of the Collateral Pool after the occurrence of an Event of
Default shall be applied: first, to the costs of enforcement of the Lenders'
rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; second, to any unpaid fees
payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in such order of
priority as Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine but
subject to the rights of

                                       53
<PAGE>

the Lenders; third, to any accrued and unpaid interest (including all interest
owing at the Default Rate) on Advances made hereunder; fourth, to the principal
amount of the Advances; and fifth, if any excess proceeds exist, to Borrower or
any party entitled thereto as a matter of law.

      (b) Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deposit any
proceeds in its possession which are available under clause (v) of Section
6.4(a) above into a court of competent jurisdiction for determination by such
court of the disposition of such excess proceeds and upon such deposit, Agent
shall have no further liability with respect to such proceeds. All costs and
expenses of Agent in connection with such action may be deducted or charged by
Agent against such excess proceeds and shall otherwise be reimbursed by Borrower
upon demand. Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to request and
rely on the instructions of Borrower in connection with the disposition of any
such excess proceeds and, upon compliance with such instructions, shall have no
further liability with respect to such proceeds.

SECTION 6.5. ATTORNEYS-IN-FACT. Borrower hereby makes, constitutes and appoints
Agent, and its agents and designees, the true and lawful agents and
attorneys-in-fact of Borrower, with full power of substitution, to take any or
all of the following actions during the continuance of an Event of Default: (i)
to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to Borrower relating to the
Collateral Pool, (ii) to notify and direct the United States Post Office
authorities by notice given in the name of Borrower and signed on its behalf, to
change the address for delivery of all mail addressed to Borrower relating to
the Collateral Pool to an address to be designated by Agent, and to cause such
mail to be delivered to such designated address where Agent may open all such
mail and remove therefrom any notes, checks, acceptances, drafts, money orders
or other instruments in payment of the Collateral Pool in which Agent has a
security interest hereunder and any documents relative thereto, with full power
to endorse the name of Borrower upon any such notes, checks, acceptances,
drafts, money orders or other form of payment or on the Collateral Pool or
security of any kind and to effect the deposit and collection thereof, and Agent
shall have the further right and power to endorse the name of Borrower on any
documents otherwise relating to such Collateral Pool, and (iii) to do any and
all other things necessary or proper to carry out the intent of this Agreement
and to perfect and protect the Liens and rights of Agent created under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, to claim, bring suit, settle or adjust
any insurance proceeds claims relating to the Collateral Pool. Borrower agrees
that neither the Lenders nor any of their officers, directors, shareholders,
employees, counsel, agents, designees or attorneys-in-fact will be liable for
any acts of commission or omission, or for any error of judgment or mistake of
fact or law, except for any acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
powers granted hereunder are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable
during the term hereof.

SECTION 6.6. ACTIONS IN RESPECT OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.

      (a) If, at any time and from time to time, any Letter of Credit shall have
been issued hereunder and an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, then, upon the occurrence and during the continuation thereof, Agent
may, whether in addition to the taking by Agent of any of the actions described
in this Article 6 or otherwise, make a demand upon Borrower to, and forthwith
upon such demand (but in any event within ten (10) days after such demand),
Borrower shall, pay to Agent, in same day funds, an amount equal to the amount
of the Letter of Credit Usage under the Letters of Credit, for deposit in a
special cash collateral account

                                       54
<PAGE>

(the "LETTER OF CREDIT COLLATERAL ACCOUNT") to be maintained in the name of
Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, under Agent's sole dominion and control,
and at such place as shall be designated by the Agent.

      (b) Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and grants to Agent, for its benefit
and the benefit of the Lenders, a lien on and a security interest in, the
following collateral (the "LETTER OF CREDIT COLLATERAL"):

            (i) the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, all cash deposited
therein and all certificates and instruments, if any, from time to time
representing or evidencing the Letter of Credit Collateral Account;

            (ii) all notes, certificates of deposit and other instruments from
time to time hereafter delivered to or otherwise possessed by Agent or the
Lenders for or on behalf of Borrower in substitution for or in respect of any or
all of the then existing Letter of Credit Collateral;

            (iii) all interest, dividends, cash, instruments and other property
from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or
in exchange for any or all of the then existing Letter of Credit Collateral; and

            (iv) to the extent not covered by the above clauses, all proceeds of
any or all of the foregoing Letter of Credit Collateral.

      The lien and security interest granted hereby secures the payment of all
obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

      (c) Borrower hereby authorizes Agent to apply, from time to time after
funds are deposited in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, funds then held
in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account to the payment of any amounts, in
such order as Agent may elect, as shall have become due and payable by Borrower
to Agent in respect of the Letters of Credit.

      (d) Neither Borrower nor any Person claiming or acting on behalf of or
through the Borrower shall have any right to withdraw any of the funds held in
the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, except as provided in Section 6.6(h)
hereof.

      (e) Borrower agrees that it will not (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any
interest in the Letter of Credit Collateral or (ii) create or permit to exist
any lien, security interest or other charge or encumbrance upon or with respect
to any of the Letter of Credit Collateral, except for the security interest
created by this Section 6.6.

      (f) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

            (i) Agent may, in its sole discretion, without notice to Borrower
except as required by law and at any time from time to time, charge, set off or
otherwise apply all or any part of first, (x) amounts previously drawn on any
Letter of Credit that have not previously been reimbursed by the Borrower and
(y) any Letter of Credit Usage described in clause (ii) of the definition
thereof that are then due and payable and second, any other unpaid Advances then
due

                                       55
<PAGE>

and payable against the Letter of Credit Collateral Account or any part thereof,
in such order as the Lender shall elect.

            (ii) Agent may also exercise, in its sole discretion, in respect of
the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, in addition to the other rights and
remedies provided herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and
remedies of a secured party upon default under the UCC in effect at that time.

      (g) Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody
and preservation of the Letter of Credit Collateral if the Letter of Credit
Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which Agent accords
its own property, it being understood that, assuming such treatment, Agent shall
not have any responsibility or liability with respect thereto.

      (h) At such time as all Events of Default have been cured or waived in
writing, all amounts remaining in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account shall
be promptly returned to the Borrower. Absent such cure or written waiver, any
surplus of the funds held in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and
remaining after payment in full of all of the outstanding Advances and Letters
of Credit hereunder and under any other Loan Document after the Maturity Date
shall be paid to Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive
such surplus.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                            AGENCY AND INTERCREDITOR

SECTION 7.1. APPOINTMENT. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints
LaSalle Bank National Association, as Agent of such Lender under the Loan
Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes LaSalle Bank National
Association, to act as Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents and to exercise
such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to Agent by the
terms of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, together with such other powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
Loan Documents, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on
the part of Agent shall be read into any of the Loan Documents or otherwise
exist against Agent. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit
of Agent and the Lenders, and Borrower shall not have any rights as a third
party beneficiary or otherwise under any of the provisions of this Article VII.
In performing its functions and duties under the Loan Documents, Agent shall act
solely as Agent or the Lenders and does not assume nor shall Agent be deemed to
have assumed any obligation or relationship of trust or agency with or for
Borrower or any of such party's respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 7.2. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. Agent may execute any of its duties under the
Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled
to advice of counsel (including its internal counsel) concerning all matters
pertaining to such duties. Agent shall not

                                       56
<PAGE>

be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

SECTION 7.3. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Agent shall not be (a) liable for any
action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or any Person described in
Section 7.2 under or in connection with any Loan Document (except for those
actions arising from Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (b)
responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties made by Borrower contained in any Loan Document,
or by Borrower in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred
to or provided for in, or received under or in connection with any Loan Document
or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of any Loan Document or any such certificate, report, statement or
other document, or for any failure of Borrower, or any Lender to perform or
observe its respective obligations hereunder or thereunder. Unless Agent shall
have been requested in writing to do so by a Lender on such Lender's behalf,
Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire
as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of any Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, or the books or
records of Borrower. This Section 7.3 is intended to govern solely the
relationship between Agent, on the one hand, and the Lenders, on the other.

SECTION 7.4. RELIANCE BY AGENT. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation (including by
telephone) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel (including, without limitation, its internal counsel and counsel
to Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent. Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any
Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Lenders required pursuant to this Agreement or it shall first be indemnified to
its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

SECTION 7.5. NOTICE OF DEFAULT AND OTHER NOTICES FROM BORROWER.

      (a) Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless (i) Agent has received
written notice from a Lender or Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing
such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default," or (ii) Agent, in its capacity as a Lender, has actual knowledge of
such Default or Event of Default. In the event that Agent receives such a
notice, Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. Agent shall
take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
directed by the Required Lenders; provided that unless and until Agent shall
have received such directions, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take
such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as Agent shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the
Lenders.

      (b) Each Lender agrees that it shall promptly notify Agent in writing
after it first has knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or of any matter
which in such Lender's judgment

                                       57
<PAGE>

adversely affects any Lender's respective interests in the Commitment, which
notice will describe the Default or Event of Default or matter in reasonable
detail. Agent shall give a copy of any such notice received by Agent to the
other Lenders if such notice pertains to a Decision by the Lenders pursuant to
Sections 7.14 or 7.15 hereof.

      (c) Agent shall distribute to the Lenders copies of material notices and
information furnished by the Borrower to Agent in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, which may be distributed by posting on Intralinks or other
customary distribution methods.

SECTION 7.6. NON-RELIANCE ON AGENT AND THE OTHER LENDERS. Each Lender expressly
acknowledges that neither Agent, nor any of its officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates, has made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by Agent hereafter taken, including, without
limitation, any review of the affairs of Borrower shall be deemed to constitute
any representation or warranty by Agent. Each Lender represents and warrants to
Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
(a) made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations,
property, prospects, financial and other condition, creditworthiness and
solvency of Borrower, (b) satisfied itself as to the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency and value of all of the Loan
Documents and all other instruments and documents furnished pursuant to any Loan
Document, and (c) made its own decision as to its Percentage of the Commitment
pursuant to this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analyses, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it
deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property,
prospects, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrower.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required pursuant to
the Loan Documents to be furnished by Agent to the Lenders, Agent shall not have
any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, prospects, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of Borrower which may come into the
possession of Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

SECTION 7.7. INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to indemnify Agent (in its
capacity as such) and its officers, directors, employees, representatives and
agents (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower and without limiting the
obligation, if any, of Borrower to do so), ratably in accordance with their
Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the fees and
disbursements of counsel for Agent or such Person in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened,
whether or not Agent or such Person shall be designated a party thereto) that
may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent or such
Person as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way related to or by reason
of, any of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or the execution,
delivery or performance of any Loan Document (but excluding any such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Agent or such Person as determined by a court of competent

                                       58
<PAGE>

jurisdiction). The agreements in this subsection shall survive the payment of
the Promissory Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 7.8. AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. LaSalle Bank National Association
and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage
in any kind of business with Borrower as though it were not Agent hereunder.
With respect to Advances made or renewed by it and any Promissory Note issued to
it, Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Agent.

SECTION 7.9. AGENT'S RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL. Agent may resign at any time by
giving notice thereof to the Lenders and Borrower. In addition, the Agent may be
removed at any time with good cause by written notice received by the Agent from
the Required Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the
Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders
shall designate in writing another Person as the successor Agent. If such
proposed successor Agent agrees in writing to act as Agent in accordance with
the terms hereof, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, duties and obligations of the
resigning or removed Agent, and the resigning or removed Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations as Agent under this Agreement. After
any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this
Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.10. APPOINTMENT OF A SUBSTITUTE AGENT. Subject to the provisions of
Section 7.9 above, LaSalle Bank National Association shall be Agent under this
Agreement and the Loan Documents until the Loan Documents have been terminated
and the Lenders have been paid in full. In the event that LaSalle Bank National
Association has a conflict which requires that it not act as Agent in connection
with certain matters as to which LaSalle Bank National Association deems a
conflict of interest exists, LaSalle Bank National Association may, at its
option and upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Borrower and the
Lenders, request a substitute Agent be selected in accordance with the terms of
this Section to act as Agent with respect to such matters. LaSalle Bank National
Association shall request a substitute Agent in accordance with the terms of
this Section in the event that LaSalle Bank National Association has sold its
entire interest in the Commitment to a Purchasing Lender (as hereafter defined).
Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, the Required Lenders
shall select a proposed substitute agent and shall notify Borrower of the
identity of such proposed substitute agent. After any retiring substitute
Agent's resignation hereunder as substitute Agent, the provisions of this
Section 7.10 and Section 8.4 hereof shall inure to the benefit of such retired
substitute Agent as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was substitute Agent under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.11. LOANS. Each Lender shall make available to Borrower such Lender's
portion of the Commitment subject to and in accordance with the provisions of
the Loan Documents. Borrower shall look solely to each Lender for the
performance of such Lender's obligations, covenants and agreements under the
Loan Documents on the part of each Lender to be performed or observed with
respect to each such portion of the Commitment, subject to and upon the
conditions, limitations and restrictions set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, as evidenced by the signature of each such party hereto. In the event
any Lender has not made

                                       59
<PAGE>

available its Percentage of any Advance or Letter of Credit draw, Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to), and each Lender authorizes Agent to, advance for
such Lender's account, pursuant to the terms hereof, the amount of the Advance
or Letter of Credit draw to be made by such Lender and each Lender agrees to
reimburse Agent in immediately available funds for any amount so advanced on its
behalf. If any such reimbursement is not made in immediately available funds on
the same day on which Agent shall have made such amount available on behalf of
any Lender, such Lender shall also pay interest thereon to Agent at the Federal
Funds Rate. In the event that Agent advances a Lender's Percentage of any
Advance or Letter of Credit draw pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.11 and
such Lender fails to reimburse Agent, Borrower shall repay such amounts to
Agent, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate until so repaid.

SECTION 7.12. PRIORITY OF LOANS. Each Lenders portion of the Commitment shall be
of equal priority with each other Lender's portion of the Commitment, and no
portion of the Commitment shall have priority or preference over any other
portion of the Commitment or the security therefor.

SECTION 7.13. BOOKS AND RECORDS. Agent will keep customary books and records
relating to the Advances, and such books and records shall be available at
Agent's office for the Lenders' reasonable inspection during Agent's normal
business hours.

SECTION 7.14. DECISIONS OF THE LENDERS. (a) Except as expressly set forth in
Sections 7.15 and 7.16 hereof, all decisions, consents, waivers, approvals and
other actions (collectively, "DECISIONS") authorized to be taken under or in
connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by any Lender shall
be taken by Agent in its discretion reasonably exercised, subject to the
provisions of Section 7.4 hereof. Except as expressly provided in Sections 7.15
and 7.16 hereof, Agent (i) may consent or withhold consent to any action by
Borrower, (ii) may exercise or refrain from exercising any power, rights or
remedies hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in respect of
the Advances, and/or (iii) may waive any conditions in any Loan Documents, so
long as such consent, exercise or waiver would not, in Agent's judgment
reasonably exercised, represent a departure from the standards followed by Agent
in the administration of loans held by Agent entirely for its own account. Agent
may request a Decision with respect to matters described in Sections 7.15 and
7.16 hereof at any time by making a request for such Decision in writing to all
of the Lenders. Any such request (x) shall contain an adequate description
together with relevant background information of the Decision being requested,
(y) shall specify the reasons for such request, and (z) shall state the effect
of not responding to such notice as set forth in this Section 7.15. Agent will
provide the Lenders with such additional information as the Lenders may
reasonably request to assist such Lenders in reaching a Decision, to the extent
such information is in Agent's possession or under its control. The requested
Decision shall be deemed approved by the Lenders if and when Agent receives
written approval from the required percentage of the Lenders as specified in
Sections 7.15 and 7.16 hereof, as the case may be. If a Lender does not deliver
to Agent a written objection thereto within ten (10) Business Days after hand
delivery, mailing or delivery to an express courier service of the request by
Agent, such Lender shall be deemed to have approved the requested Decision. If
Agent is unable to contact the usual representatives of a Lender for any reason,
Agent will make a good faith effort to contact other representatives of such
Lender as necessary to reach a Decision within the allotted time. To the extent
that Agent reasonably deems

                                       60
<PAGE>

necessary, any such Decision may also be requested telephonically by Agent from
each Lender with such telephonic request to be confirmed in writing by Agent.
Any Decision as to which Agent has made telephonic requests for approval shall
be deemed approved by the Lenders after Agent has received the written approval
of the required percentage of the Lenders as specified in Sections 7.15 and 7.16
hereof. Borrower shall be promptly notified of the Decision, if such Decision
was made in response to a request by Borrower.

SECTION 7.15. UNANIMOUS APPROVALS BY THE LEADERS. No written amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver which adds, deletes, changes or waives any
provisions of the Loan Documents shall (a), without the prior approval of all
Lenders, (i) extend either the Maturity Date or any installment or required
prepayment of any Advances; (ii) reduce the rate or extend the time of payment
of interest on any Advances; (iii) reduce the principal amount of any Advances;
(iv) reduce the fees payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
or any other fee payable to the Lenders; (v) subject to the terms and conditions
of Section 2.20, change any Lender's portion of the Commitment or the amount of
any Advance of any Lender; or (vi) change any provision of this Section 7.15 or
the definition of Required Lenders; or (b) amend, modify or waive any provision
of any Loan Document, if the effect thereof is to affect the rights or duties of
Agent, without the written consent of the then Agent. Any such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver shall apply to each of the Lenders equally
and shall be binding upon Borrower, the Lenders, Agent and all future holders of
the Promissory Notes. In the case of any waiver, Borrower, the Lenders and Agent
shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the
outstanding Promissory Notes, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall
be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent
thereon.

SECTION 7.16. APPROVALS BY THE REQUIRED LENDERS.

      (a) Upon Agent's receipt of a notice of default (as defined in Section
7.5(a) hereof) with respect to an Event of Default, Agent shall consult with the
Lenders in respect of any such Event of Default to determine a course of action
which is acceptable to the Required Lenders. Subject to Section 7.15 hereof,
Agent shall pursue any such course of action approved by the Required Lenders in
respect of any such Event of Default, including, without limitation,
acceleration of the Advances. In the event that the Required Lenders cannot
decide which remedies, if any, are to be pursued, Agent may commence proceedings
on behalf of the Lenders; provided, however, that if at any time thereafter the
Required Lenders shall direct that a different or additional remedial action
shall be taken, such different or additional remedial action shall be taken in
lieu of or in addition to such proceedings.

      (b) Agent shall not, without the prior approval of the Required Lenders,
(i) enter into written amendments, supplements, modifications or waivers for the
purpose of adding, deleting, changing or waiving any of the provisions of
Article V or Section 6.1, except to the extent such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver requires the unanimous consent of the Lenders pursuant to
Section 7.15 hereof, or (ii) enter into written amendments, supplements,
modifications or waivers for the purpose of adding, deleting, changing or
waiving any provision of the Loan Documents, except to the extent such
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver requires the unanimous consent of
the Lenders (pursuant to Section 7.15 hereof), or

                                       61
<PAGE>

(iii) consent to, approve, or waive the requirement of receipt of, any
documents, certificates or other agreements or statements delivered or to be
delivered by Borrower or any other Person pursuant to Article III hereof or (iv)
consent to or permit (if not expressly permitted under the Loan Documents) the
assignment or transfer by Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under
any Loan Document, consent to any merger or consolidation or sale, lease or
other disposal of all or a substantial part of Borrower's property or assets,
modify any financial covenants, waive any Default or Event of Default, or waive
or release any lien on any of the Mortgaged Properties or commence any judicial
or nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding, in each case without the written consent
of all the Lenders.

      (c) All losses, costs, expenses, disbursements, liabilities, fees
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements), obligations, damages,
suits, actions and penalties of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, a
"LOSS") incurred by Agent in connection with the Advances (except any Loss
resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) shall be borne by the Lenders
in accordance with each Lender's Percentage.

      (d) Each Lender shall, upon demand by Agent, reimburse Agent (to the
extent not otherwise reimbursed by Borrower) for such Lender's Percentage of (i)
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Agent in good faith in connection with
any Event of Default under the Loan Documents (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees and disbursements of outside counsel), and (ii) any other
expenses incurred in good faith to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower in
connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents.

      (e) Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the provisions of Sections 7.14
through 7.16 and any modifications thereof entered into by Agent and the Lenders
of such provisions and specifically acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding any provisions in the Loan Documents requiring action by the
"Lenders" or similar provisions in connection with the declaration of an Event
of Default, the acceleration of the indebtedness evidenced by the Loan Documents
and/or the exercise of any remedies under the Loan Documents, Agent is hereby
empowered to act on behalf of the Lenders in accordance with the provisions
hereof and the authority of Agent with respect to any action taken by Agent
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement shall not be contested by
Borrower by reason of any different or conflicting provision contained in any of
the Loan Documents.

SECTION 7.17. MANAGEMENT OF ACQUIRED COLLATERAL. If, following any Event of
Default, Agent acquires title to one or more Mortgaged Properties by foreclosure
under the Mortgage (or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure), Agent shall hold title
to such Mortgaged Property in its own name, as Agent for the Lenders to the
extent of their Commitments. Each Lender hereby irrevocably waives any right to
seek a partition of any interest in the Mortgaged Property. Agent shall have the
sole and exclusive right to make (or to refrain from making) all decisions with
respect to the leasing, encumbering, use, operation, maintenance, improvement,
repair and restoration of the Mortgaged Property (and any improvements located
thereon); provided, however, that Agent shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Required Lenders (a) sell (or lease as a whole) the Mortgaged
Property or encumber the Mortgaged Property with a mortgage, deed of trust or
similar instrument securing indebtedness for borrowed money, or (b) make any
single expenditure with respect to the Mortgaged Property in an amount in excess
of $200,000

                                       62
<PAGE>

(exclusive of taxes and assessments, insurance premiums, utility charges and
expenditures required to comply with applicable laws), or (c) make any material
repairs, restorations and/or improvements to the Mortgaged Property (except to
the extent required by applicable laws). Subject to the foregoing, each Lender,
pro rata in accordance with its Commitment, shall reimburse Agent on demand for
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Agent in connection with the sale,
lease, encumbering, use, operation, maintenance, improvement, repair and
restoration of the Mortgaged Property (including all costs and charged,
insurance premiums, common area maintenance charges, leasing commissions, tenant
improvement costs, repair costs and restoration costs). The indemnity provisions
contained in Section 7.7 above shall apply equally to actions (and omissions) by
Agent with respect to the Mortgaged Property so acquired by Agent. Each Lender
shall participate pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitment in all
income, expenses, profits and losses of the Mortgaged Property. Without
limitation on the foregoing, Agent shall endeavor to consult with the Lenders
prior to making any material decision regarding the Mortgaged Property.

                                  ARTICLE VIII.

SECTION 8.2. AMENDMENTS, ETC. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this or
the other Loan Documents, nor consent to any departure by either party
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the party or its agent, if authorized to act on its behalf,
against whom enforcement of such waiver or amendment is sought, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specified purpose for which given.

SECTION 8.3. NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay on the part of
the Lenders in exercising any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan
Document and no course of dealing between Borrower and Agent or the Lenders
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy
hereunder. The rights and remedies herein and in the other Loan Documents
expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
that the Lenders would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on Borrower not
required hereunder or under the other Loan Documents in any case shall entitle
Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Lenders to any other
or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

SECTION 8.4. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES, ETC. Borrower shall:

      (a) whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated are consummated,
pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Agent in the
administration (both before and after the execution hereof and including advice
of counsel as to the rights and duties of Agent) of, and in connection with the
preparation, execution, and delivery of, preservation of rights under,
enforcement of, and, after an Event of Default, refinancing, renegotiation, or
restructuring of, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the documents
and instruments referred to therein; any amendment, waiver, or consent relating
thereto (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel for Agent);

      (b) After an Event of Default, pay all reasonably out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of the Lenders (including advice of counsel as to the rights and duties
of the Lenders) in connection with such Event of Default;

      (c) to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay and hold Agent and the
Lenders harmless from and against any and all present and future stamp,
recording, and other similar taxes and fees with respect to the foregoing
matters and save the Lenders harmless from and

                                       64
<PAGE>

against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay or
omission to pay such taxes and fees; and

      (d) indemnify Agent and the Lenders and each of their officers, directors,
employees, Affiliates, representatives, and agents from, and hold each of them
harmless against, any and all costs, losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
expenses incurred by any of them (whether or not any of them is designated a
party thereto) arising out of or by reason of any litigation, or other
proceeding related to any actual or proposed use by Borrower of the proceeds of
any of the Advances or Borrower entering into and performing of this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents or resulting from the ownership of any Mortgaged
Property, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation, or
other proceeding; provided that Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify any
such Person to the extent of any costs, losses, liabilities, claims, damages, or
expenses caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

            If and to the extent that the obligations of Borrower under this
Section 8.4 are unenforceable for any reason, Borrower hereby agrees to make the
maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which
is permissible under applicable law. Borrower's obligations under this Section
8.4 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the payment of the sums
due hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 8.5. RIGHT OF SETOFF. In addition to and not in limitation of all rights
of offset that the Lenders may have under applicable law, the Lenders shall,
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and whether or not the Lenders have
made any demand or Borrower's obligations are matured, have the right to
appropriate and apply to the payment of Borrower's obligations hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents, all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) of Borrower then or thereafter held by, and other
indebtedness or property then or thereafter owing by, the Lenders.

SECTION 8.6. BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and
assigns of the parties hereto, provided that Borrower may not assign or transfer
any of its interest hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

SECTION 8.7. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.

      (a) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the rights and
obligations of the parties thereunder shall be construed in accordance with and
be governed by the law (without giving effect to the conflict of law principles
thereof) of the State of Illinois except as otherwise specifically provided in
the Loan Documents.

      (b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents or any document related thereto may be brought in the
courts of the State of Illinois or of the United States of America for the
Northern District of Illinois, and by execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Borrower hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property generally and
unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Borrower hereby
irrevocably waives any objection, including, without limitation, any objection
to the laying of

                                       65
<PAGE>

venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it may now or
hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such
respective jurisdictions. Borrower agrees that any process in any proceeding in
any such court may be served on Borrower through the United States mails in
accordance with Section 8.1.

      (c) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
PROMISSORY NOTE OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND FROM ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

      (d) Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Lenders to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or
otherwise proceed against Borrower in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 8.8. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each
of which when executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

SECTION 8.9. HEADINGS DESCRIPTIVE. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction
of any provision of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof, and all prior discussions, negotiations, term sheets,
commitment letters, agreements, correspondence and document drafts with respect
to such matters are merged herein and therein. Neither the Lenders nor any
employee of the Lenders has authorized to make any representation or agreement
upon which Borrower or its Affiliates may rely unless such matter is set forth
in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 8.11. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Borrower hereby agrees to, promptly upon the
request of the Lenders, execute and deliver to the Lenders such additional
documents and to provide such additional information as the Lenders may
reasonably require to carry out or confirm the terms of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents.

SECTION 8.12. PARTICIPATION. Any Lender may at any time after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, sell to one or more Persons (each a "PARTICIPANT")
participating interests in any Advance owing to such Lender, any Promissory Note
held by such Lender and/or any other interest of such Lender hereunder (in
respect of any such Lender, its "CREDIT EXPOSURE"). Notwithstanding any such
sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
rights and obligations hereunder shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall
remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain
the holder of any such Promissory Note for all purposes hereunder (except as
expressly provided below), and Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations
hereunder. Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to

                                       66
<PAGE>

the benefits of Sections 2.12. 2.13 and 2.15 hereof. Each Lender agrees that any
agreement between such Lender and any such Participant in respect of such
participating interest shall not restrict such Lender's fight to agree to any
amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to any Loan Document, except where
the result of any of the foregoing would be to extend the final maturity of any
Advance or any regularly scheduled installment thereof or reduce the rate or
extend the time of payment of interest thereon or reduce the principal amount
thereof.

SECTION 8.13. ASSIGNMENTS.

      (a) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and from time to time assign to any Lender or any affiliate
thereof or to any other Person (each a "PURCHASING LENDER") all or any part of
its Credit Exposure, provided that the Credit Exposure acquired by such assignee
shall equal or exceed $10,000,000. Borrower, Agent and the Lenders agree that to
the extent of any assignment, the Purchasing Lender shall be deemed to have the
same rights and benefits under the Loan Documents and the same obligation as it
would have had if it had been a Lender which was one of the original parties
hereto. The consent of Agent and, provided no Default or Event of Default has
occurred, Borrower shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective,
which consents will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;
provided that Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly
with the assignor Lender in connection with the interests so assigned to the
Purchasing Lender unless and until such Purchasing Lender executes a supplement
to this Agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit T attached hereto (a
"FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT"). Borrower acknowledges that the
provisions of this Section 8.13 relate only to absolute assignments of a
Lender's Credit Exposure and that any restrictions thereon do not pertain to or
prohibit assignments creating security interests, including any pledge or
assignment by a Lender of its Credit Exposure or Promissory Notes to a Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with Requirements of Law.

      (b) Upon (i) execution of a Form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement,
(ii) delivery of an executed copy thereof to Borrower and Agent, (iii) payment
by such Purchasing Lender to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the
purchase price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Purchasing Lender,
and (iv) payment to the Agent of an assignment fee in the amount of $3,000.00,
such transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to the
extent of such assignment and such Purchasing Lender shall for all purposes be a
Lender party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of
a Lender under this Agreement to the same extent as if it were an original party
hereto, and no further consent or action by Borrower, the Lenders or Agent shall
be required. Such Form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall be deemed to
amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect
the addition of such Purchasing Lender as a Lender. Promptly after the
consummation of any transfer to a Purchasing Lender pursuant hereto, the
transferor Lender, Agent and Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so
that a replacement Promissory Note is issued to such transferor Lender and a new
Promissory Note is issued to such Purchasing Lender, in each case in principal
amounts reflecting such transfer.

                                       67
<PAGE>

      (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
8.13, the Agent shall always maintain its Commitment in an amount which is equal
to or greater than the respective Commitments of each other Lender.

SECTION 8.14. WITHHOLDING. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
Participant or other assignee of all or any part of the Credit Exposure of any
Lender, other than a Purchasing Lender, shall be entitled to any of the benefits
of Section 2.16 hereof.

SECTION 8.15. AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY THE LENDERS. Each Lender agrees that it shall
act as a trustee for the benefit of the other Lenders to the extent of the
respective interests of the other Lenders in the Advances and/or Letters of
Credit with respect to all sums of any kind paid to or received by such Lender
in payment of all or a portion of the Advances or reimbursement for draws on the
Letters of Credit, as applicable, by or on behalf of Borrower.

SECTION 8.16. NO JOINT VENTURE. Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
selling of an interest in the Advances nor any agreement to share in profits or
losses as provided herein is intended to be, nor shall it be construed to be,
the formation of a partnership or joint venture among the parties to this
Agreement.

SECTION 8.17. ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY PARTIES HERETO. The agreement to and acceptance
of this Agreement by the parties hereto, indicated by the execution of this
Agreement, shall evidence (a) each party's acceptance of all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (b) each party's
consent to Agent's acting as Agent on behalf of the Lenders with regard to all
aspects of the administration, enforcement and collection of the Advances, the
issuance of the Letters of Credit and to all matters pertaining to the Loan
Documents as provided for herein.

SECTION 8.18. RIGHT OF THE LENDERS AND AGENT TO TRANSACT BUSINESS. The Lenders,
Agent and/or any of their respective Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind
of business with, Borrower, its general partners, including General Partner, any
partners of the general partners, or any other Person without any duty to
account therefor to the other Lenders and/or Agent, as the case may be.

SECTION 8.19. SHARING OF PAYMENTS. Each of the Lenders agrees that if it should
receive any amount under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
(whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of
the right of banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement
of any right under the Loan Documents, or otherwise) which is applicable to the
payment of any Advance (or reimbursement for draws on the Letters of Credit) of
a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums received by the other
Lenders is in a greater proportion than the total of such Advance (or
reimbursement for draws on Letters of Credit) then owed and due to such Lender
bears to the total of such Advance (or reimbursement for draws on Letters of
Credit) then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such
receipt, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash
without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in such Advance
(or reimbursement for draws on the Letters of Credit) owing to such Lenders in
such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all of the
Lenders in such amount; provided that if all or any portion of such excess
amount is thereafter recovered from such

                                       68
<PAGE>

Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest.

SECTION 8.20. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Except as set forth in Section 7.11
above, no claim may be made by Borrower or any other Person against Agent or any
Lender or any of their Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or
agent of any of such Persons for any special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other
theory of liability arising out of or under Article VII; and Borrower hereby
waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any such claim for any such damages,
whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its
favor.

SECTION 8.21. RELIANCE BY BORROWER. Borrower shall have the right to rely,
without investigation, upon all notices, approvals or other actions of Agent.
All provisions of this Agreement requiring submission by Borrower of information
or other documentation, or the obtaining of any approvals or consents, shall be
deemed to apply to Agent only and Borrower shall not otherwise be required to
obtain any approvals of any other Lenders. All actions, information, reports,
notices and any and all other action by Agent to Borrower shall be binding upon
all Lenders.

SECTION 8.22. TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

SECTION 8.23. INDEMNITY. Except for an Indemnified Loss which is finally
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted directly and
proximately from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lenders or,
if applicable Agent, Borrower agrees absolutely to protect, defend, indemnify
and hold the Lenders, Agent, their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents and each other Person controlling any of the foregoing (each, an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") harmless from and against any and all harm, loss,
liability, damage, suite, claim, expense, fees and costs (including, without
limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees) (each, an "INDEMNIFIED LOSS")
suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with any claim,
demand, suit or proceeding brought or asserted by any Person against an
Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to the Lenders' and Agent's
entering into or carrying out the terms of this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents or being the holder of a Promissory Note or any of the Loan Documents
or resulting from Borrower's performance hereunder including, without
limitation, any injury or damage to any Person or property occurring on or about
any of the Mortgaged Properties. This Section 8.23 is intended to apply only to
third party claims against the Indemnified Parties, and not the Lenders' claims
against Borrower if an Event of Default has occurred, which shall be limited as
provided in Article XI. This Section 8.23 shall survive the repayment of the
Indebtedness, the cancellation of the Promissory Notes, and the foreclosures or
reconveyance of the Lenders' security interests in any applicable Mortgaged
Properties.

SECTION 8.24. KNOWLEDGE. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrases "to the
knowledge of Borrower" or "to the best knowledge of Borrower" shall mean, after
reasonable inquiry of Property Manager, the knowledge of Thompson, Rick Hutton,
Talle Voorhies and William Daniels.

SECTION 8.25. TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.

<PAGE>

      (a) This Agreement shall supersede the Original Agreement in its entirety,
except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.25. On the Closing Date, the
rights and obligations of the parties under the Original Agreement, the "Notes"
and the "Note Assumptions" and any Letters of Credit (as such terms are defined
therein) shall be subsumed within and be governed by this Agreement, the Notes
and the Note Assumptions and any Letters of Credit; provided however, that any
of the obligations and liabilities of Borrower under the Original Agreement
outstanding under the Original Agreement shall, for purposes of this Agreement,
be obligations and liabilities hereunder. The Lenders' interests in such
obligations and liabilities, and participations in such Letters of Credit, shall
be reallocated on the Closing Date in accordance with each Lender's applicable
Percentage.

      (b) Upon its receipt of the Notes and the Note Assumptions to be delivered
hereunder on the Closing Date, each Lender will promptly return to Borrower,
marked "Cancelled" or "Replaced," the notes and note assumptions of Borrower
held by such Lender pursuant to the Original Agreement. In the event that any
Lender does not return its note or note assumption pursuant to the Original
Agreement within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Borrower shall be
entitled to receive an affidavit from such Lender with respect to the unreturned
note.

      (c) All interest and all commitment, facility and other fees and expenses
due as of the Closing Date or accruing under or in respect of the Original
Agreement shall be calculated as of the Closing Date (with the Unused Facility
Fee and Letter of Credit Fee prorated for any fractional periods), and shall be
paid on the Closing Date in accordance with the method specified in the Original
Agreement as if such agreement were still in effect.

SECTION 8.26. REPLACEMENT DOCUMENTS. Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer
of Agent or any Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a
Promissory Note or any Loan Document which is not of public record, and, in the
case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of such Promissory
Note or Loan Document, Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement
Promissory Note or Loan Document, dated the date such Promissory Note or Loan
Document was lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated, in the same principal amount
thereof and otherwise of like tenor.

                                   ARTICLE IX.

                                RELEASE OF LIENS

SECTION 9.1. RELEASE. Provided no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred hereunder and be continuing (or would exist immediately after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 9.1), Agent shall
release a Mortgaged Property from the Liens created by this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents upon the request of Borrower, subject to the following
terms and conditions:

      (a) Borrower shall deliver to Agent written notice of its desire to obtain
such release no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date upon which such
release is to be effected;

                                       70
<PAGE>

      (b) Borrower shall submit to Agent with such request a Compliance
Certificate, prepared with reference to and accompanied by pro forma financial
statements prepared in accordance with the terms of Sections 5.2 (a) through (d)
adjusted in the best good faith estimate of Borrower to give effect to the
proposed release and demonstrating that no Default or Event of Default shall
exist after giving effect to such release;

      (c) Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of Agent in
connection with such release, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees, appraisal fees and disbursements;

      (d) Borrower shall pay to Agent for the account of the Lenders an amount
equal to all Advances disbursed to fund Permitted Purposes with respect to the
Mortgaged Property in question, together with all amounts required under Section
2.15 hereof; and

      (e) The release price of the Mortgaged Property shall not be less than the
minimum amount required to cause the outstanding Advances (after giving effect
to the release of the Mortgaged Property) to remain in compliance with the
Maximum Availability Amount.

                                   ARTICLE X.
