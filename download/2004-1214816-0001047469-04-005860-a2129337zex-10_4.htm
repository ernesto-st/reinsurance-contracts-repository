<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company and the Executive desire to continue the Executive's service as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors (the

"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Term</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") commenced on September&nbsp;19, 2002 and shall continue through the close of business on December&nbsp;31, 2008, subject to earlier
termination as provided in Section&nbsp;8 below. The "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Initial Term</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall mean September&nbsp;19, 2002 through December&nbsp;31, 2003 and the

Board with
all responsibilities and authorities normally associated with such position. The Executive's services under this Agreement shall be performed outside the United States. The amount of time the
Executive spends in Bermuda and Europe shall be such time as is reasonably appropriate to perform his responsibilities and services hereunder, except for the amount of time necessary for him to attend
meetings of the Board and of committees of the Board of which he is a member. It is understood that the Executive will be domiciled in Bermuda. The Executive shall devote such time as he reasonably
deems appropriate to performing his responsibilities and services hereunder. </FONT></P>

adopted a program of employee benefit coverages. Interim coverage may be provided through purchase of separate insurance contracts, through self-insurance or, to the extent the Executive
is permitted to continue to maintain on a contributory basis the benefits he presently receives from other sources, by reimbursing the Executive for the cost thereof on a basis that keeps the
Executive whole after taxes. The Executive shall be entitled to a supplemental executive retirement benefit upon terms and conditions determined by the Board, and the Company shall provide this
benefit pursuant to a separate agreement (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>SERP Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company and the Option Holder (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Parties</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") have as of September&nbsp;19, 2002 entered into an agreement (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Service Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") pursuant to which the Option Holder is to serve the Company as Chairman of its Board of Directors; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company has decided to grant the option described below to the Option Holder as an inducement to accept such position and as a performance incentive; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the Parties agree as follows: </FONT></P>

effective as
of the Grant Date, the right and option to purchase 10,000 shares (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Option Shares</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") of the voting common shares of the Company, par value US $0.10
(the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Common Stock</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Option</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

the
purchase price of the Option Shares subject to the Option (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Option Price</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") shall be: US $100.00 per Share. </FONT></P>

Date and
continuing through the tenth anniversary of such date (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Option Period</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and shall be exercisable during the Option Period as provided in
Paragraph&nbsp;(d) below. </FONT></P>

as to
one-third of the Option Shares on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Grant Date, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided that</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Option shall vest,
and become exercisable, on certain terminations of the Optionee's service with the Company under the Service Agreement to the extent set forth in Section&nbsp;8 of the Service Agreement. Except to
the extent otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;8 of the Service Agreement, the Option shall expire on any termination of the Option Holder's service with the Company. The Option shall be exercisable
by the Option Holder, or in the event of his death or his judicially determined incompetence, by his estate or other legal representative, or, to the extent the Option is transferred, in whole or in
part, in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph&nbsp;(i) below, by a transferee of the Option (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Transferee</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). As hereinafter used, the term </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>"Option Holder"</B></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2> shall include the Option Holder's estate, other legal representative or Transferee, as appropriate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercise of the Option.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to exercise the Option, the Option Holder
shall
submit to the Company an instrument in writing specifying the number of Option Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised, accompanied by payment, in a manner reasonably acceptable to
the Company, of the aggregate Option Price for the Option Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised. A share certificate, or certificates, representing the purchased Option Shares shall
then promptly be delivered to the Option Holder; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Option Shares hereunder if
the delivery of such Option Shares would violate the provisions of any applicable law, in which event the Company shall, as soon as practicable, take whatever action it reasonably can so that such
Option Shares may be delivered without resulting in such violation of law. </FONT></P>

in other terms and conditions of this Option Agreement, and/or the Company shall promptly make appropriate provision(s) for supplemental payments of cash, securities and/or other property, in each
case so as to avoid dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Option Holder and of the after-tax economic opportunity and value represented by this Option Agreement. If an event occurs
that may require an adjustment (or other action) pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Option Holder a certificate that specifies </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>(x)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the event in question and

the Company and the Grantee (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Parties</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") have concurrently entered into an agreement (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Service

the Company has decided to grant the shares described below to the Grantee as an inducement to accept such position and as a performance incentive; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the Parties agree as follows: </FONT></P>

the Grant
Date, the Shares under this Award shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable if the Grantee is then continuing to serve the Company under the Service Agreement, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided
that</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Shares shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable on certain terminations of the Grantee's service under the Service Agreement,
under certain circumstances, as set forth in Section&nbsp;8 of the Service Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;8 of the Service Agreement, the Shares shall be forfeited on any
termination of the Grantee's service under the Service Agreement that occurs prior to the third anniversary of the Grant Date. </FONT></P>

together with any cash or property (other than securities) received in respect of such Shares as provided in Paragraph&nbsp;(d), and any associated stock powers, shall promptly be delivered to the
Grantee (or permitted transferee under Paragraph&nbsp;(e), if applicable). The Shares granted pursuant to this Agreement shall, upon delivery to the Grantee, rank equally in all respects with the
other shares of the voting Common Stock. The Shares, when delivered, shall be fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any and all liens, encumbrances, charges and
other third party rights except to the extent otherwise provided in Paragraph&nbsp;(e) below, or in the Bye-Laws of the Company. </FONT></P>
