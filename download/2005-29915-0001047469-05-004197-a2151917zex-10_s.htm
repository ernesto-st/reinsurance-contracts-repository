<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Plan Description  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan provides coverage of either one half times (1/2X) or one times (1X) your base annual salary depending on whether
you are an Hourly Employee or a Salaried Employee. If you are an Hourly Employee, the amount will depend on the applicable collective bargaining agreement. MetLife is the named fiduciary for making
decisions as to whether a Claim for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of January&nbsp;1, 2005, the following plans have been merged into the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan: The Dow Chemical Company Group Life Insurance Program's Michigan
Hourly Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan; The Dow Chemical Company Group Life Insurance Program's Hampshire Hourly Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan; and The Dow Chemical Company
Group Life Insurance Program's ANGUS Hourly Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. Such plans no longer exist as separate plans, but are now a part of The Dow Chemical Company Group Life
Insurance Program's Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility of Hourly Employees depends on whether the applicable collective bargaining unit and the Participating Employer have agreed to this Plan. With respect
to a collective bargaining agreement that specifically addresses which Employees are eligible or not eligible for this Plan, the terms of such collective bargaining agreement shall govern. If the
terms of the collective bargaining agreement specify that Hourly Employees shall be provided this Plan, but does not specifically address the category of Employees that are eligible or not eligible,
then the Plan will provide eligibility to regular, active Employees with Full Time status who are members of the collective bargaining group. </FONT></P>

experience for the policy with other policies held by Dow. This means that the costs of these coverages may be determined on a combined basis, and the costs accumulated from year to year. Favorable
experience under one or more coverages in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience on other coverages in the same year or offset unfavorable experience of coverages in prior years. Policy

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Plan Description  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan, you may select the amount of your coverage in multiples of one-half times (1/2X) your base
annual salary up to two and a half times (2<SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>2</SMALL> X)&nbsp;or six times (6X) your base annual pay, depending on whether you are an Hourly Employee or you are a Salaried Employee. If you
are an Hourly Employee, the amount will depend on the applicable collective bargaining agreement. The Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan
is a group term life insurance plan. The benefits are insured by a group term life insurance policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). MetLife pays the benefits under the
Plan. In addition, MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as to whether a Claim for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of January&nbsp;1, 2005, the following plans have been merged into the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan: Hampshire Chemical Corporation Hourly Optional Group Life
Insurance Program's Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan; ANGUS Chemical Company Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan. Such plans no
longer exist as separate plans, but are now a part of the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan is referred to in Chapter Two as the "Plan". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who are on a family or medical leave of absence approved by a Participating Employer, which leave of absence provides for eligibility for coverage under
the Plan are eligible for coverage as specified by the terms and conditions of the leave of absence. If you take an educational, sabbatical or unpaid ambassador leave of absence that has been approved
by the Participating Employer, you may continue the coverage you had as an active employee up to two times (2X) your base annual salary, for the duration of your leave. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are on a "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence", you are also eligible for coverage. A "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence" is a leave of absence, designated as a "Benefit Protected
Leave of Absence", for an Employee or group of Employees that is approved in writing by the Vice President of Human Resources during which an Employee who is not actively working for Dow may continue
coverage under the Plan. Benefit Protected Leaves of Absences automatically expire after three (3)&nbsp;months, or upon the Employee's return to active work with Dow, whichever occurs first. The
Vice President of Human Resources may renew a Benefit Protected Leave of Absence. Such renewal must be in writing. You may also be eligible if you are approved by the Participating Employer for
certain other leaves of absences. Check the Plan Document for more information. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Dependent Life Insurance  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Plan Description  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dependent Life Insurance Plan provides coverage for your eligible family members at group rates. The benefits are insured by a group term life insurance
policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). MetLife pays the benefits under the Plan. In addition, MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as to whether a Claim
for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of January&nbsp;1, 2005, the following plans have been merged into the Dependent Life Insurance Plan: Hampshire Chemical Corporation Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's
Dependent Life Insurance Plan; ANGUS Chemical Company Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's Dependent Life Insurance Plan. Such plans no longer exist as separate plans, but are now a part of
the Dependent Life Insurance Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Dependent Life Insurance Plan is referred to in Chapter Three as the "Plan"". </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaried Employees of a Participating Employer with regular, active, Full-Time or Less-Than-Full-Time status are
eligible. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility of Bargained-for Employees depends on whether the applicable collective bargaining unit and the Participating Employer have agreed to this
Plan. With respect to a collective bargaining agreement that specifically addresses which Employees are eligible or not eligible for this Plan, the terms of such collective bargaining agreement shall
govern. If the terms of the collective bargaining agreement specify that Bargained for Employees shall be provided this Plan, but does not specifically address the category of Employees that are
eligible or not eligible, then the Plan will provide eligibility to regular active Employees with Full Time status who are members of the collective bargaining group. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible Employees on a family or medical leave of absence approved by Dow or a Participating Employer are also eligible to insure eligible Dependents under this
Plan. If both you and your Spouse/Domestic Partner are eligible Employees, each may insure the other, but only one of you may insure your Dependent children. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are on a "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence", you are also eligible to insure your eligible Dependent. A "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence" is a leave of absence, designated as

Plan and to make findings of fact. Interpretations and eligibility determination by the Plan Administrator are final and binding on Participants. If you want to file&nbsp;a Claim for a Determination
of Eligibility because you are not sure whether you are eligible to participate in the Plan, or have been told that you are not, see the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claims Procedures

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees pay the entire premium for coverage. The benefits under the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance Plan are not
combined for experience with the other insurance coverages. Favorable experience under this insurance coverage in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience in prior years. It is not
anticipated that there will be any dividends declared for the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance Plan based on the manner in which the insurer has
determined the premium rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Joint Insurance Arrangement  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorinco Reinsurance Company (Dorinco) and MetLife,&nbsp;Inc. (MetLife) have entered into an arrangement that is allowed by the U.S. Department of Labor pursuant
to Prohibited Transaction Exemption 96-62 and 29 CFR Part&nbsp;2570, subpart B. [DOL Final Authorization Number 2001-17E (May&nbsp;14, 2001)]. Under
this arrangement, MetLife has or will write the coverage for the Plan and Dorinco will assume a percentage of the risk. Under the insurance arrangement between MetLife and Dorinco, MetLife and Dorinco
will each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will transfer its percentage of each
death benefit claim to MetLife. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will be obligated to pay the full amount
of the claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the entire amount of the claim. Neither
MetLife nor Dorinco will charge the Plan any administrative fees, commissions or other
consideration as a result of the participation of Dorinco. This joint insurance arrangement is not applicable to coverage for Hourly Employees employed by Michigan Operations, or their Dependents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Accelerated Benefit Option (ABO) for Spouses/Domestic Partners Only  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Accelerated Benefit Option, if your Spouse/Domestic Partner is covered under Dependent Life Insurance and has been diagnosed as having a terminal
illness, you may receive a portion of his or her Dependent Life Insurance </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>before</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> death. Having access to life proceeds at this important time could help
ease financial and emotional burdens. In order to use ABO, your Spouse/Domestic Partner must be covered for at least $10,000 from Dependent Life Insurance. You may receive an accelerated benefit of up
to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5000 and maximum $50,000) of Dependent Life if, as a result of an injury or sickness he or she is diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and from
which there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. A claim form can be obtained from the Dow Benefits Center and must be completed and returned for evaluation and approval by MetLife. </FONT></P>

the wrong (if it was the Plan which did the wrong), or will make a recommendation to the Participating Employer if any of them have been alleged to be responsible for the wrongdoing. If the Plan
Administrator determines that your allegation is without merit, you may appeal the Plan Administrator's decision. You must submit written notice of your appeal to the Plan Administrator within

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Your Legal Rights  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are a participant in the Company-Paid, Employee-Paid or Dependent Life Insurance Plans, you are entitled to certain rights and
protections under the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). This law requires that all Plan participants must be able to: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Examine,
without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, the Plan Documents and the latest annual reports filed with the U.S. Department
of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Obtain,
upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of the Plan Documents and Summary Plan Descriptions. The Administrator may charge a reasonable fee for the
copies.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Receive
a summary of each Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each Participant with a copy of this summary annual report. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to creating rights for you and all other Plan Participants, ERISA imposes duties on the people who are responsible for operating an employee benefit plan. The people who
operate the Plans, called "fiduciaries" of the Plans, have a duty to act prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
one, including your employer or any other person, may discharge you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan benefit, or from exercising
your rights under ERISA. If you have a claim for benefits </FONT></P>

certain time schedules. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the legal rights described above. For instance, if you request materials from one of the Plans and do not receive them within
30&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the
materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you must
file&nbsp;a written appeal within the time period specified in the Plan's Claims Procedures. Failure to comply with the Plan's claims procedures may significantly jeopardize your rights to benefits.
If you are not satisfied with the final appellate decision, you may file suit in Federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within 120&nbsp;days from the
date of the Claims Administrator's or the Plan Administrator's final written decision (or the deadline the Claims Administrator or Plan Administrator had to notify you of a decision). Failure to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> The court will decide who should pay court costs and
legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds
your claim is frivolous. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse one of the Plan's money, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within
120&nbsp;days from the date of the alleged misuse. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you feel that anyone is discriminating against you for exercising your rights under this benefit plan, or if you feel that someone has interfered with the attainment of any right to
which you feel you are entitled under any of the Plans, you must notify the Plan Administrator listed in the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>ERISA Information</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" section of this SPD in
writing within 120&nbsp;days of the date of the alleged wrongdoing. The Plan Administrator will investigate the allegation and respond to you in writing within 120&nbsp;days. If the Plan
Administrator determines that your allegation has merit, the Plan Administrator will either correct the wrong, if it was the Plan which did the wrong, or will make a recommendation to the Plan Sponsor
or Participating Employer if any of them have been alleged to be responsible for the wrongdoing. If the Plan Administrator determines that your allegation is without merit, you may appeal the Plan
Administrator's decision. You must submit written notice of your appeal to the Plan Administrator within 60&nbsp;days of receipt of the Plan Administrator's decision. Your appeal will be reviewed
and you will receive a written response within 60&nbsp;days. If you are not satisfied with the Plan Administrator's response to your appeal, you may file suit in Federal court. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you have any questions about the Program, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, you should
contact the nearest Office of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries,
Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and
responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare benefits, such as the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan, Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and Dependent Life Insurance Plan, are
not required to be guaranteed by a government agency. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Company's Right to Amend, Modify, and Terminate the Plans  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan, Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and
Dependent Life Insurance Plan at any time at its sole discretion. Amendments, modifications, or termination of any of the Plans that have a financial impact of U.S. $10&nbsp;million or more to The
Dow Chemical Company (Company) in any single year require the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee of the Company that the Board may authorize to act on its behalf.
Amendments, modifications, or termination of any of the Plans that have a financial impact of less than U.S. $10&nbsp;million to the Company in any single year must be signed by the President or a
Vice President of the Company and reviewed by the applicable Plan Administrator and an attorney in the Company's Legal Department. Certain modifications or amendments of the Plans which the Company
deems necessary or appropriate to conform the Plans to, or satisfy the conditions of, any law, governmental regulation or ruling, and to permit the Plans to meet the requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code may be made retroactively if necessary. Other amendments or modifications may also be made retroactively effective. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>CLAIMS PROCEDURES APPENDIX<BR>
For the Summary Plan Descriptions of the Life Insurance Plans Sponsored by<BR>
The Dow Chemical Company  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>You Must File&nbsp;a Claim in Accordance with These Claims Procedures  </I></B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>A
"Claim" is a <U>written</U> request by a claimant for a </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Plan benefit</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> or an </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility
Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. There are two kinds of Claims: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>A
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claim for Plan Benefits</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a request for benefits covered under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>An
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a kind of Claim. It is a request for a determination as to whether a claimant is eligible to be a Participant or covered
Dependent under the Plan. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>You
must follow the claims procedures for either </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS or CLAIMS FOR AN ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, whichever applies to your
situation. See the applicable sections below entitled </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR ELIGIBILITY
DETERMINATIONS.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Who Will Decide Whether to Approve or Deny My Claim?  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dow Chemical Company will approve or deny a Claim for an Eligibility Determination. The initial determination is made by the Dow Benefits Center. If you
appeal, the appellate decision is made by the Director of Global Benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MetLife
will approve or deny a Claim for Plan Benefits. MetLife is the Claims Administrator for both the initial determination and (if there is an appeal), the appellate determination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>An Authorized Representative May Act on Your Behalf  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Authorized Representative may submit a Claim on behalf of a Plan Participant. The Plan will recognize a person as a Plan Participant's "Authorized
Representative" if such person submits a notarized document signed by the Participant stating that the Authorized Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such Participant. A court order
stating that a person is authorized to submit Claims on behalf of a Participant will also be recognized by the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Authority of the Administrators and Your Rights Under ERISA  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrators have the full, complete, and final discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings of fact in order to carry out their
respective Claims decision-making responsibilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretations
and claims decisions by the Administrators are final and binding on Participants. If you are not satisfied with an Administrator's final appellate decision, you may
file&nbsp;a civil action against the Plan under s. 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in a federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so
within 120&nbsp;days from the date of the Administrator's final written decision. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may submit any additional information to the applicable Administrator when you submit your request for appeal. You may also request that the Administrator provide you copies of
documents,
records and other information that is relevant to your Claim, as determined by the applicable Administrator under applicable federal regulations. Your request must be in writing. Such information will
be provided at no cost to you. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the applicable Administrator receives your written request to appeal the initial determination, the Administrator will review your Claim. Deference will not be given to the initial
adverse decision, and the appellate reviewer will look at the Claim anew. The person who will review your appeal will not be the same person as the person who made the initial decision to deny the
Claim. In addition, the person who is reviewing the appeal will not be a subordinate who reports to the person who made the initial decision to deny the Claim. The Administrator will notify you in
writing of its final decision. Such notification will be provided within a reasonable period, not to exceed 60&nbsp;days of the written request for appellate review, except that under special
circumstances, the Administrator may have up to an additional 60&nbsp;days to provide written notification of the final decision. If the Administrator needs such an extension, it will notify you
prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, state the reason why such an extension is needed, and indicate when it will make its determination. If the Administrator determines that it
does not have sufficient information to make a decision on the Claim prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, it will notify you. It will describe any additional material or
information necessary to submit to the Plan, and provide you with the deadline for submitting such information. The initial 60&nbsp;day time period for the Administrator to make a final written
decision, plus the 60&nbsp;day extension period (if applicable) are tolled from the date the notification of insufficiency is sent to you until the date on which it receives your response. ("Tolled"
means the "clock or time is stopped or suspended". In other words, the deadline for the Administrator to make its decision is "put on hold" until it receives the requested information). The tolling
period ends when the Administrator receives your response, regardless of the adequacy of your response. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Administrator has determined to that its final decision is to deny your Claim, the written notification of the decision will state the reason(s) for the denial and refer to the
pertinent Plan provision(s). </FONT></P>
