For record-keeping purposes, all Letters of  Credit issued by the Issuing Lender shall be designated as Tranche A Letters of Credit or  Tranche B Letters of Credit. In the event that the issuance of a single Letter of Credit  would result in the aggregate LOC Amount of all Letters of Credit at the time of such  issuance exceeding the Tranche A LOC Commitment, the Issuing Lender may choose to  (a) issue two separate Letters of Credit, comprised of a Tranche A Letter of Credit (with a  face amount that, when added to the face amount of all other Tranche A Letters of Credit,  results in a LOC Amount equal to the Tranche A LOC Commitment attributable to all  Tranche A Letters of Credit) and a Tranche B Letter of Credit (with a face amount equal  to the LOC Amount attributable to all Letters of Credit in excess of the Tranche A LOC  Commitment) or (b) issue a single Tranche B Letter of Credit. Except as set forth in the  preceding sentence, no Tranche B Letters of Credit will be issued prior to the Tranche A  Availability Period End Date unless and until the Tranche A LOC Amount attributable to  issued and outstanding Tranche A Letters of Credit is greater than the Tranche A LOC  Commitment or, at the Borrower&#8217;s election in order to maintain the ability to amend the  terms of Tranche A Letters of Credit already issued, $40,000,000 (or such other amount  as agreed and confirmed in writing by the Issuing Lender in its sole discretion). Subject  to Section 2.08, no Tranche A Letter of Credit will be issued after the Tranche A  Availability Period End Date and no Tranche B Letter of Credit will be issued after the  Tranche B Availability Period End Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that  any Tranche A Letters of Credit are expiring on a date after the Tranche A Availability  Period End Date, such Tranche A Letter of Credit, subject to the terms and conditions set  forth in this Agreement, shall be automatically renewed as a Tranche B Letter of Credit  so long the Tranche B LOC Exposure will not exceed the Tranche B LOC Commitment  as a result of such renewal.  Any Tranche A Letters of Credit outstanding on the effective  date of this Agreement shall continue to be Tranche A Letters of Credit and any Tranche  B Letters of Credit outstanding on the effective date of this Agreement shall continue to  be Tranche B Letters of Credit.  &sect; 3 Conditions to Effectiveness of this Amendment.
