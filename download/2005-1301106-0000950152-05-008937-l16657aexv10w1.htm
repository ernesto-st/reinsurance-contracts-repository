existing restrictions on the Company&#146;s Operations in the State of Texas as described in
Disclosure Schedule&nbsp;3.1.9; and (iii)&nbsp;providing reasonable cooperation in the Purchaser&#146;s
preparation of the Company&#146;s 2005 Annual Statement. If Purchaser requests assistance
following the Closing that is, in Seller&#146;s reasonable judgment, extraordinary, Seller shall

Following the execution of this Agreement, Seller will provide Purchaser with contact

are properly attributable to the Company&#146;s business will be promptly forwarded to Purchaser
as provided in the Agency Agreement. Seller also agrees to provide a data transfer to be
accomplished by delivery in a SQL 2000 database as soon as reasonably possible following the
Closing but in no event more than five business days thereafter. Seller agrees to provide
Purchaser with a test database as soon as reasonably possible after the execution of this

Company&#146;s business, and (ii)&nbsp;prevent any liability under these letters of credit from being
attributed to Company or Purchaser and to prevent the presentation of a draw against any of
such letters of credit. In furtherance of this objective, and not by way of limitation,
Purchaser agrees to use reasonable efforts to transfer any remaining active customers whose
coverage was written by the Kemper group of insurance companies and reinsured by Triumphe
(including both Physical Damage and Non-Trucking Liability coverages) from the current
Kemper policies to policies written directly by National Interstate.
Seller will cooperate with Purchaser to effectuate this transfer, which will then allow
Seller to cancel the Kemper policies and remove any prospective risk from the Kemper
companies.

Escrow Agreement (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;) is made and

2005, by and among TRIUMPHE INSURANCE HOLDINGS LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(&#147;<U>Seller</U>&#148;), NATIONAL INTERSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY, an Ohio corporation
(&#147;<U>Purchaser</U>&#148;), and KEYBANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking association, as escrow
agent (the &#147;<U>Escrow Agent</U>&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Seller and Purchaser have entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of
September&nbsp;30, 2005 (the &#147;<U>Purchase Agreement</U>&#148;), pursuant to which, among other things,
Seller has agreed to sell, and Purchaser has agreed to purchase, all of the Triumphe Shares.
Seller and Purchaser are required under the terms of the Purchase Agreement to enter into this
Agreement;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, this Agreement sets forth the rights and obligations of Seller, Purchaser, and the
Escrow Agent concerning the opening, administration, and closing of the escrow account required to
be established pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; and

meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, Seller, Purchaser, and the Escrow Agent hereby agree as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%"><B>1.The Escrow Account.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">1.1 <U>Establishment of the Escrow Account.</U> No later than November&nbsp;30, 2005, Purchaser shall deposit with
the Escrow Agent the Closing Payment in immediately available funds (the &#147;<U>Escrow Amount</U>&#148;).
The Escrow Amount and all interest and earnings accrued on the Escrow Amount are hereinafter called
the &#147;Escrow Funds.&#148; The Escrow Funds shall be held and applied by Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms set forth in this Agreement.

upon receipt of the Escrow Amount: (a)&nbsp;deposit the Escrow Amount in a separate account maintained
by the Escrow Agent; and (b)&nbsp;provide written notice to Seller and Purchaser of the Escrow Agent&#146;s
receipt of the Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Amount in money market
instruments. Any interest and earnings on the Escrow Funds shall, until disbursed in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, be reinvested by the Escrow Agent in the same manner as the
Escrow Amount. Except as set forth in Section&nbsp;2.2 of the Purchase Agreement, interest and earnings
on the Escrow Funds shall inure to the benefit of Seller and accrue in the escrow account so long
as any unpaid portion of the Purchase Price remains in the escrow account for the benefit of
Seller. The Escrow Agent shall inform Seller and Purchaser about the state of the Escrow Funds,
and the interest and earnings thereon, upon the written request of Seller or Purchaser.
