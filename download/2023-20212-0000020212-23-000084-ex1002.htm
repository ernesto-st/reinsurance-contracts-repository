SECTION 1.09. Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification. The interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, which is derived from the London interbank offered rate.  The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market.  In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the &#8220;IBA&#8221;) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on LIBOR Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate.  Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election, Section 5.02(d) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest with respect to the Revolving Facility and the Term B-1 Facility.  Administrative Agent will promptly notify Borrower, pursuant to Section 5.02(f), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is based.  However, Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of &#8220;LIBO - 92- </FONT></DIV>

Subject to Section 4.04, Borrower shall have the right to prepay Loans (without premium(a) or penalty, except as provided in Section 2.09(c) and Section 2.09(d)) of a Tranche, or to convert Loans of a Tranche of one Type into Loans of such Tranche of another Type or to continue Loans of a Tranche of one Type as Loans of such Tranche of the same Type, at any time or from time to time.  Borrower shall give Administrative Agent notice of each such prepayment, conversion or continuation as provided in Section 4.05 (and, upon the date specified in any such notice of prepayment, the amount to be prepaid shall become due and payable hereunder; provided that Borrower may make any such notice conditional upon the occurrence of a Person&#8217;s acquisition or sale or any incurrence of indebtedness or issuance of Equity Interests).

If Borrower makes such an election, it shall provide notice thereof to Administrative Agent, who shall promptly, and in any event within one Business Day of receipt, provide such notice to the holders of the Term Loans (other than the Term A Facility Loans).

Non-Receipt of Funds by Administrative Agent.SECTION 4.06. Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the(a) proposed date of any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans or Term Benchmark Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of ABR Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s share of such Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of ABR Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.

Credit Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedging Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221; and each such QFC a &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Credit Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): (a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Credit Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Credit Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. (b) As used in this Section 13.21, the following terms have the following meanings: &#8220;BHC Act Affiliate&#8221; of a party means an &#8220;affiliate&#8221; (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party. &#8220;Covered Entity&#8221; means any of the following: (i) a &#8220;covered entity&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 252.82(b); (ii) a &#8220;covered bank&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 47.3(b); or (iii) a &#8220;covered FSI&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 382.2(b). &#8220;Default Right&#8221; has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable. -241- </FONT></DIV>
