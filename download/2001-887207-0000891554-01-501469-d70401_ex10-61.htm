reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such

failed to do so within three Domestic Business Days of demand therefor by the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent

4.12. <I>ERISA</I>. As of the Closing Date, the Borrower is responsible for
funding no Plans other than those listed on the Schedule having the same number
as this Section. No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) or Reportable Event has occurred with respect
to any Plan which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. There are no Unfunded Liabilities under any Plan which when added to the
aggregate amount of Unfunded Liabilities with respect to all other Plans at such
time could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Borrower and each member of the ERISA Controlled Group have not failed to comply
with the requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with respect to any Multiemployer
Plan and are not in &#147;default&#148; (as defined in Section 4219(c)(5) of
ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer Plan to an extent which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The aggregate
potential total withdrawal liability payments of the Borrower and the members of
the ERISA Controlled Group as determined in accordance with Title IV of ERISA as
if the Borrower and the members of the ERISA Controlled Group had completely
withdrawn from all Multiemployer Plans is not equal to or greater than an amount
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Borrower and each member of the ERISA Controlled Group, no
Multiemployer Plan is or is likely to be in reorganization (as defined in
Section 4241 or ERISA or Section 418 of the Code) or is insolvent (as defined in
Section 4245 of ERISA). No liability to the PBGC (other than required premium
payments), the Internal Revenue Service, any Plan or any trust established under
Title IV of ERISA has been, or is expected by the Borrower or any member of the
ERISA Controlled Group to be, incurred by the Borrower or any member of the
ERISA Controlled Group which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or 302(f) of ERISA or requirement to
provide security under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or Section 307 of ERISA has been or
is reasonably expected by the Borrower or any member of the ERISA Controlled Group to be
imposed on the assets of the Borrower or any member of the ERISA Controlled Group. With
respect to any employee benefit plan covered under Title IV of ERISA that is excluded
from the definition of Plan by the proviso at the end of such definition, no liability,
penalty, Lien or security interest has been incurred or is expected to be incurred which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and to the Borrower&#146;s
knowledge no other event or condition has occurred or exists which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  </FONT></P>

The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Agent and Bank, their respective affiliates and the
respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an
"Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not
such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans
hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder
for such Indemnitee's (i) own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (ii) default in
the performance of its own express contractual duties to the Borrower, in each case as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. </FONT></P>

11.4. <I>Sharing of Set-offs</I>. Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by
exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of
a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then due with
respect to any Note held by it which is greater than the proportion received by
any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then
due with respect to any Note held by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such
proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Notes
held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be
required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the
Notes held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; <I>provided</I>
that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any
right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to
such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its
indebtedness hereunder. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may
effectively do so under applicable Law, that any holder of a participation in a
Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may
exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such
participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. </FONT></P>

Notes may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights
or duties of any Agent are affected thereby, by such Agent); <I>provided</I>
that no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i)
increase or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease
in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any additional
obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or any
interest thereon or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any
payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or interest thereon or any fees
hereunder or for the termination of any Commitment, (iv) change the definition
of &#147;Required Banks&#148; under Section 1.01 or (v) change the
percentage of the Commitments or of
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Banks, which shall
be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section or any
other provision of this Agreement.  </FONT></P>

11.6. <I>Successors and Assigns</I>. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer (other than pursuant to a Permitted Transaction) any of its
rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each a
"Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. If a
Bank grants any such participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the
performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may
grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole
right and responsibility to enforce the Borrower's obligations hereunder including,
without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that
such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement
described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 11.05 without the consent of the
Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in
its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 and Article 10
with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not
permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this
Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this
subsection. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other institutions (each an
"Assignee") all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an initial Commitment of not less
than $10,000,000) of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
Notes, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an
Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto signed
by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the subscribed consent
of the Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the Administrative Agent;
provided that (i) if an Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank
immediately before such assignment, no such consent of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent shall be required and (ii) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
no such consent of the Borrower shall be required. When such instrument has been signed
and delivered by the parties thereto and such Assignee has paid to such transferor
Bank the purchase price agreed
between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to
this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment
as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released
from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or
action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant
to this subsection, the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall
make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee.
In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the
Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount
of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States or a
state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certification as to
exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in
accordance with Section 10.03.  </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the foregoing and to further qualifications and limitations set forth below,
I am of the opinion that: </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all
material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required
to carry on its business as now conducted. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Bridge Loan
Agreement and the Notes (a) are within the Borrower&#146;s corporate powers, (b)
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (c) do not require
any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or
official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision
of applicable Law or regulation or of the Borrower&#146;s certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or, to the best of my knowledge, of any material
agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon
the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
The Bridge Loan Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Borrower and each Note issued thereunder today constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with its
terms. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
There is no action, suit or proceeding pending against, or to the best of my

Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or
official which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or
which in any manner draws into question the validity of the Bridge Loan
Agreement or the Notes. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
Each of the Borrower&#146;s corporate Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation,
