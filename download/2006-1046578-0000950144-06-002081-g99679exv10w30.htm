<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Leverage Ratio, the Applicable Margin shall be determined upon delivery of
the Compliance Certificate pursuant to Section&nbsp;6.1(c), after the end of each fiscal quarter,
commencing with the Compliance Certificate delivered for the fiscal quarter ending June&nbsp;30, 2006.
The Applicable Margin shall automatically be adjusted to the rate corresponding to the Leverage
Ratio set forth in the grid above. Such automatic adjustment shall take effect on the last day
that the Compliance Certificate was required to be delivered, and shall remain in effect until
subsequently adjusted in accordance herewith upon the delivery of each such subsequent Compliance
Certificate. In the case of the Ratings, the Applicable Margin shall be determined upon any change
in such Ratings. The Applicable Margin shall automatically be adjusted to the rate corresponding
to the Ratings set forth in the grid above. Such automatic adjustment shall take effect (i)&nbsp;in
case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, as of the beginning of the next succeeding applicable Interest
Period for Eurodollar Loans, and (ii)&nbsp;in case of Base Rate Loans, as of the next Business Day
following the date of such change in the Ratings.

more than 120&nbsp;days nor less than 90&nbsp;days prior to each anniversary of the Effective Date. At the
time of or prior to the delivery of such request, the Borrower shall propose to the Administrative
Agent the amount of the fees that the Borrower agrees to pay with respect to such one-year
extension if approved by Lenders (such request for an extension, together with the fee proposal,
being herein referred to as the &#147;<U>Extension Request</U>&#148;). Promptly upon (but not later than
five (5)&nbsp;Business Days after) receipt of the Extension Request, the Administrative Agent shall

Request. Each Lender approving the Extension Request (the &#147;<U>Consenting Lenders</U>&#148;) shall

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the
Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Requisite Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30&nbsp;days after
the retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent,
selected from among the Lenders. In either case, such appointment shall be subject to the prior
written approval of the Borrower (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld and shall not be
required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default). Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Prior to any retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s resignation hereunder as Administrative
Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary
