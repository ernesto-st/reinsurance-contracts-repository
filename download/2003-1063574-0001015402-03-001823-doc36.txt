                         ------------------      --------
and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of
Letters of Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
after the Effective Date and before the date that is five business days prior to
the Revolving Maturity Date.  In the event of any inconsistency between the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form
of letter of


                                       26
<PAGE>
credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered
into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

          (b)     Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
                  ----------------------------------------------------------
Conditions.  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
-----------
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall
hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication or by
telephonic notice so long as promptly followed by hand delivery or telecopy or
electronic communication, in each case if arrangements for doing so have been
approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent
(reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or
identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and
specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be
a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which
shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of
Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other
information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter
of Credit.  If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a
letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection
with any request for a Letter of Credit.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued,
amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and
warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $25,000,000 and (ii) the total
Exposures shall not exceed the Available Amount.

          (c)     Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or
                  ----------------
prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the
date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

          (d)     Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
                  ---------------
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing
Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender
hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each
LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on
the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.


                                       27
<PAGE>
          (e)     Reimbursement.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
                  --------------
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business
Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt, provided that
                                                                 --------
the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein,
request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an
ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the
Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by
the resulting ABR Borrowing.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when
due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC
Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such
Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such
notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders),
                  ------- --------
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts
so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing
Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than
the funding of ABR Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and
shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.

          (f)     Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower's obligation to reimburse
                  ---------------------
LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit, any application for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or this
Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document
presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of
such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the
provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder.  None
of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank, or any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other

                                       28
<PAGE>
communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document
required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical
terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing
Bank, provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing
      --------
Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as
opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived
by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the
Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

          (g)     Disbursement Procedures.  The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
                  ------------------------
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder, provided that any failure to give or
                                         --------
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

          (h)     Interim Interest.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
                  -----------------
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans, provided that,
                                                                  --------
if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due or finance such
LC Disbursement with an ABR Borrowing pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section,
then Section 2.11(c) shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph
shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on
and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to
the extent of such payment.

          (i)     Replacement of the Issuing Bank.  The Issuing Bank may be
                  --------------------------------
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.  The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the
Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.10(b).  From and after the effective date of
any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights
and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters
of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
"Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing


                                       29
<PAGE>
Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall
require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced
Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the
rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

          (j)     Cash Collateralization.  If the Commitments have been
                  -----------------------
terminated or the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, on the Business
Day that the Borrower receives notice of such acceleration or termination from
the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, the Borrower shall deposit in
an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative
Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 105% of the
LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become
--------
effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and
payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of
Article VII.  The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this
paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.09(b), and any such cash
collateral so deposited and held by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
constitute part of the Borrowing Base for purposes of determining compliance
with Section 2.09(b).  Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative
Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive
dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such
account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits,
which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall
not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall
accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account deposited pursuant to the
first sentence of this clause (j) or pursuant to Section 2.09(b) shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure
representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy
other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.  If the maturity of the
Loans has been accelerated, moneys in such account deposited pursuant to Section
2.09(c) shall be applied to satisfy the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral
hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to
the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within
three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.  If
the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder
pursuant to Section 2.09(b) or elects to provide cash collateral pursuant to
Section 2.09(c), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be
returned to the Borrower as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such
return, the Borrower would remain in compliance with Section 2.09(b) or (c) and
no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

          SECTION 2.05.  Funding of Borrowings.      Each Lender shall make each
                         ----------------------
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders.  The Administrative


                                       30
<PAGE>
Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the
amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained
with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Borrower in
the applicable Borrowing Request, provided that ABR Loans made to finance the
                                  --------
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

          (b)     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.06.  Interest Elections.      Each Borrowing initially shall
                         -------------------
be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of
a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in
such Borrowing Request (or in Section 2.03 if no Interest Period is specified in
such Borrowing Request).  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such
Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of
a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in
this Section.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to
different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion
shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing.

          (b)     To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower
were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made
on the effective date of such election.  Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

          (c)     Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 and paragraph
(f) of this Section:

          (ii)     the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies
     and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
     portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting
     Borrowing (in which case the information to be


                                       31
<PAGE>
     specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for
     each resulting Borrowing);

          (iii)     the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
     Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iv)     whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or
     a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

          (v)     if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
     Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
     election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
     term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

          (d)     Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request,
the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of
such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

          (e)     If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided
herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the
request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an
Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to
or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar
Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto.

          SECTION 2.07.  Termination and Reduction of Commitments.      Unless
                         -----------------------------------------
previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Maturity
Date.

          (b)     The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Commitments, provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments
                         --------
shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less
than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the
Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in
accordance with Section 2.09, the total Exposures would exceed the total
Commitments.

          (c)     The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable, provided that a notice
                                                        --------
of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such
notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of


                                       32
<PAGE>
other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the
Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified
effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction
of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall
be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Commitments.

          SECTION 2.08.  Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.      The Borrower
                         -------------------------------------
hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan of such
Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date.

          (b)     Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

          (c)     The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

          (d)     The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
                                              ----- -----
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein, provided that the
                                                           --------
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (e)     Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

          SECTION 2.09.  Prepayment of Loans.      The Borrower shall have the
                         --------------------
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in
part, subject to the requirements of this Section.

          (b)     In the event and on such occasion that the total Exposures
exceeds the Available Amount, the Borrower shall prepay Borrowings (or, if no
such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an account with the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(j)) in an aggregate amount equal
to such excess.


                                       33
<PAGE>
          (c)     The Borrower shall (i) repay or prepay outstanding Loans and
(ii) refrain from making additional Borrowings or requesting the issuance of
additional Letters of Credit to the extent necessary in order that there shall
be (a) a period of 15 consecutive days in fiscal year 2004 of the Borrower and
(b) a period of 30 consecutive days in each fiscal year thereafter, during which
the total Exposures (excluding the LC Exposure) is equal to zero, provided that
                                                                  --------
the Borrower may elect at the commencement of any such period to deposit cash
collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent (pursuant to Section
2.04(j)) in an amount equal to $4,000,000, in which case the total Exposures
(excluding the LC Exposure) shall be reduced to not more than $4,000,000.

          (d)     Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings
hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid
and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section.

          (e)     The Borrower shall notify the Administrative  Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR  Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each
Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory
prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment,
provided that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a
--------
conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section
2.07, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of
termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07.  Promptly following
receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of
the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an
amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the
same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the
required amount of a mandatory prepayment.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall
be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.  Prepayments
shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.11.

          SECTION 2.10.  Fees.     for the account of each Lender a commitment
                         -----
fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.50% on the average daily unused amount
of the Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates.
Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of
March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the
Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof.  All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day).

          (b)     The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate as interest on Eurodollar Loans on the average daily amount of such
Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed
LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but


                                       34
<PAGE>
excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and
the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the
Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum
on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and
including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of
termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC
Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing
of drawings thereunder.  Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through
and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year
shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing
on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date, provided that all such
                                                          --------
fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any
such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be
payable on demand.  Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this
paragraph shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand.  All
participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day).

          (c)     The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for
its own account, fees (including collateral monitoring fees) payable in the
amounts and at the times separately agreed upon in writing between the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent.

          (d)     All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto.  Fees
paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

          SECTION 2.11.  Interest.      The Loans composing each ABR Borrowing
                         ---------
shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

          (b)     The Loans composing each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

          (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest
on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

          (d)     Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the
Commitments, provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of
             --------
this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or
prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end
of the Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount
repaid or


                                       35
<PAGE>
prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii)
in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the
current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable
on the effective date of such conversion.

          (e)     All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate
or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.12.  Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the
                         ---------------------------
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

          (a)     the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
     be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
     not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period;
     or

          (b)     the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders
     that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately
     and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their
     Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any  Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.13.  Increased Costs.      If any Change in Law shall:
                         ----------------

          (ii)     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
     deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
     account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
     requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

          (iii)     impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London
     interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar
     Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrower will


                                       36
<PAGE>
pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b)     If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change
in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the
capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters
of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's
or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

          (c)     A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth
the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or
its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten Business
Days after receipt thereof.

          (d)     Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank
to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation, provided
                                                                       --------
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing
Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred
more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change
                                          --------  -------
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

          SECTION 2.14.  Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the
                         -----------------------
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section
2.09(e) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any
Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17, then,
in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost
and expense attributable to such event.  In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such
loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount
determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest that would have accrued on the principal amount


                                       37
<PAGE>
of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would
have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to
the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a
failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the
Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such
Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

          SECTION 2.15.  Taxes.      Any and all payments by or on account of
                         ------
any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any
             --------
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section)
the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall
pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

          (b)     In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c)     The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for
the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing
Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          (d)     As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e)     Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty


                                       38
<PAGE>
to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this
Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly
completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Foreign Lender has received
                                  --------
written notice from the Borrower advising it of the availability of such
exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation.

          SECTION 2.16.  Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
                         --------------------------------------------------
Set-offs.      The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
---------
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees
or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.13,
2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) not later than the time expressly required hereunder
or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is
expressly required, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time), on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as
expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.13,
2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and
payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified
therein.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received
by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate Person promptly
following receipt thereof.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due
on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

          (b)     If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

          (c)     If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in
such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of
its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon
than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC


                                       39
<PAGE>
Disbursements, provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and
               --------
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent
of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph
shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to
and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

          (d)     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

          (e)     If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be
made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or (e), 2.05(b), 2.16(d) or 9.03(c), then
the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under
such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

          SECTION 2.17.  Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.      If
                         -----------------------------------------------
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the
case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.


                                       40
<PAGE>
          (b)     If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if
the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that (i) the Borrower
                                              --------
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and
the Issuing Bank, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such
Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and
fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case
of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section
2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment
will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender
shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior
thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances
entitling the Borrower to require such  assignment and delegation cease to
apply.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

Properties), except for minor defects in title that do not

to use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual
property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for
any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          (c)     Schedule 3.05 sets forth the address of each real property
that is owned or leased by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Date after giving effect to the Transactions.

Subsidiaries has received notice of, or has knowledge of, any pending or
contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting any Mortgaged Property or any

Property nor any interest therein is subject to any right of first refusal,
option or other contractual right to purchase any such Mortgaged Property or
interest therein.

          SECTION 3.06.  Litigation and Environmental Matters.   There are no
                         -------------------------------------
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries (i) as to which
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed
Matters) or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.

          (b)     Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to
any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably

it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding
upon it or its property.  No Default has occurred and is continuing.

          SECTION 3.08.  Investment and Holding Company Status.  None of the
                         --------------------------------------
Borrower or the Subsidiary Loan Parties is (a) an "investment company" as
defined in, or subject


                                       43

to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding
company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935.

                         ------
timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have

paid by it, except (a) any Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as

that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.10.  ERISA.  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10, no ERISA
                         ------
Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together
with all other ERISA Events that have occurred, could reasonably be expected to
result in liability of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount
exceeding (i) $3,000,000 in any year or (ii) $5,000,000 in all periods.  The
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on
the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements
reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $35,000,000 the fair market value
of the assets of such Plan, and the present value of all accumulated benefit
obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $35,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded
Plans.

          SECTION 3.11.  Disclosure.  The Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders
                         -----------
(or disclosed in a filing with the Court prior to the date hereof) all
agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which the
Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries is subject, and all matters known to any of
them, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Disclosure Statement nor the
reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished,
taken as a whole, by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as modified or supplemented
by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
provided that, with respect to projected financial information the Borrower
--------
represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

          SECTION 3.12.  Subsidiaries.  Schedule 3.12 sets forth the name of,
                         -------------

                         --------------
strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending
or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened.  The hours worked by and
payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in
violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal,
state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters.  All payments due from
the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare
insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the
books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary.  The consummation of the Transactions
will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on the
part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the
Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.

          SECTION 3.15.  Solvency.  On the Effective Date and at all times

thereafter, (a) the fair value of the assets of (i) the Borrower, (ii) World
Kitchen, Inc. and (iii) the Loan Parties, on a consolidated basis, at a fair
valuation, will exceed its or their debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of
(i) the Borrower, (ii) World Kitchen, Inc. and (iii) the Loan Parties, on a
consolidated basis, will be greater than the amount that it or they will be
required to pay the probable liability of its debts and other liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured; (c) (i) the Borrower, (ii) World Kitchen, Inc. and
(iii) the Loan Parties, on a consolidated basis, will be able to pay its or
their debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) (i) the Borrower,
(ii) World Kitchen, Inc. and (iii) the Loan Parties, on a consolidated basis,
will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in
which it or they are engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed
to be conducted following the Effective Date.

          SECTION 3.16.  Security Documents.      The Collateral Agreement is
                         -------------------
effective to create, for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Obligations,
a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined
in the Collateral Agreement) and, when such Collateral is delivered to the
Collateral Agent and for so long as the Collateral Agent remains in possession
of such Collateral or when financing statements in appropriate form are filed in
the offices specified in the Perfection Certificate, as applicable, the security
interest created by the Collateral Agreement shall constitute a perfected first
priority security interest in all right, title and interest of the pledgor
thereunder in such Collateral, in each case prior and superior in right to any
other Person, other than with respect to the rights of Persons pursuant to Liens
permitted by Section 6.02.

          (b)     The Mortgages are effective to create, subject to the
exceptions listed in each title insurance policy covering such Mortgage, for the
ratable benefit of the holders of the Obligations, a legal, valid and
enforceable Lien on all the applicable mortgagor's right, title and interest in
and to the Mortgaged Properties thereunder, and when the Mortgages are filed in
the offices specified in the Perfection Certificate, the Lien created by each
Mortgage shall constitute a perfected Lien on all right, title and interest of
the applicable mortgagor in such Mortgaged Properties, in each case prior and
superior in right to any other Person, other than with respect to the rights of
Persons pursuant to Liens permitted by Section 6.02.

                         ----------------
used solely for the purposes set forth in and permitted by Section 5.11.  None
of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries is generally engaged in the business of
purchasing or selling Margin Stock or extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

          Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

          The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

          The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,
any information relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary that is communicated
to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for
any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence
of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent
shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written
notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender,
and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii)
the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms
or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of
items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.


                                       70
<PAGE>
          The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

          The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of each Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor the
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which
shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any
such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder
or thereunder.

          SECTION 9.02.  Waivers; Amendments.      No failure or delay by the
                         --------------------
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver
of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan
Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan
or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the


                                       72
<PAGE>
Collateral Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or
knowledge of such Default at the time.

          (b)     Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are
parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders, provided
                                                                        --------
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(iii) postpone the final maturity of any Loan, or the required date of
reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any
interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any
such scheduled payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv)
change Section 2.16(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing
of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v)
change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in the
definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan
Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend
or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) release any
Subsidiary Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Collateral Agreement (except
as expressly provided in the Collateral Agreement), or limit its liability in
respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii)
release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the
Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) amend the
definitions of any of the terms "Borrowing Base", "Dilution Percentage" or
"Dilution Reserve" or any of the terms therein (other than any change to the
definitions of Borrowing Base, Dilution Percentage or Dilution Reserve that is
more restrictive to the Borrower), without the written consent of Lenders having
Exposures and unused Commitments representing at least 75% of the total
Exposures and unused Commitments at such time, (ix) amend or waive Sections
6.13, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16 or 6.17 without the written consent of Lenders having
Exposures and unused Commitments representing at least 75% of the total
Exposures and unused Commitments at such time or (x) increase the aggregate
amount of the Commitments above $90,000,000 without the written consent of
Lenders having Exposures and unused Commitments representing at least 75% of the
total Exposures and unused Commitments at such time; provided, further that (A)
                                                     -----------------
no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties
of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Collateral Agent without
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Collateral Agent, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered
into by the Borrower, the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if
its rights or obligations are affected thereby, the Issuing Bank) if (i) by the
terms of such agreement the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the
amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such
amendment and (ii) at the time such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not
consenting thereto receives payment in full of the principal of and interest
accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for
its account under this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.03.  Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.      The Borrower
                         -----------------------------------
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their respective Affiliates,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and
administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers
of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal
or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and
(iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent,  the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges
and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in
connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or
in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder,
including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

          (b)     The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of
any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee")
                                                                ----------
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against
any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the
execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of
their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions
or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit
or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank
to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents
presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms
of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release of
Hazardous Materials on or from any Mortgaged Property or any other property
currently or formerly owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower
or any of the Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a
party thereto, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
               --------
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of such Indemnitee.

          (c)     To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, or
the Issuing Bank under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined
as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is
sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or
                               --------
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may
be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as


                                       74
<PAGE>
such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based
upon its share of the sum of the total Exposures and unused Commitments at the
time.

          (d)     To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall
not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory
of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as
opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby,
the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds
thereof.

          (e)     All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
after written demand therefor.

          SECTION 9.04.  Successors and Assigns.      The provisions of this
                         -----------------------
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing
Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated
hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

          (b)     Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it), provided  that
                                                                  --------
(i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or
an Approved Fund, each of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing
Bank must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to
a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining
amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the
Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise
consent, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500, (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire and (vi) in the case of an assignment to a CLO, the assigning
Lender shall retain the sole right to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement, provided, in the case of this clause
                                           --------
(vi), that the Assignment and Acceptance between such Lender and such CLO may
provide that such Lender shall not, without the consent of such CLO, agree to
any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
9.02(b) that

                                       75
<PAGE>
affects such CLO; provided, further, that any consent of the Borrower otherwise
                  --------  -------
required under this paragraph shall not be required if a Default has occurred
and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in
each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (e) of this Section.

          (c)     The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a
copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in
                                                     --------
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall
be available for inspection by the Borrower and the Issuing Bank at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (d)     Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

          (e)     Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
                            -----------
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans owing to it), provided that (i) such Lender's
                                       --------
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver
of any provision of the Loan


                                       76
<PAGE>
Documents, provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
           --------
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that
affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower
agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13,
2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
                                         --------
subject to Section 2.16(c) as though it were a Lender.

          (f)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.13 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
2.15(e) as though it were a Lender.

          (g)     Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest, provided that no such pledge
                                                  --------
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

          SECTION 9.05.  Survival.  All covenants, agreements, representations
                         ---------
and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any
Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and
so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The provisions of
Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in
full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination
of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

          SECTION 9.06.  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This
                         -----------------------------------------
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees
payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the


                                       77
<PAGE>
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of
the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.07.  Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to
                         -------------
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

          SECTION 9.08.  Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have
                         ----------------
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although
such obligations may be unmatured.  The rights of each Lender under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

          SECTION 9.09.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
                         --------------------------------------------------
Process.      This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
--------
by the law of the State of New York.

          (b)     The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United
States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and
each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that
all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document against the Borrower or its properties in the courts
of any jurisdiction.


                                       78
<PAGE>
          (c)     The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

          (d)     Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

          SECTION 9.10.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
                         ---------------------
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN  ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

          SECTION 9.11.  Headings.  Article and Section headings and the Table
                         ---------
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into

          SECTION 9.12.  Confidentiality.  Each of the  Administrative Agent,
                         ----------------
the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent, and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information

assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of

--------
date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as
confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of

                         -------------------------
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,

taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
