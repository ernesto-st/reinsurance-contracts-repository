      SECTION 6.06. LEGAL OPINION.

            (a) The Purchaser shall have received an opinion of Ice Miller, or
      other counsel reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, as special counsel to
      Sellers and SIG (which opinion need not cover Goran even if such counsel
      also represents Goran), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
      Purchaser, to the effect that:

                  (i) Each Seller and SIG is a corporation duly incorporated and
            validly existing as such under the laws of the state of its
            incorporation, and each Seller and Shareholder has the requisite
            corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
            properties as now owned, leased or operated and to conduct its
            business as presently conducted.

                  (ii) Each Seller and SIG has the requisite corporate power and
            authority to execute and deliver the Transfer Documents to which it
            is a party, and the execution and delivery of the Transfer Documents
            by each Seller and SIG have been duly authorized by all requisite
            corporate action. Each of the Transfer Documents to which Sellers
            and SIG are a party constitute valid and binding obligations of
            Sellers and SIG, enforceable against each of them in accordance with
            their respective terms. Except as is provided in the Agreement or
            any Schedule or supplemental schedule thereto, Sellers and SIG are
            not required to


                                       60
<PAGE>

            obtain any authorization, approval or consent of any governmental or
            regulatory body or other authority under Federal or State law in
            connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Sellers
            or SIG of the Transfer Documents to which they are a party.

                  (iii) To such counsel's knowledge, and except as may be set
            forth in the Agreement or any Schedule or supplemental schedule
            thereto, there is no pending or threatened action, suit, claim,
            investigation or proceeding before any judicial or governmental
            authority that would question the validity of, or interfere with the
            power or authority of any or all of Sellers and SIG to enter into,
            and perform their respective obligations under the Transfer
            Documents to which they are a party.

            Such opinion may include assumptions, qualifications, exceptions,
      and limitations generally applicable to opinions of this type, including
      but not limited to a general qualification to the extent that the
      enforceability of any provision of the aforementioned agreements or
      instruments, or any rights pursuant to those agreements or instruments,
      may be subject to or affected by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
      reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights of
      creditors generally. Counsel may except from its opinion (among other
      exceptions generally applicable to opinions of this type) (i) any opinion
      as to the availability of any equitable remedy upon any breach of any of
      the covenants, warranties or other provisions contained in any of such
      agreements or instruments or the validity or enforceability of any
      provision in the Transfer Documents or any agreement or instrument related
      thereto regarding noncompete or confidentiality restrictions or that
      purports to prevent oral modification or waivers of any provisions thereof
      and (ii) any opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent


                                       61
<PAGE>

      transfer or similar law on the Transfer Documents or any transaction
      contemplated thereby.

            (b) The Purchaser shall have received an opinion of John Sheeley, as
      corporate counsel for IGFH and IGF, in form and substance reasonably
      acceptable to Purchaser, to the effect that (1) the Transfer Documents are
      sufficient to vest in and convey to Purchaser all right, title and
      interest of Sellers in and to the Transferred Assets, and that upon
      completion of the Closing, Purchaser will have good and marketable title
      in such Transferred Assets; and (2) the execution and delivery by the
      Sellers of the Transfer Documents to which they are a party, the
      consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and the performance
      of their respective obligations thereunder (i) do not contravene any
      provision of the respective certificate or articles of incorporation or
      bylaws of the Sellers, (ii) will not result in the violation of any order,
      writ, judgment, injunction or decree issued by any governmental or
      judicial body to which any or all of the Purchasers or their respective
      property is bound, (iii) will not constitute or otherwise result in a
      breach or default under the provisions of any material indenture,
      mortgage, loan agreement or other material contract to which any or all of
      the Sellers or their respective property is bound or (iv) will not result
      in the creation or imposition of any lien, security interest, charge or
      other encumbrance pursuant to any applicable law, rule or statute or the
      provisions of any material indenture, mortgage, loan agreement or other
      material contract to which any or all of the Sellers or their respective
      property is bound.

and declarations required to be obtained prior to the Closing Date from,

those, the failure of which to be obtained or taken, individually or in the
whole, could not be reasonably expected to have a Sellers Material Adverse
Effect; provided, however, that such exception shall not apply with respect to
the consents, approvals, authorizations and declarations required to be obtained
with respect to the SRA Assignment and Assumption Agreement, under the HSR Act,
if any, and under applicable state insurance laws.

      SECTION 6.08. NO INJUNCTIONS OR RESTRAINTS. No temporary restraining
order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order shall have been issued
by any Governmental Entity, nor shall any other legal restraint or prohibition
preventing, restricting or which is reasonably likely to prevent or restrict the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, be in effect.

      Purchaser pursuant hereto or in connection with the negotiation, execution

      SECTION 9.03. METHOD OF ASSERTING CLAIMS, ETC.

            (a) In the event that any claim or demand for which any of Sellers
      would be liable to an Indemnified Purchaser Party hereunder is asserted
      against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Purchaser Party, the
      Indemnified Purchaser Party shall promptly deliver to Sellers a Claim
      Notice (including an estimated amount which shall not be conclusive of the
      final amount of such claim and demand). From and after Closing Purchaser
      shall also provide Sellers notice of RMA and FCIC compliance requests
      under the SRA that relate to any matter prior to the Closing Date promptly
      after receipt of such requests. Sellers shall have the Notice Period in
      which to notify the Indemnified Purchaser Party whether Sellers dispute
      their liability to the Indemnified Purchaser Party hereunder with respect
      to such claim or demand and, notwithstanding any such dispute, whether or
      not Sellers desire, at their sole cost and expense, to defend the
      Indemnified Purchaser Party against such claims or demand.

            (b) In the event Sellers notify the Indemnified Purchaser Party
      within the Notice Period that Sellers desire to defend the Indemnified
      Purchaser Party against such claim or demand then, except as hereinafter
      provided, Sellers shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Purchaser
      Party by appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly
      settled or prosecuted by them to a final conclusion in such a manner as to
      avoid any risk of Indemnified Purchaser Party becoming subject to
      liability for any other matter; provided, however, Sellers shall not,
      without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Purchaser Party,
      consent to the entry of any judgment against the Indemnified Purchaser
      Party or enter into any settlement or compromise which does not include
      complete, immediate, unconditional, general release by all claimants or
      plaintiffs


                                       71
<PAGE>

      of the Indemnified Purchaser Party, in form and substance satisfactory to
      the Indemnified Purchaser Party from all liability asserted or which could
      have been asserted in respect of such claim or litigation. If any
      Indemnified Purchaser Party desires to participate in, but not control,
      any such defense or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense.

            (c)(i) If Sellers elect not to defend the Indemnified Purchaser
      Party against such claim or demand, whether by not giving the Indemnified
      Purchaser Party timely notice as provided above or otherwise, Purchaser
      shall defend such claim or demand as if this Article IX did not apply. If
      the Sellers shall not have assumed the defense of such claim or demand,
      the Sellers shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
      settlement of such claims or demands effected without its written consent
      (unless such consent shall have been unreasonably withheld, in which case
      Sellers shall be liable to the same extent as if they had provided their
      written consent). The Sellers shall not admit any liability with respect
      to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such third party claim without the
      Indemnified Purchaser Party's prior written consent (which consent shall
      not be unreasonably withheld) unless (i) there is no finding or admission
      of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person and
      no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified
      Purchaser Party, or (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that
      are paid in full by the Sellers.

            (ii) In the event an Indemnified Purchaser Party should have a claim
      against Sellers hereunder that does not involve a claim or demand being
      asserted against or sought to be collected from it by a third party, the
      Indemnified Purchaser Party shall promptly send a Claim Notice with
      respect to such claim to Sellers. If Sellers do not notify the Indemnified
      Purchaser Party within the Notice Period that Sellers dispute such claim,
      the amount of such


                                       72
<PAGE>

      claim shall be conclusively deemed to be a liability of Sellers hereunder.

            (d) The indemnities provided in this Agreement shall survive the
      Closing but shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty
      terminates pursuant to Article VIII, except as to any item as to which the
      person to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the
      applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a Claim Notice
      (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the Sellers. The
      indemnity provided in this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive
      remedy of all Indemnified Purchaser Parties against the Sellers at law or
      equity for any matter covered by Article IX.

            (e) All claims for indemnification by an Indemnified Seller Party
      under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved under the procedures
      set forth above substituting in the appropriate place "Indemnified Seller
      Party" for "Indemnified Purchaser Party" and variations thereof and
      "Purchaser" for "Sellers."

      SECTION 9.04. PAYMENT

            (a) Upon the determination of the liability under Section 9.03
      hereof, the appropriate party shall pay to the other, as the case may be,
      within 10 days after such determination, the amount conclusively deemed to
      be a liability hereunder. Any indemnity amount conclusively deemed to be a
      liability under Section 9.03 hereof shall be reduced by an amount equal to
      any third party insurance proceeds realized by and paid to the indemnified
      party. The indemnified party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
      insurance claims relating to any claim for which it is seeking
      indemnification


                                       73
<PAGE>

      pursuant to Article IX; provided, that (i) the indemnified party shall not
      be obligated to make such an insurance claim if the indemnified party in
      its reasonable judgment believes that the cost of pursuing such an
      insurance claim together with any correspondent increase in insurance
      premiums or other chargebacks to the indemnified party would exceed the
      value of the claim for which the indemnified party is seeking
      indemnification pursuant to this Article IX and (ii) no indemnified party
      shall be required to keep or maintain any particular level of insurance.
      Upon the payment in full of any claim under this Article IX, the entity
      making payment shall be subrogated to the rights of the indemnified party
      against any person, firm or corporation with respect to the subject matter
      of such claim.

      SECTION 9.05. LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.

            (a) Sellers shall be liable for indemnification payments under
      Article IX of this Agreement only if the aggregate amount of all such
      damages, claims, losses, liabilities and expenses (other than damages,
      claims, losses, liabilities and expenses with respect to the title to the
      Business and the Transferred Assets) exceeds $100,000.00 and then only to
      the extent of such excess, subject to Section 9.05(d).

            (b) Sellers shall have no liability for indemnification payments
      under Article IX of this Agreement with respect to any claim or compliance
      matter arising from or relating in whole or in part to Insurance Contracts
      for the 2001 MPCI Crop Year, or any subsequent MPCI Crop Years, and acts,
      events or occurrences before Closing that is first asserted by RMA or
      FCIC, by request for information or otherwise, with respect to


                                       74
<PAGE>

      any reinsured claim closed more than thirty-nine months prior to the date
      of that first assertion.

            (c) Subject only to Section 9.05(d), the aggregate liability of
      Sellers for indemnification payments under this Article IX shall not
      exceed an amount equal to the sum of (i) Thirty-Six Million Four Hundred
      Thousand Dollars ($36,400,000) minus (ii) the aggregate amounts paid to
      the Purchaser pursuant to the indemnity provisions of the Granite Re
      Treaty.

            (d) None of the limitations set forth in Section 9.05 (a) or (c)
      shall apply with respect to an indemnification obligation for claims by or
      against Purchaser arising from or related to actual fraud committed by
      Sellers, Shareholders or any of them.

      SECTION 9.06. JOINT LIABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS IN RESPECT OF DIVIDENDS. In
the event that Sellers shall pay a dividend to SIG on or before the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, then SIG shall, to the extent of the dividend
(but not exceeding $12,400,000 less the aggregate amount paid towards the
indemnity obligations of Sellers by Goran pursuant to the next sentence)
received by it, be liable jointly and severally with the Sellers for any
indemnification claim that arises hereunder. In the event that SIG shall,
following receipt of a dividend from Sellers and before the third anniversary of
the Closing Date, pay a dividend to its shareholders, including Goran, then
Goran shall to the extent of the dividend it received from SIG (but not
exceeding $12,400,000 less the aggregate amount paid towards the indemnity
obligations of Sellers by SIG pursuant to the previous sentence) be liable
jointly and severally with the Sellers and SIG for indemnification hereunder.
