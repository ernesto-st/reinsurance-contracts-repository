In the case of a request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer:  (a) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (b) the amount thereof; (c) the expiry date thereof; (d) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (e) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (f) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder, (g) the relevant Approved Currency in which such Letter of Credit is to be denominated; and (h) such other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably request.  In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer:  (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably request.

In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Company of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof.  Not later than 1:00 p.m., on the first Business Day immediately following any payment by an L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit with written notice to the Borrower (each such date, an &#8220;Honor Date&#8221;), the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing in the relevant Approved Currency or in Dollars, as the case may be; provided that if such reimbursement is not made on the date the drawing is paid, the Borrower shall pay interest to the relevant L/C Issuer on such amount if in Dollars or, otherwise, in the Dollar Equivalent amount at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans (without duplication of interest payable on L/C Borrowings).  The applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower in writing of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination or revaluation thereof.

The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the relevant L/C Issuer. (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the relevant L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on written demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Appropriate Lender&#8217;s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.

For purposes hereof, &#8220;Cash Collateralize&#8221; means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant L/C Issuer and the Appropriate Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash, Cash Equivalents (if reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer) or deposit account balances (in each case, &#8220;Cash Collateral&#8221;) pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Appropriate Lenders).  Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings.  The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuers and the Revolving Credit Lenders of the applicable Facility, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.  Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked accounts at the Administrative Agent and may be invested in readily available Cash Equivalents (for the benefit of the Borrower).  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are expressly subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) or nonconsensual liens permitted under Section 7.01 or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, the Borrower will, promptly following written demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the deposit accounts at the Administrative Agent as aforesaid, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim.

To the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds the then Outstanding Amount of such L/C Obligations and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower.  To the extent any Event of Default giving rise to the requirement to Cash Collateralize any Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.03(g) is cured or otherwise waived by the Required Lenders, then so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all Cash Collateral pledged to Cash Collateralize such Letter of Credit shall be promptly refunded to the applicable depositor of Cash Collateral.  If at any time the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided or Liens described above, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly following written demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.  In addition, the Administrative Agent may request at any time and from time to time after the initial deposit of Cash Collateral that additional Cash Collateral be provided by the Borrower in order to protect against the results of exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in currencies other than Dollars and the fluctuating value of any Cash Equivalents. Letter of Credit Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each(h) Revolving Credit Lender for the applicable Revolving Credit Facility in accordance with its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement) a Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit if such maximum amount increases periodically pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit); provided that (x) if any portion of a Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit is Cash Collateralized by the Borrower or reallocated to the other Revolving Credit Lenders pursuant to Section 2.17(a)(iv), then the Borrower shall not be required to pay a Letter of Credit fee to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such portion of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share so long as it is Cash Collateralized by the Borrower or reallocated to the other Revolving Credit Lenders, but to the extent such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share is reallocated to the other Revolving Credit Lenders pursuant to Section 2.17(a)(iv) such Letter of Credit fee shall instead be payable to such other Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share of such reallocated amount, and (y) if any portion of a Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share is not Cash Collateralized or reallocated pursuant to Section 2.17(a)(iv), then the Letter of Credit fee with respect to such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share shall be payable to the applicable L/C Issuer until such Pro Rata Share is Cash Collateralized or reallocated or such Lender ceases to be a Defaulting Lender.

Addition of an L/C Issuer.

A written notice (including documentation reasonably supporting such request) of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers hereby irrevocably appoints Goldman Sachs Bank USA to(a) act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental or related thereto.  The provisions of this Article IX (other than Sections 9.01, 9.06 and 9.09 through and including 9.12) are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, and no Loan Party has rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; as used herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. The Administrative Agent shall also act as the &#8220;collateral agent&#8221; under the Loan Documents, and(b) each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Hedge Bank) and the L/C Issuers hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender and L/C Issuer for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.  In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as &#8220;collateral agent&#8221; and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article IX and Article X (including the second paragraph of Section 10.05), as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the &#8220;collateral agent&#8221; under the Loan Documents as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lenders hereby expressly authorize the Administrative Agent to (i) execute any and all documents (including releases and Intercreditor Agreements) with respect to the Collateral (including any amendment, supplement, modification or joinder with respect thereto) and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto, as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Collateral Documents and acknowledge and agree that any such action by any Agent shall bind the Lenders and (ii) negotiate, enforce or settle any claim, action or proceeding affecting the Lenders in their capacity as such, at the direction of the Required Lenders, which negotiation, enforcement or settlement will be binding upon each Lender.  For the avoidance of doubt the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to enter into any Intercreditor Agreement it believes reasonable. Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall haveSection 9.02. the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term &#8220;Lender&#8221; or &#8220;Lenders&#8221; shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. Exculpatory Provisions.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties orSection 9.03. obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; -171- </FONT></DIV>

In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance, extension or increase of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

Each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, at its option, and in its sole discretion: (a) to enter into and sign for and on behalf of the Lenders as Secured Parties the Collateral Documents for the benefit of the Lenders and the other Secured Parties; (b) to automatically release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Secured Obligations (other than Cash Management Obligations, Obligations not yet due and payable in respect of Secured Hedge Agreements, contingent obligations not yet due and Cash Collateralized or backstopped Letters of Credit) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit which have been Cash Collateralized or as to which other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuers shall have been made), (ii) at the time the property subject to such Lien is sold or transferred or to be sold or transferred as part of or in connection with any Disposition to a non-Loan Party permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (iii) subject to Section 10.01, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders or (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guaranty pursuant to Section 9.10(d); (c) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to another Lien (i) permitted to exist on such property and (ii) expressly permitted to be senior to the Liens of the Secured Parties under this Agreement; and (d) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a transaction or designation permitted hereunder; provided that no such release shall occur if such Guarantor continues to be a guarantor in respect of any Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness, any Junior Financing or any Indebtedness incurred under Section 7.03(v).

In each case as specified in this Section 9.10, the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower&#8217;s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.10.

Withholding Tax Indemnity.  To the extent required by any applicable Laws, theSection 9.12. Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective or if any payment has been made by the Administrative Agent to any Lender without applicable withholding tax being deducted from such payment), such Lender shall, within 10 days after written demand therefor, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01 and 3.04 and without limiting or expanding the obligation of the Borrower to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.12.  The agreements in this Section 9.12 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) an SPC shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and the limitations of such Section), but neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement except, in the case of Section  3.01, to the extent that the grant to the SPC was made with the prior written consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall have reasonable basis for withholding consent if an exercise by SPC immediately after the grant would result in materially increased -187- </FONT></DIV>
