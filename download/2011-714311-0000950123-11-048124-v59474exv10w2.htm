information concerning the Obligors or their Affiliates (including information concerning the

certain suretyship rights and defenses are available to a party that encumbers its property
to secure the obligations of another.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n) We call to your attention that a security interest of the Collateral
Agent in any Collateral constituting &#147;payment intangibles&#148;, &#147;general intangibles&#148; or
&#147;accounts&#148; (as such terms are defined in Article&nbsp;9 of the NYUCC) may be subject to the
rights, claims and defenses of account debtors and the terms of agreements with account
debtors. In the case of any Collateral which is itself secured by other property, we
express no opinion with respect to the Collateral Agent&#146;s rights in and to such underlying
property.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(o) Our opinion set forth in paragraphs 4 and 6 above is subject to the
further qualification that: (i)&nbsp;in the case of proceeds, the Collateral Agent&#146;s security
interest is limited as provided in Sections&nbsp;9-315 and 9-322 of the NYUCC; and (ii)&nbsp;Section
552 of the Bankruptcy Code limits (subject to the exceptions set forth therein) the extent
to which property acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy
Code may be subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement entered into by
the debtor before the commencement of such case.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(p) In rendering our opinion set forth in paragraph 4 above, we have assumed
that value has been given to each Obligor party to the Security Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(q) In the case of Collateral in which the security interest of the
Collateral Agent has been perfected by the filing of a Financing Statement, Article&nbsp;9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code requires the filing of continuation statements within the period of
six months prior to the expiration of five years from the date of the original filings in
order to maintain the effectiveness of such filings. We express no opinion as to whether
the description of the collateral contained in the Security Documents or any UCC financing
statements is sufficient within the meaning of Sections&nbsp;9-108 and 9-504 of the NYUCC and we
assume that the information set forth in each UCC financing statement is correct. We also
express no opinion whether or to what extent a financing statement will be effective to
perfect a security interest in assets outside of the United States.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(r) We express no opinion as to any provision of any Transaction Document
that provides for waiver of trial by jury or of other rights or defenses that under
applicable law (including judicial decisions) or public policy cannot be waived.
