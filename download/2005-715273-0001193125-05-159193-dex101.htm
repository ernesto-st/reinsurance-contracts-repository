during the CL Availability Period, and (ii) RF Letters of Credit, at any time and from time to time during the RF Availability Period, in each case for the Borrower&#146;s own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and
the applicable Issuing Bank. For purposes hereof, (i) Letters of Credit shall at all times and from time to time be deemed to be CL Letters of Credit in the amount specified in the definition of CL Letters of Credit and be deemed to be RF Letters of
Credit only to the extent, and in an amount by which, the aggregate amount of outstanding Letters of Credit exceeds such amount specified in the definition of CL Letters of Credit, (ii) drawings under any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to have
been made under RF Letters of Credit for so long as, and to the extent that, there are any undrawn RF Letters of Credit outstanding (and thereafter shall be deemed to have been made under CL Letters of Credit) and (iii) any Letter of Credit that
expires or terminates will be deemed to be a RF Letter of Credit, for so long as, and to the extent that, there are outstanding RF Letters of Credit immediately prior to such expiration or termination, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, at any
time during which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (A) outstanding Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be RF Letters of Credit and CL Letters of Credit, (B) drawings under Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been
made under RF Letters of Credit and CL Letters of Credit and (C) any Letter of Credit that expires or terminates shall be deemed to be a RF Letter of Credit and a CL Letter of Credit, in each case <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> based upon (1) RF LC
Availability and (2) the Adjusted Credit-Linked Amount. To the extent necessary to implement the foregoing, the identification of a Letter of Credit as a RF Letter of Credit or a CL Letter of Credit may change from time to time and a portion of a
Letter of Credit may be deemed to be a CL Letter of Credit and the remainder be deemed to be a RF Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the entire face amount of any Letter of Credit with an expiration date after the Revolving Loan
Maturity Date shall at all times be deemed to be a CL Letter of Credit, subject to the limitations set forth in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
