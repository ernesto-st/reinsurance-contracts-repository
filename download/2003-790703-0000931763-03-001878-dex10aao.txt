     (b) simultaneously with the Closing Date, but immediately prior to giving
     effect to Section 1.01(e), those Lenders party to the Existing Credit
     Agreement whose Commitment is being terminated or decreased shall be deemed
     to have assigned, without recourse, to Lenders increasing their Commitment
     such portion of the terminating or decreasing Lender's Loans and Pro Rata
     Shares of Outstanding Amounts of L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans as
     shall be necessary to effectuate the adjustments in Commitments, Loans and
     Pro Rata Shares, with the resulting Commitment allocations on

     the Closing Date being as set forth in Schedule 2.01 hereto, with
     respective Outstanding Amounts of Committed Loans and Pro Rate shares of
     the Outstanding Amounts of L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loan as
     registered by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the administration of
     the Credit Agreement.

          (c) The parties hereby consent to all reallocations and assignments of
     Commitments and Outstanding Amounts effected pursuant to Sections 1.01(b)
     and 1.01(c) and subject to Article V hereof, waive any requirement for any
     other document or instrument, including any Assignment and Acceptance under
     the Existing Credit Facility or Assignment and Assumption hereunder,
     necessary to give effect to any reallocation or assignment, which shall be
     deemed effective as if such reallocation or assignment were evidenced by
     applicable Assignments and Acceptances under the Existing Credit Agreement
     or Assignments and Assumptions hereunder. On the Closing Date the Lenders
     shall make full cash settlement with each other (and with the Lenders under
     the Existing Credit Agreement whose Commitments are being terminated)
     either directly or through the Administrative Agent, as the Administrative
     Agent may direct or approve, with respect to all assignments and
     reallocations in Commitments as reflected in this Section 1.01 such that
     after giving effect to such settlements each Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
     Aggregate Commitments equals (with customary rounding) its Pro Rata Share
     of (a) the Outstanding Amount of all Committed Loans, (b) the Outstanding
     Amount of all L/C Obligations, and (c) the Outstanding Amount of all Swing
     Line Loans.

          (d) The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby
     agree that upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, the terms and
     provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement which in any manner govern or
     evidence the obligations arising hereunder, the rights and interests of the
     Agent and the Lenders and any terms, conditions or matters related to any
     thereof, shall be and hereby are amended and restated in their entirety by
     the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, and the terms and
     provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement, except as otherwise expressly
     provided herein, shall be superseded by this Agreement.

          (e) Notwithstanding this amendment and restatement of the Existing
     Credit Agreement, including anything in this Section 1.01, and of any
     related "Loan Document" (as such term is defined in the Existing Credit
     Agreement and referred to herein, individually or collectively, as the
     "Existing Loan Documents"), (i) all of the indebtedness, liabilities and
     obligations owing by the Borrower or any other Person under the Existing
     Credit Agreement and other Existing Loan Documents shall continue as

a historical pro forma basis pursuant to Section 1.12(a) above shall be
disregarded.

                                   ARTICLE II.
                      THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS

     2.01 Committed Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Committed Loan")
to the Borrower in Dollars or in one or more Alternative Currencies from time to
time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period, in an aggregate amount
at any time outstanding for which the Dollar Equivalent Amount does not exceed
the amount of such Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that after giving
effect to any Committed Borrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed
the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the
Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's
Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, and subject to the
other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section
2.01, repay, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01.
Committed Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as further
provided herein.

     2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Committed Loans.

     (a) Each Committed Borrowing, each conversion of Committed Loans from one
Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be
made upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which
may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 8:00 a.m. (i) three Business Days prior to
the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or of any conversion of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Committed Loans, and
(ii) four Business Days (or five Business Days in the case of a Special Notice
Currency) prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, and (iii) on the
requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans. Each telephonic
notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(b) must be confirmed
promptly by delivery

                                       32

<PAGE>

to the Administrative Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing
of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars shall be
in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof. Each Borrowing of, or conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency
Rate Loans in Alternative Currencies shall be in a minimum principal Dollar
Equivalent amount of $5,000,000. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and
2.04(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Committed Loans shall be
in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall
specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Committed Borrowing, a
conversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or
continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the
principal amount of Committed Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv)
the Type of Committed Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Committed Loans
are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with
respect thereto, and (vi) the currency of the Committed Loans to be borrowed;
provided, however, that if as of the date of any Committed Loan Notice
requesting a Committed Borrowing, there are Swing Line Loans and/or L/C
Borrowings outstanding, the Applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested that a portion of the requested Committed Loans in a principal amount
equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line Loans and L/C
Borrowings be denominated in the respective currencies of such Swing Line Loans
and L/C Borrowings. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in
a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice
requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans
shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans; provided, however, that in
the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Committed Loans
denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Loans shall be continued as
Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their original currency with an Interest Period of
one month. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or automatic
continuation to additional one-month Interest Periods shall be effective as of
the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the
applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of,
conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such Committed
Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have
specified an Interest Period of one month. No Committed Loan may be converted
into or continued as a Committed Loan denominated in a different currency, but
instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in
the other currency.

     (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the
applicable Committed Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or
continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or
continuation of Committed Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, in each
case as described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Committed
Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Committed Loan available to
the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent's Office
for the applicable currency not later than 10:00 a.m. in the case of any
Committed Loan denominated in Dollars, and not later than the Applicable Time
specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Committed Loan
denominated in an Alternative Currency, in each case on the Business Day
specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in

                                       33

<PAGE>

Section 5.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section
5.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to
the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i)
crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the
amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in
accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the
Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date
the Committed Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by the
Borrower, there are Swing Line Loans or L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the
proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full of
any such L/C Borrowings, second, to the payment in full of any such Swing Line
Loans, and third, to the Borrower as provided above.

     (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be
continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurocurrency Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be
requested as, converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans without the
consent of the Required Lenders; and the Required Lenders may demand that any or
all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an
Alternative Currency be prepaid on the last day of the then current Interest
Period with respect thereto.

     (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency
Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the
Eurocurrency Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in
Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly
following the public announcement of such change.

     (e) After giving effect to all Committed Borrowings, all conversions of
Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Committed
Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in
effect with respect to Committed Loans.

     (f) The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan on any date shall
not relieve any other Lender of any obligation to make a Committed Loan on such
date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to
so make its Committed Loan.

     2.03 Letters of Credit.

     (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment.

          (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C
     Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set
     forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day
     during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit
     Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or one
     or more Alternative Currencies for the account of the Borrower, and to
     amend or renew Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance
     with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drafts under the Letters of
     Credit; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of
     Credit issued for the account of the Borrower; provided that the

                                       34

<PAGE>

     L/C Issuer shall not be obligated to make any L/C Credit Extension with
     respect to any Letter of Credit, and no Lender shall be obligated to
     participate in any Letter of Credit if as of the date of such L/C Credit
     Extension, (x) the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate
     Commitments, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of
     any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of
     all L/C Obligations, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding
     Amount of all Swing Line Loans would exceed such Lender's Commitment, or
     (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed the Letter
     of Credit Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms
     and conditions hereof, the Borrower's ability to obtain Letters of Credit
     shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the
     foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit
     that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing
     Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and
     from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the
     terms and conditions hereof.

          (ii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter
     of Credit if:

               (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority
          or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C
          Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to
          the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the
          force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
          the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain
          from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of
          Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect
          to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital
          requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated
          hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the
          L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
          applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith
          deems material to it;

               (B) subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of such
          requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after
          the date of issuance or last renewal, unless the Required Lenders have
          approved such expiry date;

               (C) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would
          occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the
          Lenders have approved such expiry date;

               (D) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or
          more policies of the L/C Issuer; or

               (E) such Letter of Credit is in an initial Dollar Equivalent
          amount less than $100,000, or is to be denominated in a currency other
          than Dollars or an Alternative Currency.

          (iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter
     of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to
     issue such Letter of Credit

                                       35

<PAGE>

     in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such
     Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of
     Credit.

     (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit;
Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.

          (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may
     be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a
     copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit
     Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of
     the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C
     Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 8:00 a.m. at least two
     Business Days (or such later date and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a
     particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance
     date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for
     an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
     Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C
     Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit
     (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency thereof; (C)
     the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary
     thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of
     any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be
     presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G)
     such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request
     for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
     Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer
     (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment
     thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed
     amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.

          (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the
     L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
     writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter
     of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will
     provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Upon receipt by the
     L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested
     issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof,
     then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on
     the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the
     Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in
     each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business
     practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
     Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
     agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter
     of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata Share
     times the amount of such Letter of Credit.

          (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit
     Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree
     to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an
     "Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit"); provided that any such Auto-Renewal
     Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at
     least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of
     issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the
     beneficiary

                                       36

<PAGE>

     thereof not later than a day (the "Nonrenewal Notice Date") in each such
     twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is
     issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not
     be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such
     renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders
     shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to
     permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date
     not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however,
     that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such renewal if (A) the L/C Issuer
     has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such
     Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of
     the provisions of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received
     notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that
     is five Business Days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date (1) from the
     Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit
     such renewal or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the
     Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section
     5.02 is not then satisfied.

          (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any
     amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or
     to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the
     Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such
     Letter of Credit or amendment. Upon receipt of such copy, the
     Administrative Agent shall make good faith efforts to notify each Lender of
     such Letter of Credit or amendment, provided, however, that the
     Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability for its failure to do
     so.

     (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

          (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any
     notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall
     notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than
     8:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of
     Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the Borrower shall reimburse the
     L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the
     amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. If the Borrower
     fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent
     shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the
     unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount of such
     Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In the case of any Letter of Credit
     denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Unreimbursed Amount shall be
     redenominated into Dollars and equal the Dollar Equivalent Amount thereof,
     and the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Lenders in the notice
     described in the preceding sentence. In the event of an unreimbursed
     drawing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed
     Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount
     equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and
     multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate
     Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate
     Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than the
     delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or
     the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given
     by telephone if

                                       37

<PAGE>

     immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an
     immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding
     effect of such notice.

          (ii) Each Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C Issuer) shall
     upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the
     Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the
     Administrative Agent's Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount
     equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 10:00
     a.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative
     Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each
     Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base
     Rate Committed Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative
     Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.

          (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully
     refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the
     conditions set forth in Section 5.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other
     reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer
     an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so
     refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand
     (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In
     such event, each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed
     payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
     constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its
     participation obligation under this Section 2.03.

          (iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance
     pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount
     drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Pro
     Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C
     Issuer.

          (v) Each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances
     to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as
     contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional
     and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off,
     counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
     against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason
     whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any
     other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the
     foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make
     Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the
     conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower
     of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve
     or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C
     Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any
     Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

          (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent
     for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such
     Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the
     time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to
     recover from such Lender (acting through the

                                       38

<PAGE>

     Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the
     period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such
     payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum
     equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate
     of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative
     Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be
     conclusive absent manifest error.

     (d)  Repayment of Participations.

          (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any
     Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance
     in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the
     Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment
     in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether
     directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash
     Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative
     Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof
     (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the
     period of time during which such Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in
     the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.

          (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be
     returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06
     (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its
     discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the
     Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to
     the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal
     to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.

     (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the
L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C
Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances,
including the following:

          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit,
     this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

          (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off, defense or
     other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary
     or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such
     beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any
     other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
     contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or
     instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

          (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under
     such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
     insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
     inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the

                                       39

<PAGE>

     transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a
     drawing under such Letter of Credit;

          (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against
     presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with
     the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer
     under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in
     bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
     liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any
     beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any
     arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

          (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
     similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that
     might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the
     Borrower.

The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each
amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of
noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the
Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

     (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying
any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any
responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates
and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or
inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of
the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer,
any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants
or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action
taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of
the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or
omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the
due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or
instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The
Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or
transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however,
that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower's
pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or
transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, any
Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or
assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the
matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e); provided,
however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be
liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as
opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which
the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful misconduct or gross
negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit
after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of
Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer
may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of

                                       40

<PAGE>

any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights
or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove
to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

     (g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if
the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter
of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of
the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit may for any reason
remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall
immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C
Obligations (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Outstanding
Amount determined as of the date of such L/C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit
Expiration Date, as the case may be). The Administrative Agent may, at any time
and from time to time after the initial deposit of Cash Collateral, request that
additional Cash Collateral be provided in order to protect against the results
of exchange rate fluctuations; and, upon such request, the Borrower shall
immediately provide such additional Cash Collateral. For purposes hereof, "Cash
Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative
Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the
L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances (collectively, "Cash
Collateral"), pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby
consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding
meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash,
deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.
Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit
accounts at Bank of America.

     (h) Applicability of ISP98. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C
Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such
agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the
"International Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of
International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in
effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit.

     (i) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a
Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate
times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit
(whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such Letter of
Credit); provided, however, that while any Event of Default exists, the Borrower
shall pay a Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit equal to the Default
Rate times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect). Such letter of
credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such letter of
credit fees shall be due and payable on the first Business Day of each February,
May, August and November, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and
thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any
quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and
multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter
that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

                                       41

<PAGE>

     (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C
Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a
fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to 0.125%
per annum times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily maximum amount available to
be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then
in effect under such Letter of Credit). Such fronting fee shall be due and
payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each February, May,
August and November, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
issuance of such Letter of Credit, and on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date.
In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own
account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing
fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to
letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and
standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

     (k) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of any
conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

     2.04 Swing Line Loans.

     (a) The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans in Dollars (each such loan, a "Swing
Line Loan") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the
Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding
the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing
Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of
Committed Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender,
may exceed the amount of such Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that after
giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not
exceed the Aggregate Commitments and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of
the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's
Commitment, and provided, further, that the Borrower shall not use the proceeds
of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the
foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and
reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate
Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be
deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from
the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount
equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such
Swing Line Loan.

     (b) Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the
Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative
Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the
Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. on the
requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which
shall be a minimum of $250,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which
shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly
by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written
Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
Officer

                                       42

<PAGE>

of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any
telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the
Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent
has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender
will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the
contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone
or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any
Lender) prior to 11:00 a.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A)
directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of
the limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of Section
2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Article V is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 12:00 noon on the borrowing
date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line
Loan available to the Borrower.

     (c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.

          (i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute
     discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably
     authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each
     Lender make a Base Rate Committed Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's
     Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such
     request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to
     be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the
     requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples
     specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject
     to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions
     set forth in Section 5.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower
     with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after
     delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make
     an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such
     Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately
     available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the
     Administrative Agent's Office not later than 10:00 a.m. on the day
     specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section
     2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to
     have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The
     Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line
     Lender.

          (ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by
     such a Committed Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the
     request for Base Rate Committed Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as
     set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender
     that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing
     Line Loan and each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be
     deemed payment in respect of such participation.

          (iii) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative
     Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be
     paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section
     2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender
     shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
     Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon

                                       43

<PAGE>

     for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which
     such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate
     per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A
     certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the
     Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause
     (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          (iv) Each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans or to purchase
     and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section
     2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
     any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
     defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line
     Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the
     occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event
     or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided,
     however, that each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to
     this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section
     5.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise
     impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together
     with interest as provided herein.

     (d) Repayment of Participations.

          (i) At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk
     participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any
     payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will
     distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment (appropriately
     adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time
     during which such Lender's risk participation was funded) in the same funds
     as those received by the Swing Line Lender.

          (ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of
     principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by
     the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section
     11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line
     Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender
     its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus
     interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is
     returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The
     Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing
     Line Lender.

     (e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall
be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans.
Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Committed Loan or risk participation
pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any
Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for
the account of the Swing Line Lender.

     (f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all
payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans in Dollars
and directly to the Swing Line Lender.

                                       44

     2.05 Prepayments.

     (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time
or from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed Loans in whole or in part
without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by
the Administrative Agent not later than 8:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior
to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (B) four Business Days (or
five, in the case of prepayment of Loans denominated in Special Notice
Currencies) prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans
denominated in Alternative Currencies, and (C) on the date of prepayment of Base
Rate Committed Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated
in Dollars shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof; (iii) any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans
denominated in Alternative Currencies shall be in a minimum Dollar Equivalent
principal amount of $5,000,000; and (iv) any prepayment of Base Rate Committed
Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal
amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and
amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each
such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate
Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any
additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall
be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares.

     (b) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay
Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that
(i) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative
Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (ii) any such
prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $250,000. Each such notice
shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by
the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.

     (c) If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the
Aggregate Commitments then in effect (or the Outstanding Amount of L/C
Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit), the Borrower shall
immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an
aggregate amount sufficient to reduce the Total Outstandings to an amount not to
exceed the aggregate Commitments then in effect (or, as applicable, to reduce
the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations to an amount not to exceed the Letter
of Credit Sublimit); provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required
to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(c)
unless after the prepayment in full of the Committed Loans and Swing Line Loans
the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect (or the
Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit then
in effect). The Administrative Agent may, at any time and from time to time
after the initial deposit of such Cash Collateral, request that additional Cash
Collateral be provided in order to protect against the result of further
exchange rate fluctuations; and, upon

                                       45

<PAGE>

such request, the Borrower shall immediately deliver such additional Cash
Collateral to the Administrative Agent.

     2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Borrower may, upon notice
to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time
to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such
notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 8:00 a.m.
five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such
partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate
or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any
concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the
Aggregate Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the
Aggregate Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit
exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitments, each such sublimit, as
applicable, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of
termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the
Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender
according to its Pro Rata Share. All facility fees and utilization fees accrued
until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall
be paid on the effective date of such termination.

     2.07 Repayment of Loans.

     (a) The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders in the applicable currency on
the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans outstanding
on such date.

     (b) The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan in Dollars on the earlier
to occur of (i) demand by the Swing Line Lender for repayment and (ii) the
Maturity Date.

     2.08 Interest.

     (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate
Committed Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof
from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on
the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

     (b) If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not
paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear
interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Furthermore,
while any Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the
principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating
interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued

                                       46

<PAGE>

and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due
interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.

     (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

     2.09 Fees. In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i) and (j)
of Section 2.03:

     (a) Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a facility fee
equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate
Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the
Outstanding Amount of all Committed Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C
Obligations), regardless of usage. The facility fee shall accrue at all times
during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Committed Loans,
Swing Line Loans or L/C Obligations remain outstanding), including at any time
during which one or more of the conditions in Article V is not met, and shall be
due and payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each February,
May, August and November, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on
demand). The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there
is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount
shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each
period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

     (b) Utilization Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a utilization
fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the Total Outstandings on each day that
the Total Outstandings exceed 50% of the actual daily amount of the Aggregate
Commitments. The utilization fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears
on the first Business Day of each February, May, August and November, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the Maturity
Date. The utilization fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears and if there
is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount shall
be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate for each period during which
such Applicable Rate was in effect. The utilization fee shall accrue at all
times, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in
Article V is not met.

     (c) Other Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the
     Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts
     and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully
     earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

          (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have
     been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so
     specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be
     refundable for any reason whatsoever.

                                       47

<PAGE>

     2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for
Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America's "prime
rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall
be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in
more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis
of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the
Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the
day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is
repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a),
bear interest for one day.

     2.11 Evidence of Debt.

     (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or
more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative
Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by
the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest
error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower
and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in
doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the
Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In
the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any
Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of
such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control
in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through
the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender
(through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's
Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules
to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and
maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

     (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a),
each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such
Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event
of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of
such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control
in the absence of manifest error.

     2.12 Payments Generally.

     (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition
or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and
interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the
Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative
Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than
11:00 a.m. on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all payments by any Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and
interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the
Administrative Agent, for the

                                       48

<PAGE>

account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the
applicable Administrative Agent's Office in such Alternative Currency and in
Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the
Administrative Agent on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will
promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share
as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer
to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative
Agent (i) after 11:00 a.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) later
than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of
payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on
the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall
continue to accrue.

     (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other
than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day,
and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as
the case may be.

     (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative
Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the
Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case
may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and
may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a
corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that
such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds,
then:

          (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall
     forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such
     assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds,
     together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including
     the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such
     Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in
     Same Day Funds at the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in
     effect; and

          (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall
     forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in
     Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date
     such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower
     to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the
     "Compensation Period") at a rate per annum equal to the applicable
     Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount
     to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
     Lender's Committed Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such
     Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's
     demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon
     the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative
     Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate
     per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable
     Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its
     obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the
     Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a
     result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

                                       49

<PAGE>

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect
to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error.

     (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any
Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this
Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension
set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as
received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

     (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans and to
fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and
not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan or to fund any
such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other
Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its
Committed Loan or purchase its participation.

     (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the
funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a
representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

     2.13 Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere
herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Committed Loans made by it, or
the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it, any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share
contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Committed Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations
in the participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as
the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share
the excess payment in respect of such Committed Loans or such participations, as
the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or
any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing
Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its
discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor,
together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according
to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment
to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any
interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of
the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 11.09) with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep
records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error)
of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the
Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a
participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have
the right to give all notices, requests, demands,

                                       50

<PAGE>

directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the
portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing
Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

     2.14 Increase in Commitments.

     (a) Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative
Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrower may from time to
time, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an amount (for all
such requests) not exceeding $150,000,000. At the time of sending such notice,
the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the
time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no
event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to
the Lenders). Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time
period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether
by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such
requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be
deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders' responses to each
request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase, the
Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders
pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and its counsel.

     (b) If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this
Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective
date (the "Increase Effective Date") and the final allocation of such increase.
The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of
the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date. As a
condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase
Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible
Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted
by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the
case of the Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such
increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article VI and the
other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective
Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically
refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such
earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.15, the
representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section
6.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant
to subsections (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 7.01, and (B) no Default
exists. The Borrower shall prepay any Committed Loans outstanding on the
Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Committed Loans
ratable with any revised Pro Rata Shares arising from any nonratable increase in
the Commitments under this Section.

     (c) This Section shall supersede any provisions in Sections 2.13 or 11.01
to the contrary.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

     3.01 Taxes.

     (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar
charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its
overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income
taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the
Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is
organized or maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges,
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall
be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority
in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of
such payment, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which
shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof.

     (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future
stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or
charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan
Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

     (c) If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or Other
Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the
Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest
is paid, such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender
specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all
taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been imposed.

     (d) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (ii) amounts
payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including additions to
tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment
under this subsection (d) shall be

                                       52

<PAGE>

made within 30 days after the date the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes
a demand therefor.

     3.02 Illegality. If any Lender (or, in the case of Letters of Credit, the
L/C Issuer) determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender (or such
L/C Issuer) or its applicable Lending Office to issue, make, maintain or fund
Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative
Currency (the "Applicable Currency")) or Letters of Credit denominated in the
Applicable Currency, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material
restrictions on the authority of such Lender (or such L/C Issuer) to purchase or
sell, or to take deposits of, any Applicable Currency in the applicable
interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender (or L/C Issuer) to the
Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender (or L/C
Issuer) to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or to issue Letters of
Credit, as applicable) in the Applicable Currency or, if the Applicable Currency
is Dollars, to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans
shall be suspended until such Lender (or L/C Issuer) notifies the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination
no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand
from such Lender (or L/C Issuer) (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
prepay all such Eurocurrency Loans or, if applicable and such Loans are
denominated in Dollars, convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender
to Base Rate Loans, in either case either on the last day of the Interest Period
therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency
Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue
to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or
conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount of any
Loan so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will
not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

     3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. (a) If the Required Lenders (or, in the
case of Letters of Credit, the L/C Issuer) determine that for any reason (i)
deposits in an Applicable Currency are not being offered to banks in the
applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount
and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (ii) adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested
Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (iii) the
Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a
proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost
to such Lenders of funding such Loan, or (iv) with respect to any Applicable
Currency, there shall have occurred any change in international financial,
political or economic conditions (including the imposition of or any change in
exchange controls) or currency exchange rates which would make it impractical to
make Loans or to issue Letters of Credit denominated in the Applicable Currency,
then the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each
Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders (or such L/C Issuer, as
applicable) to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or to issue Letters of
Credit, as applicable) in the Applicable Currency shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders or L/C
Issuer, as applicable) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of

                                       53

<PAGE>

Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or issuance of Letters of Credit) in the Applicable
Currency or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a
request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (or issuance of Letters of
Credit, as applicable) in the Dollar Equivalent amount specified therein.

     (b) If any Mandatory Cost Reference Lender's Commitment shall terminate
(otherwise than on termination of the Aggregate Commitments), or for any reason
whatsoever any Mandatory Cost Reference Lender shall cease to be a Lender
hereunder, such Mandatory Cost Reference Lender shall thereupon cease to be a
Mandatory Cost Reference Lender, and, when necessary, the Mandatory Cost Rate
shall be determined on the basis of the rates as notified by the remaining
Mandatory Cost Reference Lenders in accordance with Schedule 1.02-B, or if there
is no remaining Mandatory Cost Reference Lender that is a Lender, the
Administrative Agent shall designate one or more replacement Mandatory Cost
Reference Lenders from among the Lenders.

     3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy.

     (a) If any Lender (or, in the case of Letters of Credit, the L/C Issuer)
determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's compliance therewith, there shall be
any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding
or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or
participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or
receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for
purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount
resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.01 shall govern),
(ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross
income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political
subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized
or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements utilized in the
determination of the Eurocurrency Rate, then from time to time upon demand of
such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate
such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

     (b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding
capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, or
compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of
reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder
(taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and
such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of
such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate
such Lender for such reduction.

     3.05 Funding Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate
such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense
incurred by it as a result of:

                                       54

<PAGE>

     (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other
than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period
for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of
acceleration, or otherwise); or

     (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of
such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the
Borrower; or

     (c) any failure by the Applicable Borrower to make payment of any Loan or
drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an
Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a
different currency;

including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any
loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained
by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from
which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary
administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

     For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders
under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each
Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Base Rate used in
determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other
borrowing in the applicable offshore interbank eurocurrency market for such
currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not
such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

     3.06 Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation. A certificate of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article
III and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining
such amount, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

     3.07 Survival. All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article III
shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all
other Obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV.
                                    SECURITY

     4.01 Facility Guaranty; Pledge Agreement.

     (a) As security for the full and timely payment and performance of all
Obligations, Borrower shall on or before the Closing Date do or cause to be done
all things necessary to cause each Domestic Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary (other than Tech Data Finance SPV) to execute and deliver to
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders a Facility Guaranty and
shall further cause each Person who thereafter becomes a Domestic Subsidiary
that is a Significant Subsidiary to do all those things required by Section 7.13
hereof.

                                       55

<PAGE>

     (b) As security for the full and timely payment and performance of (i) all
Obligations now existing or hereafter arising and (ii) if applicable, all
obligations of Guarantors under the Facility Guaranty, Borrower shall, and shall
cause each Domestic Subsidiary to, on or before the Closing Date deliver to
Collateral Agent, the Pledge Agreement which shall pledge to Collateral Agent
for the benefit of the Secured Parties, the Pledged Interests in each Direct
Foreign Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary as are owned by Borrower or
any Domestic Subsidiary and shall take such further action and deliver or cause
to be delivered such further documents as required by the Pledge Agreement or
otherwise as Collateral Agent may reasonably request to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Article IV.

     4.02 Further Assurances. At the request of the Collateral Agent or the
Administrative Agent from time to time, the Borrower will or will cause all
other Loan Parties, as the case may be, to execute, by their respective
Responsible Officers, alone or with the Collateral Agent, any certificate,
instrument, financing statement, control agreement, statement or document, or to
procure any such certificate, instrument, statement or document, or to take such
other action (and pay all connected costs) which the Collateral Agent or the
Administrative Agent reasonably deems necessary from time to time to create,
continue or preserve the Liens in Collateral (and the perfection and priority
thereof) of the Collateral Agent contemplated hereby and by the other Loan
Documents and specifically including all Collateral acquired by the Borrower or
any other Loan Party after the Closing Date and all Collateral moved to or from
time to time located at locations owned by third parties, including without
limitation all leased locations, bailees, warehousemen and third party
processors. The Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to execute and
file or cause to be filed, with or if permitted by applicable law without the
signature of the Borrower or any Loan Party appearing thereon, all Uniform
Commercial Code financing statements reflecting the Borrower or any other Loan
Party as "debtor" and the Collateral Agent as "secured party", and continuations
thereof and amendments thereto, as the Collateral Agent reasonably deems
necessary or advisable to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Article IV and by the Pledge Agreement.

     4.03 Information Regarding Collateral. The Borrower represents and warrants
as of the Closing Date and covenants that: (i) each exact legal name, type of
organization, jurisdiction of formation and chief executive office of the
Borrower and each other Person providing Collateral pursuant to the Pledge
Agreement (each, a "Grantor") at the Closing Date, (ii) the exact organizational
identification number of each Grantor at the Closing Date, (iii) each exact
legal name, type of organization, jurisdiction of formation, and chief executive
office of each Direct Foreign Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary at the
Closing Date, and (iv) each exact legal name of each Person owning Subsidiary
Securities of any such Direct Foreign Subsidiaries and the number and class of
any such Subsidiary Securities owned by such Person, are specified on Schedule
4.03.

     The Borrower further covenants that it shall not change, and shall not
permit any other Grantor or any Direct Foreign Subsidiary that is a Significant
Subsidiary to change, its name, jurisdiction of formation (whether by
reincorporation, merger or otherwise), the location of its chief executive
office, except upon giving written notice (prior to or immediately following
such change) to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and (prior to
such change or, if permitted by applicable Law, simultaneously with such change)
taking or causing to be taken all such action at Borrower's or such other
Grantor's expense as may be required by applicable Law

                                       56

<PAGE>

to maintain the perfection of the Lien of the Collateral Agent in all
Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower
covenants that it shall, and shall cause each Grantor to, (prior to such change
or, if later, immediately upon request) take all such action at Borrower's or
such other Grantor's expense as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral
Agent or the Administrative Agent to perfect or maintain the perfection of the
Lien of the Collateral Agent in Collateral.

     4.04 Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in the Pledge Agreement, in the event that Borrower or any Subsidiary
shall issue any Senior Parity Debt or is a party to the Tech Data TROL Facility,
each of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent is authorized, without the
consent of the Lenders, to enter into one or more intercreditor agreements or
other similar arrangements with the Senior Parity Debt Holders and any Tech Data
TROL Creditors in order to effectuate pari passu status as to the Facility
Guaranties of (and proceeds of Collateral securing) the Obligations, such Senior
Parity Debt, and obligations under the Tech Data TROL Facility, provided that
such pari passu status shall not apply to the property financed by the Tech Data
TROL Facility or any Successor Synthetic Lease Facility (which property shall
secure only such facility). At the election of the Borrower, Senior Parity Debt
may either (i) benefit from a guaranty of payment by Domestic Subsidiaries that
are significant subsidiaries, or (ii) have the benefit of a pledge of the
Pledged Interests in Direct Foreign Subsidiaries that are Significant
Subsidiaries, or (iii) both of the foregoing. Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent shall take all such further actions as are necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 4.04, all at the sole
expense of Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE V.

contained in any agreement or

                                       62

<PAGE>

instrument between the Borrower and any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender
relating to Indebtedness and within the scope of Section 9.01(e) will be margin
stock.

     (b) None of the Borrower, any Person Controlling the Borrower, or any
Subsidiary (i) is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, or (ii) is or is required to be registered as an "investment
company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

     6.15 Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to
it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. No report, financial statement, certificate
or other information furnished (whether in writing or orally) by or on behalf of
any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and the negotiation of this Agreement or
delivered hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so
furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with
respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that
such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to
be reasonable at the time.

     6.16 Compliance with Laws. Each of the Borrower and each Subsidiary is in
compliance in all material respects with the requirements of all Laws and all
orders, writs, injunctions and decrees applicable to it or to its properties,
except in such instances in which (a) such requirement of Law or order, writ,
injunction or decree is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
diligently conducted or (b) the failure to comply therewith, either individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     6.17 Intangible Assets. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own, or possess
the right to use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, patent
rights, franchises, licenses and other intangible assets that are used in the
conduct of their respective businesses as now operated, and none of such items,
to the best knowledge of Borrower, conflicts with the valid trademark, trade
name, copyright, patent, patent right or intangible asset of any other Person to
the extent that such conflict has a Material Adverse Effect.

     6.18 Tax Shelter Regulations. The Borrower does not intend to treat the
Loans and/or Letters of Credit as being a "reportable transaction" (within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). In the event the Borrower
determines to take any action inconsistent with such intention, it will promptly
notify the Administrative Agent thereof. If the Borrower so notifies the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower acknowledges that one or more of the Lenders
may treat its Committed Loans and/or its interest in Swing Line Loans and/or
Letters of Credit as part of a transaction that is subject to Treasury
Regulation Section 301.6112-1, and such Lender or Lenders, as applicable, will
maintain the lists and other records required by such Treasury Regulation. The
Borrower acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any

                                       63

that if (i) a Default exists or (ii) any of the pro forma financial statements
or certificates delivered pursuant to Section 7.16 demonstrates that a Default
would exist after giving effect to such repurchase of Convertible Subordinated

repurchased; or

     (b) amend, modify or change in any manner any term or condition of any
Indebtedness described in Section 8.03(b) or any lease so that the terms and

of such Indebtedness or the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such Guarantee (or a
trustee or agent on behalf of such holder or holders or beneficiary or
beneficiaries) to cause, with the giving of notice if required, such

Relief Law, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or applies for
or consents to the appointment of any receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator,
liquidator, rehabilitator or similar officer for it or for all or any material
part of its property; or any receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator,
liquidator, rehabilitator or similar officer is appointed without the
application or consent of such Person and the appointment continues undischarged
or unstayed for 60 calendar days; or any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law

in a transaction otherwise permitted by this Agreement and not involving (i) the
bankruptcy, insolvency, or any failure to pay obligations of such Subsidiary,
the Borrower or any other Subsidiary, (ii) the application of any Debtor Relief
Law, or (iii) any claim of any creditor, and if applicable foreign Law requires
the appointment of a liquidator to accomplish such liquidation in the
jurisdiction where such Foreign Subsidiary is organized, then the mere
appointment and operation of a liquidator for such purpose in such circumstances
shall not constitute an Event of Default under this clause (f); or

     (g) Inability to Pay Debts; Attachment. (i) The Borrower or any Subsidiary
becomes unable or admits in writing its inability or fails generally to pay its
debts as they become due, or (ii) any writ or warrant of attachment or execution

property of any such Person and is not released, vacated or fully bonded within
30 days after its issue or levy; or

     (h) Judgments. There is entered against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (i)
a final judgment or order for the payment of money in an aggregate amount
exceeding the Threshold Amount (to the extent not covered by insurance provided
by a Person described in Section 7.07 as to which the insurer (and any insurance
or reinsurance company reinsuring any such exposure) does not dispute coverage),
or (ii) any one or more non-monetary final judgments that have, or could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect and, in either case, (A) enforcement proceedings are commenced by
any creditor upon such judgment or order, or (B) there is a period of 30
consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, by reason
of a pending appeal or otherwise, is not in effect; or

     (i) ERISA. (i) An ERISA Event occurs with respect to a Pension Plan or
Multiemployer Plan which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result
in liability of the Borrower under Title IV of ERISA to the Pension Plan,
Multiemployer Plan or the PBGC in an aggregate amount in excess of the Threshold
Amount, or (ii) the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate fails to pay when due, after
the expiration of any applicable grace period, any installment payment with
respect to its withdrawal liability under Section 4201 of ERISA under a
Multiemployer Plan in an aggregate amount in excess of the Threshold Amount; or

     (j) Invalidity of Loan Documents. Any Loan Document, at any time after its
execution and delivery and for any reason other than as expressly permitted
hereunder or satisfaction in full of all the Obligations, ceases to be in full
force and effect; or any Loan Party or any other Person contests in any manner
the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document;

                                       79

<PAGE>

or any Loan Party denies that it has any or further liability or obligation
under any Loan Document, or purports to revoke, terminate or rescind any Loan
Document; or

     (k) Change of Control. There occurs any Change of Control with respect to
the Borrower.

     9.02 Remedies Upon Event of Default. If any Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the
consent of, the Required Lenders, take any or all of the following actions:

     (a) declare the commitment of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation
of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions to be terminated, whereupon such
commitments and obligation shall be terminated;

     (b) declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans, all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable
hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower;

     (c) require that the Borrower Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations (in an
amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent Outstanding Amount thereof, as such amount
may vary from time to time); and

     (d) exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and remedies
available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or applicable law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an
order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the
United States, the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of
the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions shall automatically terminate, the
unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest and other
amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and the
obligation of the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations as
aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further act
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

     9.03 Application of Funds. After the exercise of remedies provided for in
Section 9.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and
payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash
Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to Section 9.02), any amounts
received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent in the following order:

     First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including Attorney Costs and amounts
payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity
as such;

     Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable to the
Lenders (including Attorney

                                       80

<PAGE>

Costs and amounts payable under Article III), ratably among them in proportion
to the amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;

     Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued
and unpaid interest on the Loans and L/C Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders
in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable
to them;

     Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid
principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders in
proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by
them;

     Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, to
Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate
undrawn amount of Letters of Credit; and

     Sixth, to payment of all other amounts due under any of the Loan Documents,
if any, to be applied for the ratable benefit of the recipients, including
amounts due to any of the Lenders or their affiliates in respect of Obligations
consisting of liabilities under any Qualifying Swap Contract with any of the
Lenders or their Affiliates on a pro rata basis according to the amounts owed;
and

     Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been
indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.

Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate
undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fifth above shall be
applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any
amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have
either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to
the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.

                                   ARTICLE X.
                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     10.01 Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent.

     (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of
this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and
perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the

                                       81

<PAGE>

term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the
Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied
(or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.
Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended
to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties.

     (b) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any
Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the
L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the
Administrative Agent in this Article X with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued
by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for
letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
"Administrative Agent" as used in this Article X and in the definition of
"Agent-Related Person" included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or
omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C
Issuer.

     10.02 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents,
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and
other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     10.03 Liability of Administrative Agent. No Agent-Related Person shall (a)
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct
in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible
in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital, statement,
representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof,
contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of
any Loan Party or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.

     10.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent.

     (a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution,
representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement or
other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party),
independent accountants and

                                       82

<PAGE>

other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any
Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first
be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability
and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required
Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby
in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

     (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in
Section 5.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have
consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or
other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable
or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its
objection thereto.

     10.05 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect
to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default." The Administrative Agent will notify the
Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default as may be directed by the Required
Lenders in accordance with Article IX; provided, however, that unless and until
the Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable or
in the best interest of the Lenders.

     10.06 Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person
to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have
disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all
applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action

                                       83

<PAGE>

under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any
Agent-Related Person.

     10.07 Indemnification of Administrative Agent. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify
upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on
behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party
to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and
against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however,
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of
any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the
Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred
by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent
that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on
behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations
and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

     10.08 Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. Bank of America and
its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of,
accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with
each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though Bank of
America were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer hereunder and
without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that,
pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive
information regarding any Loan Party or its Affiliates (including information
that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party
or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under
no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans,
Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as
any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not
the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders"
include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

     10.09 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign
as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders; provided that any
such resignation by

                                       84

<PAGE>

Bank of America shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer and Swing
Line Lender. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the
Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative
agent for the Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall be consented
to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of
Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the
Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, the
Person acting as such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the
rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and
Swing Line Lender and the respective terms "Administrative Agent," "L/C Issuer"
and "Swing Line Lender" shall mean such successor administrative agent, Letter
of Credit issuer and swing line lender, and the retiring Administrative Agent's
appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated and
the retiring L/C Issuer's and Swing Line Lender's rights, powers and duties as
such shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part
of such retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender or any other Lender, other than
the obligation of the successor L/C Issuer to issue letters of credit in
substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such
succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer
to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to
such Letters of Credit. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X and Sections
11.04 and 11.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no
successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent
by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice
of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the
duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the
Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

     10.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and
payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower)
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

          (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal
     and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and
     all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
     documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of
     the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the
     reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
     Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and
     counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
     under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.09 and 11.04) allowed in such judicial
     proceeding; and

                                       85

<PAGE>

          (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
     deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04.

     Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent
to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

     10.11 Collateral and Guaranty Matters.

     (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 10.09) appoints,
designates and authorizes the Collateral Agent to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by
the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan
Document, the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,
except those expressly set forth herein and in the Pledge Agreement, nor shall
the Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with
any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Collateral
Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the
term "agent" in this Agreement with reference to the Collateral Agent is not
intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations
arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used
merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only
an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. Without
limiting the generality of Section 10.08, each Lender hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the Collateral Agent is acting as a collateral agent for the
Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Tech Data TROL
Creditors and Senior Parity Debt Holders as provided in the Pledge Agreement and
authorizes the Collateral Agent to carry out all those obligations and shall be
entitled to all the rights and benefits of the collateral agent described in the
Pledge Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall have all of the benefits and
immunities (i) provided to Administrative Agent in this Article X with respect
to the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated therein, including
without limitation any acts taken or omissions suffered by the Collateral Agent
in connection with or contemplated by such documents or transactions as fully as
if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in this Article X included the
Collateral Agent with respect to such documents, transactions, acts or
omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided in this

                                       86

<PAGE>

Agreement, and specifically Article XI hereof, and the other Loan Documents with
respect to the Collateral Agent.

     (b) Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent is authorized
on behalf of all the Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further
consent from the Lenders, from time to time to (i) take any action with respect
to any Collateral or the Pledge Agreement which may be necessary to perfect and
maintain perfected the security interest in and Liens upon the Collateral
granted pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (ii) without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to enter into agreements whereby the Pledge
Agreement, the Facility Guaranty or the Intercreditor Agreement are amended to
better conform the terms thereof to any form attached to this Agreement or to
make administrative or housekeeping corrections to any such agreement.

     (c) The Lenders irrevocably authorize each of the Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion,

          (i) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the
     Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (A)
     upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all
     Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the
     expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (B) that is sold or to
     be sold as part of or in connection with any sale permitted hereunder or
     under any other Loan Document, or (C) subject to Section 11.01, if
     approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders;

          (ii) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the
     Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the
     holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 8.01(i);

          (iii) upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of information satisfactory
     to the Collateral Agent that any Direct Foreign Subsidiary has ceased to be
     a Significant Subsidiary as a result of a transaction or decline in
     business permitted hereunder and no Default is then existing, to release
     the Lien of the Pledge Agreement with respect to the Pledged Interests of
     such Subsidiary;

          (iv) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Facility
     Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a
     transaction permitted hereunder and no Default is then existing; and

          (v) upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of information
     satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that any Domestic Subsidiary has
     ceased to be a Significant Subsidiary as a result of a transaction or
     decline in business permitted hereunder and no Default is then existing, to
     release such Subsidiary from its obligations under the Facility Guaranty,
     unless after giving effect to such release, the sum of the total assets
     (including interests in their respective Subsidiaries) or total annual
     revenues (on a consolidated basis with their respective Subsidiaries) of
     those Domestic Subsidiaries (other than Tech Data Finance SPV) that have
     not executed and delivered to Administrative Agent a Facility

                                       87

<PAGE>

     Guaranty (or whose Facility Guaranty has been released) would exceed in the
     aggregate of $150,000,000.

     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each of TD
Fulfillment Services, LLC and Tech Data International Finance Holding, Inc. is
hereby released from its obligations under the Facility Guaranty, and (B) the
Lien of the Collateral Agent on the Pledged Interests of each of the Released
Foreign Subsidiaries is confirmed to have been released prior to the date
hereof. In addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (Y) if
any French Subsidiary ceases to be Direct Foreign Subsidiary within sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date and no Default is then existing, the Collateral
Agent is hereby authorized to release its Lien on the Pledged Interests of such
French Subsidiary, and (Z) if Tech Data Worldwide Partner LLC or Tech Data
International Investment LLC ceases to be a Significant Subsidiary within sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date and no Default is then existing, the Collateral
Agent is hereby authorized to release such Subsidiary from its obligations under
the Facility Guaranty.

     Upon request by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent at any
time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral Agent's or
Administrative Agent's authority to release or subordinate its interest in
particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its
obligations under the Facility Guaranty pursuant to this Section 10.11.

     Notwithstanding the release of any Subsidiary from its obligations under
the Facility Guaranty (or release of the Lien on any Pledged Interests of any
Subsidiary), if such Subsidiary is thereafter a Significant Subsidiary that is a
Domestic Subsidiary or Direct Foreign Subsidiary, the requirements of Section
7.12 shall again apply to such Subsidiary.

     10.12 Other Agents; Arrangers and Managers. None of the Lenders or other
Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as a
"syndication agent," "co-syndication agent," "documentation agent," "co-agent,"
"book manager," "lead manager," "arranger," "lead arranger" or "co-arranger"
shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under
this Agreement other than, in the case of such Lenders, those applicable to all
Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other
Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not
rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter
into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     11.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the
Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing
signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as
the case may be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific

                                       88

<PAGE>

instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that
no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:

     (a) waive any condition set forth in Section 5.01(a) without the written
consent of each Lender;

     (b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any
Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 9.02) without the written consent of
such Lender;

     (c) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document
for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders
(or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written
consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

     (d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on,
any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or (subject to clause (iv) of the second proviso to
this Section 11.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any
other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall
be necessary to amend the definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any
obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate;

     (e) change Section 2.13 or Section 9.03 in a manner that would alter the
pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of
each Lender; or

     (f) change any provision of this Section or the definition of "Required
Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of
Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or
make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written
consent of each Lender;

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the L/C Issuer in addition to the Lenders required above,
affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Letter
of Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by
it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by
the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the
rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Agreement; (iii) no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document; and (iv) the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges
thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have
any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder,
except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended
without the consent of such Lender.

     11.02 Notices and Other Communications; Facsimile Copies.

     (a) General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and
other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including by
facsimile transmission). All such written notices shall be mailed, faxed or
delivered to the applicable address, facsimile

                                       89

<PAGE>

number or (subject to subsection (c) below) electronic mail address, and all
notices and other communications expressly permitted hereunder to be given by
telephone shall be made to the applicable telephone number, as follows:

          (i) if to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or
     the Swing Line Lender, to the address, facsimile number, electronic mail
     address or telephone number specified for such Person on Schedule 11.02 or
     to such other address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or
     telephone number as shall be designated by such party in a notice to the
     other parties; and

          (ii) if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile number,
     electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its Administrative
     Questionnaire or to such other address, facsimile number, electronic mail
     address or telephone number as shall be designated by such party in a
     notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the
     Swing Line Lender.

All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given or made
upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the relevant party hereto and
(ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when signed for by or on behalf of
the relevant party hereto; (B) if delivered by mail, four Business Days after
deposit in the mails, postage prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile, when sent
and receipt has been confirmed by telephone; and (D) if delivered by electronic
mail (which form of delivery is subject to the provisions of subsection (c)
below), when delivered; provided, however, that notices and other communications
to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender pursuant
to Article II shall not be effective until actually received by such Person. In
no event shall a voicemail message be effective as a notice, communication or
confirmation hereunder.

     (b) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan Documents may
be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of any such
documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the same force
and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all Loan
Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may
also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a
manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request
or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document
or signature.

     (c) Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and Internet and
intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine communications, such as
financial statements and other information as provided in Section 7.02, and to
distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties thereto, and may not be
used for any other purpose.

     (d) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent
and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including
telephonic Committed Loan Notices and Swing Line Loan Notices) purportedly given
by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a
manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any
other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood
by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall
indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all losses, costs,
expenses and

                                       90

<PAGE>

liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice
purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and
other communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the
Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such
recording.

     11.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies,
powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

     11.04 Attorney Costs, Expenses and Taxes. The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or
reimburse the Administrative Agent for all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendment, waiver, consent or
other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are consummated), and the
consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including all Attorney Costs, and (b) to pay or reimburse the
Administrative Agent and each Lender for all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any
rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including
all such costs and expenses incurred during any "workout" or restructuring in
respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding, including any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all Attorney Costs. The
foregoing costs and expenses shall include all search, filing, recording, title
insurance and appraisal charges and fees and taxes related thereto, and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the cost of
independent public accountants and other outside experts retained by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 11.04
shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements
in this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and
repayment of all other Obligations.

     11.05 Indemnification by the Borrower. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact
(collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind
or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of or
in connection with (a) the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or
administration of any Loan Document or any other agreement, letter or instrument
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment, Loan
or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom
(including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a
Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do
not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (c) any actual or
alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property

                                       91

<PAGE>

currently or formerly owned or operated by the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any
other Loan Party, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the
Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party, or (d) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including
any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened
claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of whether any
Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified
Liabilities"), in all cases, whether or not caused by or arising, in whole or in
part, out of the negligence of the Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity
shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee
shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any
information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar
information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement, nor shall
any Indemnitee have any liability for any indirect or consequential damages
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its
activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the
Closing Date). All amounts due under this Section 11.05 shall be payable within
ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any
Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

     11.06 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of
the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such
payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof (or the Dollar
Equivalent amount thereof) is subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its
discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in
connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then
(a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b)
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its
applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such
payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
time in effect, in the applicable currency of such recovery or repayment.

     11.07 Successors and Assigns.

     (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, (iii) by way
of pledge or assignment of a security

                                       92

<PAGE>

interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) or (h) of this Section
(and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be
null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent
provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

     (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all
or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this
subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at
the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of
the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans
at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in subsection (g) of this
Section) with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which
for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such
assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date"
is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not
be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise
consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii)
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part
of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii)
shall not apply to rights in respect of Swing Line Loans; (iii) any assignment
of a Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and
the Swing Line Lender unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself
a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an
Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with
a processing and recordation fee of $4,000. Subject to acceptance and recording
thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section,
from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption,
the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 11.04 and 11.05 with respect to facts and circumstances
occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, the
Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee
Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under
this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

     (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the

                                       93

<PAGE>

Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C
Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
(the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

     (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other
than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or
Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C
Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 11.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 11.09 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a
Lender.

     (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 11.15 as though
it were a Lender.

     (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if
any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to
secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     (g) As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

                                       94

<PAGE>

          "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender;
     (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural
     person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the
     Swing Line Lender, and (ii) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, the Borrower (each such approval not to be unreasonably
     withheld or delayed); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing,
     "Eligible Assignee" shall not include the Borrower or any of the Borrower's
     Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

          "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will
     be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in
     commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of
     its business.

          "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a)
     a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of
     an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

     (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender
that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans
owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of
obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such
obligations or securities, provided that unless and until such trustee actually
becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 11.07,
(i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations
under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise
any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even though such trustee
may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through
foreclosure or otherwise.

     (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any
time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to
subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, (i) upon 30 days' notice to the
Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon 30 days' notice
to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such
resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled
to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender
hereunder, provided that such successor has consented to such appointment, and
provided further that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor,
and no failure by any such successor to consent to such appointment, shall
affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as
the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all
the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all
Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C
Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to
require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk
participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If Bank of
America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the
Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made
by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including
the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk
participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).

     11.08 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority (including any self-regulatory authority, such as
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required
by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process,
(d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of
rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee
of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective
counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to
the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the written consent of the Borrower
or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than
as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Borrower, provided (in the case of this clause (y)) that such
Information is not known to such Administrative Agent or such Lender to be bound
by another confidentiality agreement or other legal or contractual obligation of
confidentiality with respect to such Information. For purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from any Loan Party relating to any
Loan Party or any of their respective businesses, other than any such
information that is Pre-Disclosure Information (defined below), provided that,
in the case of information received from a Loan Party after the date hereof,
such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.
For the purposes of this Section 11.08, "Pre-Disclosure Information" means
information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party, provided that such
information is not known by such Administrative Agent or such Lender to be bound
by another confidentiality agreement or other legal or contractual obligation of
confidentiality with respect to such information. Any Person required to
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, "Information" shall not
include, and the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each other party hereto
may disclose without limitation of any kind, any information with respect to the
"tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby
and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are provided to the Administrative Agent or such Lender relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure; provided that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transactions as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of the Loans, Letters of
Credit and transactions contemplated hereby.

     11.09 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender and each of such Lender's Affiliates is authorized at any
time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other
Loan Party, any such notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and
on behalf of each Loan Party) to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off
and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such
Lender (or any such Affiliate) to or for the credit or the account of the
respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing,
irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall
have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although
such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency
different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness. Each Lender
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any
such set-off and application made by such Lender or any Affiliate of such
Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such set-off and application.

     11.10 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the
Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest
permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative Agent or
any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate,
the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it
exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether
the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or
a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an
expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments
and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in
equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated
term of the Obligations hereunder.

     11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

     11.12 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents,
comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral,
on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or
remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan
Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document
was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and
shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in
accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

     11.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
shall survive the execution and

                                       97

<PAGE>

delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or
will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of
any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other
Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit
shall remain outstanding.

     11.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality,
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the
parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of
which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

     11.15 Tax Forms. (a) (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States person"
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign Lender") shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to
withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest
herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any
successor thereto (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to an
exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to
such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form
W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such
Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other
evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such
Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code.
Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly
submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed
copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from
time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be
available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or
such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of
any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in
respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any
change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially
disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be
reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to
avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or
withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.

     (ii) Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to act
for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to
such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a
typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
on the date when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with
respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other

                                       98

<PAGE>

times as may be necessary in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in
the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed copies
of the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set forth
above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to
which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to U.S.
withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or
any successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses to
transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption
required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own
account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender.

     (iii) The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount to
any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with respect to any Taxes required to
be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or
statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant
to this Section 11.15(a) or (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the
foregoing provisions of this Section 11.15(a); provided that if such Lender
shall have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.15(a) on the date such
Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with respect to any
payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this Section 11.15(a) shall
relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to Section
3.01 in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty
or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly
entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date
establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which
such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan Documents is not
subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.

     (iv) The Administrative Agent may, without reduction, withhold any Taxes
required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the Loan
Documents with respect to which the Borrower is not required to pay additional
amounts under this Section 11.15(a).

     (b) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a
"United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of
IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code,
without reduction.

     (c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent did
not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other
amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties and
interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the
Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses (including
Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the Lenders under
this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments,
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the
Administrative Agent.

     11.16 Governing Law.

     (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
the LAW OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely within such State; PROVIDED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE Agent AND
EACH LENDER SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

     (b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA SITTING
IN PINELLAS COUNTY OR HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, FLORIDA, OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF SUCH STATE, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE Agent AND EACH LENDER CONSENTS, FOR
ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF
THOSE COURTS. THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE Agent AND EACH LENDER IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON
THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF ANY LOAN
DOCUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO. THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE
Agent AND EACH LENDER WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER
PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH
STATE.

     11.17 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH
RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR
TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT
A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR
A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

     11.18 JUDGMENT CURRENCY. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any
court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document
in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that
at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent
could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day
preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower
in respect of any such sum due to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment
in a

                                      100

<PAGE>

currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than that in which such sum is
denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the
"Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day
following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due
in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal
banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.
If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum
originally due to the Administrative Agent in the Agreement Currency, the
Borrower agrees, jointly and severally, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the
Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return
the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be
entitled thereto under applicable law).

     11.19 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE
PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES.
