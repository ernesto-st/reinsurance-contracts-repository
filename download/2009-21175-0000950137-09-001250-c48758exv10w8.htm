<DIV align="Center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>ARTICLE I</B><BR>
<U><B>GENERAL PROVISIONS</B></U>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 <U>Purpose</U>. The purpose of this CNA Supplemental Executive Savings and Capital
Accumulation Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) is to enable selected Employees and former senior Employees of CNA
Financial Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) or its subsidiaries (the &#147;Employers&#148;) to elect to defer
additional compensation, and receive additional matching and other employer contributions, to
compensate them for the limitations imposed upon their benefits under the CNA Savings and Capital
Accumulation Plan in order to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code (the
&#147;Code&#148;), and also to permit the Employers to provide additional amounts of deferred compensation
for other key Employees and former Employees. The Plan was originally adopted jointly by the
Company and Continental Casualty Corporation, one of the Employers, effective as of January&nbsp;1,
1987, under the name of the CNA Employees&#146; Supplemental Savings Plan, and has been amended from
time to time. The Plan was most recently restated as of January&nbsp;1, 2003, pursuant to which
restatement the Company was granted the authority to adopt further amendments to the Plan. The
Plan is hereby further amended to incorporate certain amendments made since the last restatement,
to implement the requirements of &#167;409A of the Code as enacted by the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, and to make other changes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 <U>Effective Date</U>. The Plan was originally effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1987. This
amendment and restatement of the Plan shall be effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2009. Except as
otherwise explicitly provided below, the rights of a Participant whose employment terminated, or
who otherwise became entitled to receive benefits, under the Plan prior to January&nbsp;1, 2009, shall
be determined under the terms of the Plan as in effect at such time; provided that any provision of
this amended and restated plan that is required to be effective prior to such date in order for the
Plan to comply with &#167;409A of the Code shall be effective as of such prior date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3 <U>Company and Employers</U>. The Plan is adopted for the benefit of selected Employees
and former Employees of the Company and the Employers. As of the effective date of this
restatement, Continental Casualty Company is the only Employer participating in the Plan. The
Administrator may permit any other company that is an affiliate or subsidiary of the Company to
participate in the Plan in such manner as the Administrator may determine. Each Employer is liable
for the payment of benefits to a Participant that is or was an Employee of such Employer. The
Company is the sponsor of the Plan for purposes of ERISA and the issuer of all interests in the
Plan for securities laws purposes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4 <U>Plan Year</U>. The Plan Year of the Plan shall coincide with the calendar year,
except as the Administrator shall otherwise determine.

from the general funds of the Participant&#146;s Employer. Each Employer shall establish separate
bookkeeping accounts to reflect its liability under the Plan and may, but shall not be obligated
to, invest in insurance or annuity contracts or other assets to assure a source of funds for the

Participant or other person to receive benefit payments under the provisions of this Plan shall be

establish one or more trusts and contribute, or cause Employers to contribute, amounts to such
trusts to be used for the payment of benefits under this Plan. Any such trust shall be of the type
commonly referred to as a &#147;rabbi trust&#148;, and the Company or Employer shall be treated as the owner
of the assets of such trust for tax purposes in accordance with &#167;671-&#167;678 of the Code. The assets
of any such trust shall remain subject to the claims of creditors of the Company or the Employer
contributing such assets, and no Participant or any other person shall have any beneficial interest
in or other claim to the assets of any such trust beyond that of a general creditor as provided in
Section&nbsp;3.1. Any payments made to or on behalf of a Participant or Beneficiary from any such trust
shall fully discharge the liability of the Company or Employer to such Participant or Beneficiary
under the Plan to the extent of the amount so paid. The Administrator shall have the right to
select, remove, and replace the trustee thereof at any time in its sole discretion, and shall enter

the vested portion of his or her Account if the amount withdrawn is reasonably necessary to satisfy
an unforeseeable financial emergency. Any such withdrawals shall be subject to such rules,
procedures and limitations as the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, determine. For
purposes of this Section&nbsp;3.3, an unforeseeable financial emergency means a severe financial
hardship to the Participant resulting from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the
Participant, one of his or her dependents (as defined in &#167;152(a) of the Code), or the person
designated as the Participant&#146;s primary Beneficiary, loss of the Participant&#146;s property due to
casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of
events beyond the control of the Participant. A financial hardship that is foreseeable or within
the Participant&#146;s control, such as the need or desire to purchase a residence or to send a child to
college, shall not be considered an unforeseeable financial emergency. The determination of
whether a Participant&#146;s need for funds constitutes an unforeseeable financial emergency shall be
made in accordance with the requirements of &#167;409A of the Code. The amount withdrawn may not exceed
the amount necessary to satisfy the financial hardship (taking into account any tax

available to the Participant, including but not limited to reimbursement or compensation by
insurance or otherwise, and the liquidation of other assets to the extent that such liquidation
would not itself cause severe financial hardship. If a Participant has a financial hardship, the
Participant&#146;s Deferral Agreement, if any, shall be revoked for the Plan Year (and no subsequent
Deferral Agreement may be made for the same Plan Year), and the additional income resulting from
such revocation shall be taken into account in determining the amount of distribution reasonably
necessary to relieve the financial hardship. A Participant shall not be required to take any
hardship withdrawal or loan to which he or she is entitled under the S-CAP or any other tax
qualified retirement plan as a condition of receiving a distribution pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3.3,
but if a Participant receives a hardship withdrawal from the S-CAP or any other tax-qualified
&#167;401(k) plan maintained by an Employer and the terms of such plan require a suspension of the
Participant&#146;s deferrals for six months following the date of the distribution, then the
Participant&#146;s Deferral Agreement shall be permanently revoked with respect to any compensation paid
or payable to the Participant during such six month period.

the person making any payment to withhold, from payments made hereunder any taxes required to be
withheld from a Participant&#146;s wages for the federal or any state or local government. To the
extent that benefits hereunder are subject to tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act or
any other law prior to the time that they become payable, the Administrator may withhold, or direct
the Participant&#146;s Employer to withhold, the amount of such taxes from any other compensation or
other amounts payable to the Participant. The Administrator&#146;s determination of the amount to be so
withheld shall be final and binding on all parties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5 <U>Payment on Behalf of Disabled or Incompetent Persons</U>. If a Plan benefit is
payable to a minor or a person declared incompetent or to a person whom the Administrator, in its
sole discretion, determines to be incapable of handling the disposition of property, the
Administrator may direct payment of such Plan benefit to the guardian, legal representative or
person having the care and custody of such minor or incompetent person, or to any other person,
including any family member, whom the Administrator determines in its sole discretion to be best
suited to receive and apply the payment for the benefit of such person. The Administrator may
require proof of incompetency, minority, incapacity or guardianship as it may deem appropriate
prior to distribution of the Plan benefit. Such distribution shall completely discharge the
Company and the Participant&#146;s Employer from all liability with respect to such benefit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.6 <U>Missing Participants or Beneficiaries</U>. If the Administrator is unable to locate
any Participant, Beneficiary or other person entitled to benefits under this Plan, the
Administrator may, in its sole discretion, either cause all or a portion of such payment to be
forfeited and to reduce its obligations under this Plan, or may pay all or a portion of such
benefit to members of the missing person&#146;s family or such other person as it may determine in its
sole discretion to be fair and equitable. Any payment made pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3.6 shall
fully discharge the obligation of the Company and all Employers under this Plan with respect to the
amount so paid.

&#147;Claimant&#148;), who believes that he or she has the right to a benefit that has not been paid, must
file a written claim for such benefit in accordance with the procedures established by the
Administrator. All such claims shall be filed not more than one year after the Claimant knows, or
with the exercise of reasonable diligence would have known, of the basis for such claim. The
preceding sentence shall not be construed to require a Participant or Beneficiary to file a formal
claim for the payment of undisputed benefits in the normal course, but any claim that relates to
the amount of any benefit shall in any event be filed not more than one year after payment of such
benefit commences. The Administrator may retain third party administrators and recordkeepers for
the purpose of processing routine matters relating to the payment of benefits, but correspondence
between a Participant, Beneficiary or other person and such third parties shall not be considered

she has filed a written claim for benefits with the Administrator.

Administrator so notifies the Claimant prior to the end of the initial 90&nbsp;day period, which notice

notified of the reason for the delay not later than five days after the meeting at which the review
would otherwise have been completed, which notice shall explain the reason for the delay and
include an estimate of the time at which the review will be complete. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if at any time the Operations Committee (or any other fiduciary designated to review
appeals) is not scheduled to meet at least quarterly, the decision on review shall be delivered to
the Claimant not more than 60&nbsp;days after the request for review is received, which may be extended
to not more than 120&nbsp;days if special circumstances require and the notice of extension described

procedures, any further legal action taken against the Plan or its fiduciaries by a claimant must
be filed in a court of law no later than 120&nbsp;days after the final adverse benefit determination of
the Operations Committee (or other final appeals fiduciary) is communicated to the claimant or his
or her legal representative, notwithstanding any other statute of limitations. In the event a
claimant wishes to bring a legal action against the Plan or one of its fiduciaries, such legal
action must be filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
