          WHEREAS, the Company has requested the Banks to amend the definitions

          NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

behalf of the Company in respect of the Proposed Equity Issuances, deposit into
trust for the equal and ratable benefit of the holders of the New CNC Preferred
Stock to be repurchased or redeemed (with such funds not being revocable until
two years after the proposed redemption date) that portion of such Net Proceeds
that the Company would have been permitted to apply towards such repurchase or
redemption pursuant to the terms of Sections 2.08(c) and 7.08(c) of the Credit
Agreement if such funds had been applied to repurchase or redeem the New CNC
Preferred Stock within the five Business Days period specified therein (the
"Preferred Stock Redemption Amount"); provided that the Company shall (x) within
three Business Days of the consummation of the Proposed Equity Issuances, give a
written notice of redemption (and deliver a copy of such notice to the Agent) of
the New CNC Preferred Stock as provided in the certificate of designations
setting forth the terms of the New CNC Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of
Designations"), which notice shall specify a redemption date no later than 45
days after the date thereof and shall be with respect to the maximum number of
shares of New CNC Preferred Stock that can be redeemed with the Preferred Stock
Redemption Amount (including an amount in respect of all dividends that will
accrue to the redemption date), (y) within five Business Days after any such Net
Proceeds are received by or on behalf of the Company, prepay Borrowings with the
remaining portion of such Net Proceeds to the extent required by Section 2.08(c)
of the Credit Agreement as modified hereby and (z) apply the Preferred Stock
Redemption Amount to the repurchase or redemption of the New CNC Preferred Stock
as required by and pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations.

          (b) The Banks party hereto hereby waive compliance by the Company with
the provisions of Section 7.02 of the Credit Agreement to the extent (but only
to the extent) necessary to permit the Company to deposit the Preferred Stock
Redemption Amount in a trust account solely for the equal and ratable benefit of
the holders of the New CNC Preferred Stock; provided that such account shall be
funded and maintained solely for the purposes of paying amounts payable upon the
repurchase or redemption of the New CNC Preferred Stock.

                          TO THE COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE








                         Report of Independent Auditors


To Bank of America, N.A., as Agent:

We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, the balance sheet of Conseco, Inc. ("Conseco") and
subsidiaries as of [date] and the related statements of operations, of
shareholders' equity and of cash flows for the year then ended, and have issued
our report thereon dated [date].

In connection with our audit, nothing came to our attention that caused us to
believe that Conseco failed to comply with the terms, covenants, provisions,
conditions or other matters set forth in Schedule 2 of the Compliance
Certificate dated as of [date] delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(a) of the
Credit Agreement dated [date] with Bank of America, N.A., as Agent, and the
other financial institutions party thereto (the "Lenders") insofar as they
relate to accounting matters. However, our audit was not directed primarily
toward obtaining knowledge of such noncompliance. For purposes of Section 7.13
of the Credit Agreement, the "non-recurring cash charges" and "non-recurring
non-cash charges" are defined by Conseco as set forth on Exhibit 1 attached
hereto and we make no comment with respect to such definitions.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of Bank of America,
N.A., as Agent, the Lenders and the board of directors and management of Conseco
and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these
specified parties.
