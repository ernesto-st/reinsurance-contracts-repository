<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>The Exhibits contain other terms, provisions and conditions applicable
to the Loan. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings
assigned to them in <U>Exhibit &#147;B&#148;</U>. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, which must be in form, detail and substance satisfactory to Lenders,
evidence the agreements of Borrower and Lenders with respect to the Loan.
Borrower shall comply with all of the Loan Documents. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2.
<U>Purpose</U>. The proceeds of the Loan shall only be used by Borrower to (i)
refinance a portion of the acquisition cost of the Land and the Improvements,
(ii) fund other costs related to the Land and the Improvements and (iii) fund
closing costs in connection with the Loan. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3.
<U>Commitment to Lend</U>. Borrower agrees to borrow from each Lender, and each
Lender severally agrees to make advances of its Pro Rata Share of the Loan
proceeds to Borrower in amounts at any one time outstanding not to exceed such
Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of the Loan and (except for Administrative Agent with
respect to Administrative Agent Advances), on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section
1.4, and <U>Exhibit &#147;C&#148;</U>, <U>Exhibit &#147;C-1&#148;</U> and <U>Exhibit &#147;F&#148;</U>
attached to this Agreement. Lender&#146;s commitment to lend shall expire and
terminate automatically if the Loan is prepaid in full. The Loan is not
revolving. Any amount repaid may not be reborrowed. </FONT></P>

<U>Syndication/Special Condition to Future Advances</U>.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Lenders shall have
no obligation whatsoever to make the Future Advance unless, within thirty (30)
months of the date hereof, one or more Eligible Assignees, acceptable to
Administrative Agent in Administrative Agent&#146;s sole and absolute discretion,
become Lenders with Commitments which will result in a positive Syndication
Increase Amount (as hereinafter defined). The Loan Amount on the date hereof is
the Initial Advance Amount. Administrative Agent shall endeavor to locate one
or more Eligible Assignees, acceptable to Administrative Agent in its sole and
absolute discretion, which are willing to become Lenders hereunder with
Commitments of up to an aggregate amount equal to the sum of (x) the Future Advance
Amount and (y) $10,000,000. The first $10,000,000 of Commitments taken by new
Lenders after the date hereof, if any, shall be applied to reduce the
Commitment of BofA to $40,000,000. To the extent that, within thirty (30)
months after the date hereof, new Lenders enter into Assignment and Assumption
Agreements to accept commitments in the aggregate amount in excess of
$10,000,000 (the amount of such excess, the &#147;Syndication Increase Amount&#148;),
such occurrence shall constitute a &#147;Successful Syndication&#148;. BofA shall have no
liability to Borrower or any other Person if, for any reason whatsoever,
Eligible Assignees acceptable to BofA, in its sole and absolute discretion, do
not become Lenders within thirty (30) months of the date hereof in such manner
as to allow for the Future Advance to be available to Borrower in accordance
with the terms hereof. If a Successful Syndication does not, for any reason
whatsoever, occur within six (6) months of the date hereof, then Borrower
shall, on the date following the six (6) month anniversary of the date hereof,
be required to make a mandatory principal payment in the amount (the &#147;Lump Sum
Amortization Payment&#148;) sufficient to reduce the Principal Debt to the sum of
(x) $40,000,000 plus (y) the Commitment of any Lender other than BofA. It shall
be a condition to any Syndication Increase Amount taking effect that (i)
Borrower and all Lenders enter into an agreement modifying or supplementing
this Agreement, in form and substance acceptable to Administrative Agent,
setting forth the</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>Commitment and Pro Rata Share of each Lender, the Syndication Increase
Amount and Future Advance Amount as of such date (subject to adjustment in
accordance with the definition of Future Advance Amount) and (ii) Borrower
shall execute such Future Advance Notes and replacement initial Advance Notes
as Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to effectuate the syndication
of Commitments contemplated hereby. If a Successful Syndication does not, for
any reason whatsoever, occur within thirty (30) months of the date hereof, then
the commitment to lend the Future Advance shall terminate and the Lenders shall
have no obligation to make, and Borrower shall not be entitled to receive, any
Future Advance. </FONT></P>

<U>Evidence of Debt</U>. Amounts of the Loan made by each Lender shall be
evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or
records maintained by Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error of the amount of the Loan made by Lenders to Borrower and
the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in
doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of
Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Indebtedness. In
the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any
Lender and the accounts and records of Administrative Agent in respect of such

The unpaid principal balance of this Loan from day to day outstanding which is
not past due, shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate of interest equal to
the BBA LIBOR Daily Floating Rate plus the LIBOR Margin. The &#147;BBA LIBOR Daily
Floating Rate&#148; shall mean a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the British
Bankers Association LIBOR Rate (&#147;BBA LIBOR&#148;), as published by Reuters (or other
commercially available source providing quotations of BBA LIBOR as selected by
Administrative Agent from time to time) as determined for each Business Day at
approximately 11:00 a.m. London time two (2) London Banking Days prior to the
date in question, for U.S. Dollar deposits (for delivery on the first day of
such interest period) with a one month term, as adjusted from time to time in
Administrative Agent&#146;s sole discretion for reserve requirements, deposit
insurance assessment rates and other regulatory costs. If such rate is not
available at such time for any reason, then the rate will be determined by such
alternative method as reasonably selected by Administrative Agent. A &#147;London
Banking Day&#148; is a day on which banks in London are open for business and
dealing in offshore dollars. Interest shall be computed for the actual number
of days which have elapsed, on the basis of a 360-day year. </FONT></P>

<U>Notice and Cure of Lender Default; Election Period; Electing Lenders</U>.
Administrative Agent shall notify (such notice being referred to as the
&#147;Default Notice&#148;) Borrower (for Loan advances) and each non-Defaulting Lender
if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender. Each non-Defaulting Lender shall have the
right, but in no event or under any circumstance the obligation, to fund such
Defaulting Lender Amount, provided that within twenty (20) days after the date
of the Default Notice (the &#147;Election Period&#148;), such non-Defaulting Lender or
Lenders (each such Lender, an &#147;Electing Lender&#148;) irrevocably commit(s) by
notice in writing (an &#147;Election Notice&#148;) to Administrative Agent, the other
Lenders and Borrower to fund the Defaulting Lender Amount. If Administrative
Agent receives more than one Election Notice within the Election Period, then
the commitment to fund the Defaulting Lender Amount shall be apportioned pro
rata among the Electing Lenders in the proportion that the amount of each such
Electing Lender&#146;s Commitment bears to the total Commitments of all Electing
Lenders. If the Defaulting Lender fails to pay the Defaulting Lender Payment
Amount within the Election Period, the Electing Lender or Lenders, as
applicable, shall be automatically obligated to fund the Defaulting Lender
Amount (and Defaulting Lender shall no longer be entitled to fund such
Defaulting Lender Amount) within three (3) Business Days following the
expiration of the Election Period to reimburse Administrative Agent or make
payment to Borrower, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if Administrative Agent has funded the Defaulting Lender
Amount, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement for its portion
of the Defaulting Lender Payment Amount pursuant to Section 5.11. </FONT></P>

<U>Removal of Rights; Indemnity</U>. Administrative Agent shall not be
obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by or on behalf
of Borrower to Administrative Agent for the Defaulting Lender&#146;s benefit; nor
shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to the sharing of any payments hereunder
or under any Note until all Defaulting Lender Payment Amounts are paid in full.
Amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender shall be paid by Administrative Agent to
reimburse Administrative Agent and any Electing Lender pro rata for all
Defaulting Lender Payment Amounts. Solely for the purposes of voting or
consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents, a Defaulting Lender
shall be deemed not to be a &#147;Lender&#148; and such Defaulting Lender&#146;s Commitment
shall be deemed to be zero. A Defaulting Lender shall have no right to
participate in any discussions among and/or decisions by Lenders hereunder
and/or under the other Loan Documents. Further, any Defaulting Lender shall be
bound by any amendment to, or waiver of, any provision of, or any action taken
or omitted to be taken by Administrative Agent and/or the non-Defaulting
Lenders under, any Loan Document which is made subsequent to the Defaulting
Lender&#146;s becoming a Defaulting Lender. This Section shall remain effective with
respect to a Defaulting Lender until such time as the Defaulting Lender shall
no longer be in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement by
curing such default by payment of all Defaulting Lender Payment Amounts (i)
within the Election Period, or (ii) after the Election Period with the consent
of the non-Defaulting Lenders. Such Defaulting Lender nonetheless shall be
bound by any amendment to or waiver of any provision of, or any action taken or
omitted to be taken by Administrative Agent and/or the non-Defaulting Lenders
under any Loan Document which is made subsequent to that Lender&#146;s </FONT></P>

operation of this subsection or the subsection above alone shall not be
construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any non-Defaulting
Lender, or relieve or excuse the performance by Borrower of their duties and
obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents. Furthermore,
nothing contained in this Section shall release or in any way limit a
Defaulting Lender&#146;s obligations as a Lender hereunder and/or under any other of
the Loan Documents. Further, a Defaulting Lender shall indemnify and hold
harmless Administrative Agent and each of the non-Defaulting Lenders from any
claim, loss, or costs incurred by Administrative Agent and/or the
non-Defaulting Lenders as a result of a Defaulting Lender&#146;s failure to comply
with the requirements of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any and
all additional losses, damages, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by Administrative Agent and any
non-Defaulting Lender as a result of and/or in connection with (i) a
non-Defaulting Lender&#146;s acting as an Electing Lender, (ii) any enforcement
action brought by Administrative Agent against a Defaulting Lender, and (iii)
any action brought against Administrative Agent and/or Lenders. The

<U>Commitment Adjustments</U>. In connection with the adjustment of the amounts
of the Loan Commitments of the Defaulting Lender and Electing Lender(s) upon
the expiration of the Election Period as aforesaid, Borrower, Administrative
Agent and Lenders shall execute such modifications to the Loan Documents as
shall, in the reasonable judgment of Administrative Agent, be necessary or
desirable in connection with the adjustment of the amounts of Commitments in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section. For the purpose of
voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents such
modifications shall also reflect the removal of voting rights of the Defaulting
Lender and increase in voting rights of Electing Lenders to the extent an
Electing Lender has funded the Defaulting Lender Amount. In connection with
such adjustments, Defaulting Lenders shall execute and deliver an Assignment
and Assumption covering that Lender&#146;s Commitment and otherwise comply with
Section 6.5. If a Lender refuses to execute and deliver such Assignment and
Assumption or otherwise comply with Section 6.5, such Lender hereby appoints
Administrative Agent to do so on such Lender&#146;s behalf. Administrative Agent
shall distribute an amended Schedule of Lenders, which shall thereafter be
incorporated into this Agreement, to reflect such adjustments. However, all
such Defaulting Lender Amounts funded by Administrative Agent or Electing
Lenders shall continue to be Defaulting Lender Amounts of the Defaulting Lender
pursuant to its obligations under this Agreement. </FONT></P>

certain of the Loan Documents now or hereafter may have been or will be

and not by or in favor of Lenders, any and all obligations on the part of
Administrative Agent (if any) to make any advances of the Loan or

responsible to Borrower or any other person for any failure by any other Lender
to fulfill its obligations to make advances of the Loan or reimbursements for
other Payment Amounts, nor to take any other action on its behalf hereunder or
in connection with the financing contemplated herein. The failure of any Lender
to pay to Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of a Payment Amount shall not
relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to pay to Administrative
Agent its Pro Rata Share of such Payment Amounts as and when required herein,
but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so
fund its Pro Rata Share of the Payment Amount. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Lenders shall comply with their obligation to pay Administrative Agent their
Pro Rata Share of such Payment Amounts regardless of (i) the occurrence of any
Default hereunder or under any Loan Document; (ii) any failure of
consideration, absence of consideration, misrepresentation, fraud, or any other
event, failure, deficiency, breach or irregularity of any nature whatsoever in
the Loan Documents; or (iii) any bankruptcy, insolvency or other like event
with regard to any Borrower or Guarantor. The obligation of Lenders to pay to
such Payment Amounts are in all regards independent of any claims between
Administrative Agent and any Lender. </FONT></P>

<U>Contracts</U>. Without Administrative Agent&#146;s prior written approval as to
parties, terms, and all other matters, Borrower shall not (a) enter into any
Material Contract, (b) enter into any management, leasing, maintenance or other
contract pertaining to the Property not described in clause (a) that is not
unconditionally terminable by Borrower or any successor owner without penalty
or payment on not more than thirty (30) days&#146; notice to the other party

Borrower shall not default under any contract, Borrower shall not permit any

<U>Assignment of Contracts</U>. As additional security for the Obligations,
Borrower hereby transfers and assigns to Administrative Agent for the ratable
benefit of Administrative Agent and Lenders and grants a security interest in
all of Borrower&#146;s right, title and interest, but not its liability, in, under,
and to all construction, architectural and design contracts, and agrees that
all of the same are covered by the security agreement provisions of the
Mortgage. Borrower agrees to deliver to Administrative Agent from time to time
upon Administrative Agent&#146;s request such consents to the foregoing assignment
from parties contracting with Borrower as Administrative Agent may require.
Neither this assignment nor any action by Administrative Agent or Lenders shall
constitute an assumption by Administrative Agent or Lenders of any obligation
under any contract, Borrower hereby agrees to perform all of its obligations
under any contract, and Borrower shall continue to be liable for all obligations
of Borrower with respect thereto. Administrative Agent shall have the right at
any time (but shall have no obligation) to take in its name or in the name of
Borrower such action as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to
cure any default under any contract or to protect the rights of Borrower,
Administrative Agent or Lenders with respect thereto. Borrower irrevocably
constitutes and appoints Administrative Agent as Borrower&#146;s attorney-in-fact,
which power of attorney is coupled with an interest and irrevocable, to enforce
in Borrower&#146;s name or in Administrative Agent&#146;s and Lender&#146;s name all rights of
Borrower under any contract. Administrative Agent shall incur no liability if
any action so taken by it or on its behalf shall prove to be inadequate or
invalid. Borrower indemnifies and holds Administrative Agent and Lenders
harmless against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense (including, but
not limited to, consultants&#146; fees and expenses and attorneys&#146; fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with Borrower&#146;s failure to perform such
contracts or any such action taken by Administrative Agent or Lenders. Borrower
represents and warrants to Administrative Agent and Lenders that the copy of
any contract furnished or to be furnished to Administrative Agent is and shall
be a true and complete copy thereof, that there have been no modifications
thereof which are not fully set forth in the copies delivered, and that
Borrower&#146;s interest therein is not subject to any claim, setoff, or encumbrance.

prior to the Future Advance Determination Date, the Future Advance Amount and

the most recent appraisal performed pursuant to Section 2.13, as reviewed,
adjusted and approved by Administrative Agent. The Loan to Value Ratio
requirement shall be tested no more often than once per calendar year, unless
one or more events have occurred which have, alone or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. In the event the Loan to Value Ratio covenant is not
met, Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower of such condition and Borrower
may satisfy the Loan to Value Ratio covenant by, within thirty (30) days of
such notice, either (A) making a principal curtailment on the Loan (which shall
not be credited towards future principal amortization required under the Loan

sufficient to bring this Debt Service Coverage Ratio into compliance and/or (B)

occurrence of a Default, and such cost is due and payable by Borrower on demand
and shall be secured by the Loan Documents. Administrative Agent shall provide

hereunder in any one or more instances, or the acceptances by Administrative
Agent or Lenders of any partial payment on account of the Indebtedness, shall

Every right, power and remedy given to Administrative Agent and Lenders by this
Agreement, any Note or any of the other Loan Documents shall be concurrent, and
may be pursued separately, successively or together against Borrower, or the
Property or any part thereof, or any personal property granted as security

Each Lender hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 5.9) appoints, designates
and authorizes Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan
Document, Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,
except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall Administrative Agent have or
be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities
shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist
against Administrative Agent. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term &#147;agent&#148;
herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to Administrative Agent
is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter
of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
No individual Lender or group of Lenders shall have any right to amend or
waive, or consent to the departure of any party from any provision of any Loan
Document, or secure or enforce the obligations of Borrower or any other party
pursuant to the Loan Documents, or otherwise.
All such rights, on behalf of Administrative Agent or any Lender or
Lenders, shall be held and exercised solely by and at the option of
Administrative Agent for the pro rata benefit of Lenders. Such rights, however,
are subject to the rights of a Lender or Lenders, as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, to approve matters or direct Administrative Agent to take or
refrain from taking action as set forth in this Agreement. Except as expressly
otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
Administrative Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to
exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights, or taking or
refraining from taking any actions which Administrative Agent is expressly
entitled to exercise or take under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
including, without limitation, (i) the determination if and to what extent
matters or items subject to Administrative Agent&#146;s satisfaction are acceptable
or otherwise within its discretion, (ii) the making of Administrative Agent
Advances, and (iii) the exercise of remedies pursuant to, but subject to,
Article 4 or pursuant to any other Loan Document and any action so taken or not
taken shall be deemed consented to by Lenders. </FONT></P>

of whether the principal of the Loan shall then be due and payable as herein

constitutes willful misconduct or gross negligence on Administrative Agent&#146;s
part; and provided further that Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to
provide any Lender with any information in violation of Law or any contractual
restrictions on the disclosure thereof (provided such contractual restrictions
shall not apply to distributing to a Lender factual and financial information
expressly required to be provided herein).
Except as set forth above, Administrative Agent shall not have any duty

Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrower
and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do so), pro rata, and hold
harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified

Person&#146;s own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no
action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be
deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of
this Section. Without limitation of the
foregoing, to the extent that Administrative Agent is not reimbursed by or on
behalf of Borrower, each Lender shall reimburse Administrative Agent upon
demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including
attorney fees) incurred by Administrative Agent as described in Section
6.10. The undertaking in this Section
shall survive the payment of all Indebtedness hereunder and the resignation or

underwriting or other business with any party to the Loan Documents and their
respective Affiliates as though Administrative Agent were not Administrative
Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of Lenders. Lenders acknowledge that Borrower and Bank
of America, N.A. or its Affiliate have entered or may enter into Swap
Transactions. A portion of the Loan may
be funded to honor Borrower&#146;s payment obligations under the terms of such Swap
Transactions, and Lenders shall have no right to share in any portion of such
payments. Lenders acknowledge that,
pursuant to such activities, Bank of America, N.A. or its Affiliates may receive
information regarding any party to the Loan Documents, or their respective
Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of such parties or such parties&#146; Affiliates) and

such information to them. With respect
to its Pro Rata Share of the Loan, Bank of America, N.A. shall have the same

shall, resign as Administrative Agent upon thirty (30) days&#146; notice to Lenders. If Administrative Agent resigns under this
Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among Lenders a successor
administrative agent for Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall be
consented to by Borrower at all times other than during the existence of a
Default (which consent of Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If no successor
administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the
resignation of Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent may appoint, after
consulting with Lenders and Borrower, a successor administrative agent from
among Lenders. Upon the acceptance of
its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, such successor
administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent and the term &#147;Administrative Agent&#148; shall mean
such successor administrative agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s

resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article
and other applicable Sections of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as

Agent under this Agreement. If no
successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent
by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Administrative
Agent&#146;s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s resignation
shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and Lenders shall perform all of
the duties of Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the

If all or any portion of the Loan collateral is acquired by foreclosure or by

collateral in its name or by an Affiliate of Administrative Agent, but for the
benefit of all Lenders in their Pro Rata Shares on the date of the foreclosure
sale or recordation of the deed in lieu of foreclosure (the &#147;Acquisition
Date&#148;). Administrative Agent and all
Lenders hereby expressly waive and relinquish any right of partition with
respect to any collateral so acquired.
After any collateral is acquired, Administrative Agent shall appoint and
retain one or more persons (individually and collectively, &#147;Property Manager&#148;)
experienced in the management, leasing, sale and/or dispositions of similar
properties. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After

management, improvement, maintenance, repair, sale and disposition of the Loan
collateral and a budget for the aforesaid, which may include a reasonable
management fee payable to Administrative Agent (the &#147;Business Plan&#148;). Administrative Agent will deliver the
Business Plan not later than the sixtieth (60th) day after the Acquisition Date
to each Lender with a written request for approval of the Business Plan. If the
Business Plan is approved by the Required Lenders, Administrative Agent and the
Property Manager shall adhere to the Business Plan until a different Business
Plan is approved by the Required Lenders.
Administrative Agent may propose an amendment to the Business Plan as it
deems appropriate, which shall also be subject to Required Lender
approval. If the Business Plan (as may
be amended) proposed by Administrative Agent is not approved by the Required
Lenders, (or if sixty (60) days have elapsed following the Acquisition Date
without a Business Plan being proposed by Administrative Agent), any Lender may
propose an alternative Business Plan, which Administrative Agent shall submit
to all Lenders for their approval. If an alternative Business Plan is approved
by the Required Lenders, Administrative Agent may appoint one of the approving
Lenders to implement the alternative Business Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, unless in
violation of an approved Business Plan or otherwise in an emergency situation,
Administrative Agent shall, subject to subsection (a) of this Section, have the
right but not the obligation to take any action in connection with the Loan
collateral (including those with respect to property taxes, insurance premiums,
completion of construction, operation, management, improvement, maintenance,
repair, sale and disposition), or any portion thereof. </FONT></P>

determined by Administrative Agent, including the undiscounted face principal
amount of any purchase money obligation not payable at closing) (&#147;Net

interest in the collateral for a purchase price payable by the non-consenting
Lender in an amount equal to the consenting Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of the Net

Indemnified Liabilities and/or foreclosure or sale of the collateral, and net
operating income from the collateral during any period it is owned by
Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders (&#147;Payments&#148;) shall be apportioned pro

Administrative Agent&#146;s separate account) shall, as applicable, be apportioned
pro rata among Lenders. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Payments due and payable to
Defaulting Lenders shall be due and payable to and be apportioned pro rata
among Administrative Agent and Electing Lenders. Such apportionment shall be in the proportion that the Defaulting
Lender Payment Amounts paid by them bears to the total Defaulting Lender
Payment Amounts of such Defaulting Lender.
Such apportionment shall be made until Administrative Agent and Lenders
have been paid in full for the Defaulting Lender Payment Amounts. All pro rata Payments shall be remitted to
Administrative Agent and all such payments not constituting payment of specific
fees, and all proceeds of the Loan collateral received by Administrative Agent,
shall be applied first, to pay any fees, indemnities, costs, expenses
(including those in Section 5.7) and reimbursements then due to Administrative
Agent from Borrower; second, to pay any fees, costs, expenses and reimbursements
then due to Lenders from Borrower; third, to pay pro rata interest and late

fourth, to pay or prepay pro rata principal of the Indebtedness and
Administrative Agent Advances; fifth, to pay any indebtedness of Borrower under
Swap Transactions; and last, to Borrower, if required by law, or Lenders in Pro

<U>Consents; Borrower&#146;s Indemnity</U>. Except where otherwise expressly
provided in the Loan Documents, in any instance where the approval, consent or
the exercise of Administrative Agent&#146;s or Lenders&#146; judgment is required, the
granting or denial of such approval or consent and the exercise of such
judgment shall be (a) within the sole discretion of Administrative Agent or
Lenders; (b) deemed to have been given only by a specific writing intended for
the purpose given and executed by Administrative Agent or Lenders; and (c) free
from any limitation or requirement of reasonableness. Notwithstanding any approvals or consents by Administrative Agent
or Lenders, neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any obligation or
responsibility whatsoever for the adequacy, form or content of any appraisal,
any contract, any lease, or any other matter incident to the Property. Any inspection, appraisal or audit of the
Property or the books and records of Borrower, or the procuring of documents
and financial and other information, by or on behalf of Administrative Agent
shall be for Administrative Agent&#146;s and Lenders&#146; protection only, and shall not
constitute an assumption of responsibility to Borrower or anyone else with
regard to the condition, value, construction, maintenance or operation of the
Property, or relieve Borrower of any of Borrower&#146;s obligations. Borrower has selected all surveyors,
architects, engineers, contractors, materialmen and all other persons or
entities furnishing services or materials to the Project. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender
has any duty to supervise or to inspect the Property or the construction of the
Improvements nor any duty of care to Borrower or any other person to protect
against, or inform Borrower or any other person of the existence of, negligent,
faulty, inadequate or defective design or construction of the Improvements. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender
shall be liable or responsible for, and Borrower shall indemnify each
Agent-Related Person and each Lender and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, agents, attorneys and employees (collectively, the
&#147;Indemnitees&#148;) from and against: (a) any claim, action, loss or cost (including

Borrower&#146;s surveyors, architects, engineers, contractors or any other person,

the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including
any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened
claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of whether any

causes of action arising out of or relating to the use of Information (as
defined in Section 6.6) or other materials obtained through internet,
Intralinks or other similar information transmission systems in connection with
this Agreement; and (d) any and all liabilities, losses, costs or expenses
(including attorney fees and costs) that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a
result of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand, action, cause of action or
proceeding, or as a result of the preparation of any defense in connection with
any foregoing claim, demand, action, cause of action or proceeding, in all cases,
whether or not an Indemnitee is a party to such claim, demand, action, cause of
action or proceeding and whether it is defeated, successful or withdrawn, (all the
foregoing, collectively, the &#147;Indemnified Liabilities&#148;); provided, however,
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims,

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee. Nothing, including any
advance or acceptance of any document or instrument, shall be construed as a representation
or warranty, express or implied, to any party by Administrative Agent or
Lenders. Inspection, whether or not
followed by notice of Default, shall not constitute a waiver of any Default
then existing, or a waiver of Administrative Agent&#146;s and Lenders&#146; right
thereafter to insist that the Improvements be in compliance with the Loan
Documents, and all applicable Laws, governmental requirements and restrictive

of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such person has exercised the same degree of care
to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such person would accord
to its own confidential information. Administrative Agent and Lenders may

<U>Set-off</U>. In addition to any rights and remedies of Administrative Agent

any Default, Administrative Agent and each Lender is authorized at any time and
from time to time, without prior notice to Borrower or any other party to the
Loan Documents, any such notice being waived by Borrower (on its own behalf and
on behalf of each party to the Loan Documents to the fullest extent permitted
by Law), to set-off and apply any and all deposits, general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final, any time owing by Administrative Agent or such
Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document to or for the credit or the
account of such parties to the Loan Documents against any and all Indebtedness,
irrespective of whether or not Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have
made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such
Indebtedness may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency
different from that of the applicable depositor indebtedness. Each Lender
agrees promptly to notify Borrower and Administrative Agent after any such
set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.</FONT></P>

 <U>Sharing of Payments</U>. If, other
than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account
of the portions of the Loan advanced by it, any payment (whether voluntary,
involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in
excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof,
such Lender shall immediately (a) notify Administrative Agent of such fact, and
(b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the portions of the
Loan made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to
share the excess payment in respect of such portions of the Loan or such
participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described
in Section 6.4 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be
rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying
Lender&#146;s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
paying Lender&#146;s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from
the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered without further
interest thereon. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation
from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all
its rights of payment (including the right of set-off), but subject to Section
6.7 with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the
direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation. Administrative
Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence
of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in
each case notify Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each
Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section shall from and
after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands,
directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the
portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the
purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. </FONT></P>

the required number of Lenders to approve or disapprove any matter or to take

person or the execution by Borrower or any other person of any such amendment
or intercreditor agreement. Subject to the foregoing, Administrative Agent may
amend or waive any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
consent to any departure by any party to the Loan Documents therefrom which
amendment, waiver or consent is intended to be within Administrative Agent&#146;s
discretion or determination, or otherwise if such amendment, waiver or consent

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrower
and Lenders agree as follows:</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
<U>Approved Leases</U>. Borrower shall not enter into any tenant lease of space
in the Improvements unless satisfactory to or deemed satisfactory to
Administrative Agent prior to execution. Borrower&#146;s standard form of tenant
lease, and any revisions thereto, must have the prior written approval of
Administrative Agent. Any tenant lease shall be &#147;deemed&#148; satisfactory to
Administrative Agent that (a) is either on the standard form lease approved by
Administrative Agent, with no material deviations except as satisfactory to
Administrative Agent or on the standard lease form of a national retailer which
contains no provisions materially more adverse to landlord than the provisions
of the lease form approved by Administrative Agent; (b) is entered into in the
ordinary course of business with a bona fide unrelated third party tenant, and
Borrower, acting in good faith and exercising due diligence, has determined
that the tenant is financially capable of performing its obligations under the
lease; (c) is received by Administrative Agent (together with each guarantee
thereof (if any) and financial information regarding the tenant and each
guarantor (if any) received by Borrower) within fifteen (15) days after
execution; (d) reflects an arms-length transaction at then current market rate
for comparable space; (e) contains no right to purchase the Property, or any
present or future interest therein; (f) does not cover in excess of 15,000
square feet of net rentable area of the Improvements; and (g) is expressly
subordinate to the Mortgage. Borrower shall provide to Administrative Agent a
correct and complete copy of each tenant lease, including any exhibits, and
each guarantee thereof (if any), prior to execution unless the lease in
question is reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent under the foregoing
requirements. Borrower shall, throughout the term of this Agreement, pay all
reasonable costs incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with
Administrative Agent&#146;s review and approval of tenant leases and each guarantee
thereof (if any), including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
<U>Effect of Lease Approval</U>. No approval of any lease by Administrative Agent
shall be for any purpose other than to protect Lenders&#146; security, and to
preserve Lenders&#146; rights under the Loan Documents. No approval by
Administrative Agent shall result in a waiver of any default of Borrower. In no
event shall any approval by Administrative Agent of a lease be a representation
of any kind, with regard to the lease or its adequacy or enforceability, or the
financial capacity of any tenant or guarantor.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
<U>Representations Concerning Leases</U>. Borrower represents and warrants to
Administrative Agent and Lenders that Borrower has delivered to Administrative
Agent a true and correct copy of all tenant leases and each guarantee thereof
(if any), affecting any part of the Improvements, together with an accurate and
complete rent roll for the Project, and no such lease or guarantee contains any
option to purchase all or any portion of the Property or any interest therein
or contains any right of first refusal relating to any sale of the Property or
any portion thereof or interest therein.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
<U>Delivery of Leasing Information and Documents</U>. Borrower shall promptly
(a) deliver to Administrative Agent such quarterly rent rolls, leasing
schedules and reports, operating statements, financial statements for tenants
other than residential tenants with a lease term for less than one year and
other information regarding tenants and prospective tenants or other leasing
information as Administrative Agent from time to time may request, and (b)
obtain and deliver to Administrative Agent such estoppel certificates and
subordination and attornment agreements executed by such tenants (and
guarantors, if any) in the respective forms attached as exhibits to the Closing
Checklist, or otherwise in such forms as Administrative Agent from time to time
may reasonably require.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
<U>Income from the Property</U>. Borrower shall first apply all income from
leases, and all other income derived from the Property, to pay costs and
expenses associated with the ownership, maintenance, development, operating,
and marketing of the Land and Improvements, including all amounts then required
to be paid under the Loan Documents, before using or applying such income for
any other purpose.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
<U>Compliance and Default</U>. As additional conditions to Lenders&#146; obligations
under this Agreement, all tenants having the right to do so must approve all
plans and all changes thereto, the construction of the Improvements, and all
other aspects of the Project requiring tenants&#146; approval. A default by Borrower
under or any failure by Borrower to satisfy any of the conditions of a lease
shall constitute a Default under this Agreement. Borrower shall promptly notify
Administrative Agent in writing of any failure by any party to perform any
material obligation under any lease, any event or condition which would permit
a tenant to terminate or cancel a lease, or any notice given by a tenant with
respect to the foregoing, specifying in each case the action Borrower has taken
or will take with respect thereto.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
It shall be a default (&#147;Default&#148;) under this Note and each of the other Loan
Documents if (i) any principal, interest or other amount of money due under
this Note is not paid in full when due, regardless of how such amount may have
become due; (ii) any covenant, agreement, condition, representation or warranty
herein or in any other Loan Documents is not fully and timely performed,

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="100%" SIZE=4><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE='PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: ALWAYS'></P><PAGE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>default under the Mortgage or any other Loan Document. Upon the
occurrence of a Default, Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders shall have
the rights to declare the unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid
interest on this Note, and all other amounts due hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents, at once due and payable (and upon such declaration, the same
shall be at once due and payable), to foreclose any liens and security
interests securing payment hereof and to exercise any of its other rights,
powers and remedies under this Note, under any other Loan Document, or at Law
or in equity.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
All of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges (together, &#147;Rights&#148;) of
Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders provided for in this Note and in any
other Loan Document are cumulative of each other and of any and all other
Rights at Law or in equity. The resort to any Right shall not prevent the
concurrent or subsequent employment of any other appropriate Right. No single
or partial exercise of any Right shall exhaust it, or preclude any other or
further exercise thereof, and every Right may be exercised at any time and from
time to time. No failure by Administrative Agent or Lenders to exercise, nor
delay in exercising any Right, including but not limited to the right to
accelerate the maturity of this Note, shall be construed as a waiver of any
Default or as a waiver of any Right. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing provisions, the acceptance by Lender from time to time of any payment
under this Note which is past due or which is less than the payment in full of
all amounts due and payable at the time of such payment, shall not (i)
constitute a waiver of or impair or extinguish the right of Administrative
Agent or Lenders to accelerate the maturity of this Note or to exercise any
other Right at the time or at any subsequent time, or nullify any prior
exercise of any such Right, or (ii) constitute a waiver of the requirement of
punctual payment and performance or a novation in any respect.</FONT></P>

If any holder of this Note retains an attorney in connection with any Default
or at maturity or to collect, enforce or defend this Note or any other Loan
Document in any lawsuit or in any probate, reorganization, bankruptcy,
arbitration or other proceeding, or if Borrower sues any holder in connection
with this Note or any other Loan Document and does not prevail, then Borrower
agrees to pay to each such holder, in addition to principal, interest and any
other sums owing to Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, all
costs and expenses incurred by such holder in trying to collect this Note or in
any such suit or proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys&#146; fees and
expenses, investigation costs and all court costs, whether or not suit is filed
hereon, whether before or after the Maturity Date, or whether in connection
with bankruptcy, insolvency or appeal, or whether collection is made against
Borrower or any guarantor or endorser or any other person primarily or
secondarily liable hereunder.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <U>Heirs,

representatives, successors and assigns of the parties. The foregoing sentence
shall not be construed to permit Borrower to assign the Loan except as
otherwise permitted under the Loan Documents. As further provided in the Loan

Documents, as set forth in the Loan Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <U>General
Provisions</U>. Time is of the essence with respect to Borrower&#146;s obligations
under this Note. If more than one person or entity executes this Note as
Borrower, all of said parties shall be jointly and severally liable for payment
of the indebtedness evidenced hereby. Borrower and all sureties, endorsers,
guarantors and any other party now or hereafter liable for the payment of this

subordination, exchange or release of any such security or the release of any
party primarily or secondarily liable hereon; (c) agree that neither
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be required first to institute suit
or exhaust its remedies hereon against Borrower or others liable or to become
liable hereon or to perfect or enforce its rights against them or any security
herefor; (d) consent to any extensions or postponements of time of payment of
this Note for any period or periods of time and to any partial payments, before

notice thereof to any of them; and (e) submit (and waive all rights to object)
to non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in
the city and county, and venue in the city or county, in which payment is to be
made as specified in the first paragraph of Page 1 of this Note, for the
enforcement of any and all obligations under this Note and the Loan Documents;
(f) waive the benefit of all homestead and similar exemptions as to this Note;
(g) agree that their liability under this Note shall not be affected or
impaired by any determination that any security interest or lien taken by
Lender to secure this Note is invalid or unperfected; and (h) hereby
subordinate any and all rights against Borrower and any of the security for the
payment of this Note, whether by subrogation, agreement or otherwise, until
this Note is paid in full. A determination that any provision of this Note is
unenforceable or invalid shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any
other provision and the determination that the application of any provision of
this Note to any person or circumstance is illegal or unenforceable shall not
affect the enforceability or validity of such provision as it may apply to
other persons or circumstances. This Note may not be amended except in a
writing specifically intended for such purpose and executed by the party
against whom enforcement of the amendment is sought. Captions and headings in
this Note are for convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing it.
THIS NOTE, AND ITS VALIDITY, ENFORCEMENT AND INTERPRETATION, SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY NEW YORK LAW (WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES) AND
APPLICABLE UNITED STATES FEDERAL LAW.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <U>Notices</U>.
Any notice, request, or demand to or upon Borrower or Lender shall be deemed to
have been properly given or made when delivered in accordance with the Loan
Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <U>No
Usury</U>. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower,
Administrative Agent and all Lenders at all times to comply with applicable
state Law or applicable United States federal Law (to the extent that it
permits a Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve, or receive a greater
amount of interest than under state Law) and that this Section shall control
every other covenant and agreement in this Note and the other Loan Documents.
If applicable state or federal Law should at any time be judicially interpreted
so as to render usurious any amount called for under this Note or under any of
the other Loan </FONT></P>

with respect to the Loan, or if Administrative Agent&#146;s exercise of the option
to accelerate the Maturity Date, or if any prepayment by Borrower results in
Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by applicable
Law, then it is Administrative Agent&#146;s and each Lender&#146;s express intent that
all excess amounts theretofore collected by Administrative Agent or any Lender
shall be credited on the principal balance of this Note and all other
indebtedness and the provisions of this Note and the other Loan Documents shall
immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder
and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new
documents, so as to comply with the applicable Law, but so as to permit the
recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder or thereunder.
All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders for the use, forbearance, or
detention of the Loan shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be
amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of
the Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on
account of the Loan does not exceed the maximum lawful rate from time to time
in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.</FONT></P>

concurrent or subsequent employment of any other appropriate Right. No single
or partial exercise of any Right shall exhaust it, or preclude any other or
further exercise thereof, and every Right may be exercised at any time and from
time to time. No failure by Administrative Agent or Lenders to exercise, nor delay
in exercising any Right, including but not limited to the right to accelerate
the maturity of this Note, shall be construed as a waiver of any Default or as
a waiver of any Right. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
provisions, the acceptance by Lender from time to time of any payment under
this Note which is past due or which is less than the payment in full of all
amounts due and payable at the time of such payment, shall not (i) constitute a
waiver of or impair or extinguish the right of Administrative Agent or Lenders
to accelerate the maturity of this Note or to exercise any other Right at the
time or at any subsequent time, or nullify any prior exercise of any such
Right, or (ii) constitute a waiver of the requirement of punctual payment and
performance or a novation in any respect.</FONT></P>

Documents, as set forth in the Loan Agreement.</FONT></P>

security for the payment of this Note, whether by subrogation, agreement or
otherwise, until this Note is paid in full. A determination that any provision
of this Note is unenforceable or invalid shall not affect the enforceability or
validity of any other provision and the determination that the application of
any provision of this Note to any person or circumstance is illegal or
unenforceable shall not affect the enforceability or validity of such provision
as it may apply to other persons or circumstances. This Note may not be amended
except in a writing specifically intended for such purpose and executed by the
party against whom enforcement of the amendment is sought. Captions and
headings in this Note are for convenience only and shall be disregarded in
construing it. THIS NOTE, AND ITS VALIDITY, ENFORCEMENT AND INTERPRETATION,
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY NEW YORK LAW (WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAWS

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <U>No
Usury</U>. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower,

state Law or applicable United States federal Law (to the extent that it
permits a Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve, or receive a greater
amount of interest than under state Law) and that this Section shall control
every other covenant and agreement in this Note and the other Loan Documents.
If applicable state or federal Law should at any time be judicially interpreted
so as to render usurious any amount called for under this Note or under any of
the other Loan Documents, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved, or
received with respect to the Loan, or if Administrative Agent&#146;s exercise of the
option to accelerate the Maturity Date, or if any prepayment by Borrower
results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by
applicable Law, then it is Administrative Agent&#146;s and each Lender&#146;s express
intent that all </FONT></P>

indebtedness and the provisions of this Note and the other Loan Documents shall
immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder

All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders for the use, forbearance, or
detention of the Loan shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be
amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)

<U>Payment
and Performance</U>. Mortgagor will make due and punctual payment of the
Secured Indebtedness. Mortgagor will timely and properly perform and comply
with all of the covenants, agreements, and conditions imposed upon it by this
Mortgage and the other Loan Documents and will not permit a default to occur
hereunder or thereunder. Time shall be of the essence in this Mortgage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)

<U>Title
and Permitted Encumbrances</U>. Mortgagor has, in Mortgagor&#146;s own right, and
Mortgagor covenants to maintain, lawful, good and marketable title to the
Property, is lawfully seized and possessed of the Property and every part
thereof, and has the right to convey the same, free and clear of all liens,
charges, claims, security interests, and encumbrances except for (i) the
matters, if any, set forth under the heading &#147;Permitted Encumbrances&#148; in <U>Exhibit
B</U> hereto, which are Permitted Encumbrances only to the extent the same are
valid and subsisting and affect the Property, (ii) the liens and security
interests evidenced by this Mortgage, (iii) statutory liens for real estate
taxes and assessments on the Property which are not yet delinquent, and (iv)
other liens and security interests (if any) in favor of Mortgagee (the matters
described in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) being herein
called the &#147;Permitted Encumbrances&#148;). Mortgagor, and Mortgagor&#146;s successors and
assigns, will warrant generally and forever defend title to the Property,
subject as aforesaid, to Mortgagee and his successors or substitutes and
assigns, against the claims and demands of all persons claiming or to claim the
same or any part thereof. Mortgagor will punctually pay, perform, observe and
keep all covenants, obligations and conditions in or pursuant to any Permitted
Encumbrance and will not modify or permit modification of any Permitted
Encumbrance without the prior written consent of Mortgagee. Inclusion of any
matter as a Permitted Encumbrance does not constitute approval or waiver by
Mortgagee of any existing or future violation or other breach thereof by
Mortgagor, by the Property or otherwise. No part of the Property constitutes
all or any part of the principal residence of Mortgagor if Mortgagor is an individual.
If any right or interest of Mortgagee in the Property or any part thereof shall
be endangered or questioned or shall be attacked directly or indirectly,
Mortgagee and Mortgagee, or either of them (whether or not named as parties to
legal proceedings with respect thereto), are hereby authorized and empowered to
take such steps as in their discretion may be proper for the defense of any
such legal proceedings or the protection of such right or interest of
Mortgagee, including but not limited to the employment of independent</FONT></P>

assessments and other charges or levies imposed upon or against or with respect
to the Property or the ownership, use, occupancy or enjoyment of any portion
thereof, or any utility service thereto, as the same become due and payable,
including but not limited to all real estate taxes assessed against the
Property or any part thereof, and shall deliver promptly to Mortgagee such

Mortgagee, without exception for mechanics&#146; liens; (2) property insurance with
respect to all insurable Property, against loss or damage by fire, lightning,
windstorm, explosion, hail, tornado and such additional hazards as are
presently included in &#147;Special Form&#148; (also known as &#147;all-risk&#148;) coverage and
against any and all acts of terrorism and such other insurable hazards as
Mortgagee may require, in an amount not less than 100% of the full replacement
cost, including the cost of debris removal, without deduction for depreciation
and sufficient to prevent Mortgagor and Mortgagee from becoming a coinsurer,
such insurance to be in &#147;builder&#146;s risk&#148; completed value (non-reporting) form
during and with respect to any construction (other than construction of
customary tenant improvements in existing buildings) on the Premises; (3) if
and to the extent any portion of the Improvements is, under the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973 (&#147;FDPA&#148;), as it may be amended from time to time, in a
Special Flood Hazard Area, within a Flood Zone designated A or V in a
participating community, a flood insurance policy in an amount required by
Mortgagee, but in no event less than the amount sufficient to meet the
requirements of applicable law and the FDPA, as such requirements may from time
to time be in effect; (4) general liability insurance, on an &#147;occurrence&#148;
basis, against claims for &#147;personal injury&#148; liability, including bodily injury,
death or property damage liability, for the benefit of Mortgagor as named
insured and Mortgagee as additional insured; (5) statutory workers&#146;
compensation insurance with respect to any work on or about the Premises
(including employer&#146;s liability insurance, if required by Mortgagee), covering
all employees of Mortgagor and any contractor; (6) if there is a general
contractor, during and with respect to any construction (other than
construction of customary tenant improvements in existing buildings) on the
Premises, commercial general liability insurance, including products and
completed operations coverage, and in other respects similar to that described
in clause (4) above, for the benefit of the general contractor as named insured
and Mortgagor and Mortgagee as additional insureds, in addition to statutory
workers&#146; compensation insurance with respect to any work on or about the
Premises (including employer&#146;s liability insurance, if required by Mortgagee),
covering all employees of the general contractor any contractor; and (7) such
other insurance on the Property and endorsements as may from time to time be
required by Mortgagee (including but not limited to soft cost coverage,
automobile liability insurance, business interruption insurance or delayed

use and
occupancy of buildings and improvements. All insurance policies shall be issued
and maintained by insurers, in amounts, with deductibles, limits and
retentions, and in forms satisfactory to Mortgagee, and shall require not less
than ten (10) days&#146; prior written notice to Mortgagee of any cancellation for
nonpayment of premiums, and not less than thirty (30) days&#146; prior written
notice to Mortgagee of any other cancellation or any change of coverage. All
insurance companies must be licensed to do business in the state in which the
Property is located and must have an A.M. Best Company financial and
performance ratings of A-:IX or better. All insurance policies maintained, or
caused to be maintained, by Mortgagor with respect to the Property, except for
general liability insurance, shall provide that each such policy shall be
primary without right of contribution from any other insurance that may be
carried by Mortgagor or Mortgagee and that all of the provisions thereof,
except the limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as if there
were a separate policy covering each insured. If any insurer which has issued a
policy of title, hazard, liability or other insurance required pursuant to this
Mortgage or any other Loan Document becomes insolvent or the subject of any
petition, case, proceeding or other action pursuant to any Debtor Relief Law,
or if in Mortgagee&#146;s reasonable opinion the financial responsibility of such
insurer is or becomes inadequate, Mortgagor shall, in each instance promptly
upon its discovery thereof or upon the request of Mortgagee therefor, and at
Mortgagor&#146;s expense, promptly obtain and deliver to Mortgagee a like policy
(or, if and to the extent permitted by Mortgagee, acceptable evidence of
insurance) issued by another insurer, which insurer and policy meet the
requirements of this Mortgage or such other Loan Document, as the case may be.
Without limiting the discretion of Mortgagee with respect to required
endorsements to insurance policies, all such policies for loss of or damage to
the Property shall contain a standard mortgagee clause (without contribution)
naming Mortgagee as mortgagee with loss proceeds payable to Mortgagee
notwithstanding (i) any act, failure to act or negligence of or violation of
any warranty, declaration or condition contained in any such policy by any
named or additional insured; (ii) the occupation or use of the Property for
purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms of any such policy; (iii)
any foreclosure or other action by Mortgagee under the Loan Documents; or (iv)
any change in title to or ownership of the Property or any portion thereof,
such proceeds to be held for application as provided in the Loan Documents. The
originals of each initial insurance policy (or to the extent permitted by
Mortgagee, a copy of the original policy and such evidence of insurance
acceptable to Mortgagee) shall be delivered to Mortgagee at the time of
execution of this Mortgage, with all premiums fully paid current, and each
renewal or substitute policy (or evidence of insurance) shall be delivered to
Mortgagee, with all premiums fully paid current, at least ten (10) days before
the termination of the policy it renews or replaces. Mortgagor shall pay all
premiums on policies required hereunder as they become due and payable and
promptly deliver to Mortgagee evidence satisfactory to Mortgagee of the timely
payment thereof. If any loss occurs at any time when Mortgagor has failed to
perform Mortgagor&#146;s covenants and agreements in this paragraph with respect to
any insurance payable because of loss sustained to any part of the Property
whether or not such insurance is required by Mortgagee, Mortgagee shall
nevertheless be entitled to the benefit of all insurance covering the loss and
held by or for Mortgagor, to the same extent as if it had been made payable to
Mortgagee. Upon any foreclosure hereof or transfer of title to the Property in
extinguishment of the whole or any part of the Secured Indebtedness, all of
Mortgagor&#146;s right, title and interest in and to the insurance policies referred
to in this Section (including unearned premiums) and all proceeds payable
thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at foreclosure or other such
transferee, to the </FONT></P>

right
(but not the obligation) to make proof of loss for, settle and adjust any claim
under, and receive the proceeds of, all insurance for loss of or damage to the
Property where the loss is estimated by Mortgagee to be $1,000,000 or more,
regardless of whether or not such insurance policies are required by Mortgagee,
and the expenses incurred by Mortgagee in the adjustment and collection of
insurance proceeds shall be a part of the Secured Indebtedness and shall be due
and payable to Mortgagee on demand. Mortgagee shall not be, under any
circumstances, liable or responsible for failure to collect or exercise
diligence in the collection of any of such proceeds or for the obtaining,
maintaining or adequacy of any insurance or for failure to see to the proper
application of any amount paid over to Mortgagor. Any such proceeds received by
Mortgagee shall, after deduction therefrom of all reasonable expenses actually
incurred by Mortgagee, including attorneys&#146; fees, at Mortgagee&#146;s option be (1)
released to Mortgagor, or (2) applied (upon compliance with such terms and
conditions as may be required by Mortgagee) to repair or restoration, either
partly or entirely, of the Property so damaged, or (3) applied to the payment
of the Secured Indebtedness in such order and manner as Mortgagee, in its sole
discretion, may elect, whether or not due. In any event, the unpaid portion of
the Secured Indebtedness shall remain in full force and effect and the payment
thereof shall not be excused. Mortgagor shall at all times comply with the
requirements of the insurance policies required hereunder and of the issuers of
such policies and of any board of fire underwriters or similar body as

<U>Application
of Insurance Proceeds</U>.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the preceding
Section 2.1(d), if the Property is damaged or destroyed and Mortgagee
determines that all of the conditions specified hereinafter in this Section
have been satisfied, then Mortgagee shall apply the proceeds of insurance (i)
first to reimbursing itself for all costs incurred by it in the collection of
such proceeds and (ii) second to reimbursing Mortgagor for such actual costs as
shall have been incurred by Mortgagor in restoring the Property and shall be
approved by Mortgagee. Insurance proceeds shall be applied to such restoration
solely if (A) Mortgagee determines that: (i) the Property is capable of being
suitably restored in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements to the
value, condition, character and general utility existing prior to such damage
or destruction, and, in any event, to a Loan to Value Ratio of not greater than
70%, provided that this clause (i) shall not apply to insurance proceeds
relating to a casualty for which the gross insurance proceeds do not exceed
$1,000,000; (ii) sufficient funds are unconditionally available (from proceeds
of insurance and/or from funds of Mortgagor) to enable Mortgagor promptly to
commence, and thereafter diligently to prosecute to completion, such
restoration, provided that this clause (ii) shall not apply to insurance
proceeds relating to a casualty for which the gross insurance proceeds do not
exceed $1,000,000; (iii) Mortgagor is not in default or in breach of any
obligations under any Loan Document, no uncured Default exists under any Loan
Document and no facts or circumstances exist that would constitute a Default
with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both; and (iv) neither the
validity, enforceability nor priority of the lien of this Mortgage shall be
adversely affected; (B) Mortgagor has entered into a written agreement,
satisfactory in form and substance to Mortgagee, containing such conditions to
disbursements as are employed at the time by Mortgagee for construction loans;
(C) Mortgagor has delivered to Mortgagee such security as Mortgagee might have
reasonably required to assure completion of restoration in accordance with the
standards specified above; and (D) Mortgagor has complied with such further
reasonable requirements as Mortgagee might have specified.</FONT></P>

<U>Reserve
for Insurance, Taxes and Assessments</U>. Upon request of Mortgagee, to secure
the payment and performance of the Secured Indebtedness, but not in lieu of
such payment and performance, Mortgagor will deposit with Mortgagee a sum equal
to real estate taxes, assessments and charges (which charges for the purposes
of this paragraph shall include without limitation any recurring charge which
could result in a lien against the Property) against the Property for the
current year and the premiums for such policies of insurance for the current
year, all as estimated by Mortgagee and prorated to the end of the calendar
month following the month during which Mortgagee&#146;s request is made, and
thereafter will deposit with Mortgagee, on each date when an installment of
principal and/or interest is due on the Note, sufficient funds (as estimated
from time to time by Mortgagee) to permit Mortgagee to pay at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the due date thereof, the next maturing real estate taxes,
assessments and charges and premiums for such policies of insurance. Mortgagee
shall have the right to rely upon tax information furnished by applicable
taxing authorities in the payment of such taxes or assessments and shall have
no obligation to make any protest of any such taxes or assessments. Any excess
over the amounts required for such purposes shall be held by Mortgagee for
future use, applied to any Secured Indebtedness or refunded to Mortgagor, at
Mortgagee&#146;s option, and any deficiency in such funds so deposited shall be made
up by Mortgagor upon demand of Mortgagee. All such funds so deposited shall
bear no interest, may be commingled with the general funds of Mortgagee and
shall be applied by Mortgagee toward the payment of such taxes, assessments,
charges and premiums when statements therefor are presented to Mortgagee by
Mortgagor (which statements shall be presented by Mortgagor to Mortgagee a
reasonable time before the applicable amount is due); provided, however, that,
if a Default shall have occurred hereunder, such funds may at Mortgagee&#146;s
option be applied to the payment of the Secured Indebtedness in the order
determined by Mortgagee in its sole discretion, and that Mortgagee may (but
shall have no obligation) at any time, in its discretion, apply all or any part
of such funds toward the payment of any such taxes, assessments, charges or
premiums which are past due, together with any penalties or late charges with
respect thereto. The conveyance or transfer of Mortgagor&#146;s interest in the
Property for any reason (including without limitation the foreclosure of a
subordinate lien or security interest or a transfer by operation of law) shall
constitute an assignment or transfer of Mortgagor&#146;s interest in and rights to
such funds held by Mortgagee under this paragraph but subject to the rights of
Mortgagee hereunder.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <U>Condemnation</U>.
Mortgagor shall notify Mortgagee immediately of any threatened or pending
proceeding for condemnation affecting the Property or arising out of damage to
the Property, and Mortgagor shall, at Mortgagor&#146;s expense, diligently prosecute
any such proceedings. Mortgagee shall have the right (but not the obligation)
to participate in any such proceeding and to be represented by counsel of its
own choice. Mortgagee shall be entitled to receive all sums which may be
awarded or become payable to Mortgagor for the condemnation of the Property, or
any part thereof, for public or quasi-public use, or by virtue of private sale
in lieu thereof, and any sums which may be awarded or become payable to
Mortgagor for injury or damage to the Property. Mortgagor shall, promptly upon
request of Mortgagee, execute such additional assignments and other documents
as may be necessary from time to time to permit such participation and to
enable Mortgagee to collect and receipt for any such sums. All such sums are
hereby assigned to Mortgagee, and shall, after deduction therefrom of all
reasonable expenses actually incurred by Mortgagee, including attorneys&#146; fees,
at Mortgagee&#146;s option be (1) released to Mortgagor, or (2) applied (upon
compliance with such terms and conditions as may be required by Mortgagee) to

under any circumstances, liable or responsible for failure to collect or to

the proper application of any amount paid over to Mortgagor. Mortgagee is
hereby authorized, in the name of Mortgagor, to execute and deliver valid
acquittances for, and to appeal from, any such award, judgment or decree. All
costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by
Mortgagee in connection with any condemnation shall be a demand obligation

pursuant to this Mortgage. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) <U>Compliance
with Legal Requirements</U>. The Property and the use, operation and
maintenance thereof and all activities thereon do and shall at all times comply
with all applicable Legal Requirements (hereinafter defined). The Property is
not, and shall not be, dependent on any other property or premises or any
interest therein other than the Property to fulfill any requirement of any
Legal Requirement. Mortgagor shall not, by act or omission, permit any building
or other improvement not subject to the lien of this Mortgage to rely on the
Property or any interest therein to fulfill any requirement of any Legal
Requirement. No improvement upon or use of any part of the Property constitutes
a nonconforming use under any zoning law or similar law or ordinance. Mortgagor
has obtained and shall preserve in force all requisite zoning, utility,
building, health, environmental and operating permits from the governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over the Property. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
Mortgagor receives a notice or claim from any person that the Property, or any
use, activity, operation or maintenance thereof or thereon, is not in
compliance with any Legal Requirement, Mortgagor will promptly furnish a copy
of such notice or claim to Mortgagee. Mortgagor has received no notice and has
no knowledge of any such noncompliance. As used in this Mortgage: (i) the term
&#147;Legal Requirement&#148; means any Law (hereinafter defined), agreement, covenant,
restriction, easement or condition (including, without limitation of the
foregoing, any condition or requirement imposed by any insurance or surety
company), as any of the same now exists or may be changed or amended or come
into effect in the future; and (ii) the term &#147;Law&#148; means any federal, state or
local law, statute, ordinance, code, rule, regulation, license, permit,
authorization, decision, order, injunction or decree, domestic or foreign. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <U>Maintenance,
Repair and Restoration</U>. Mortgagor will keep the Property in first class
order, repair, operating condition and appearance, causing all necessary
repairs, renewals, replacements, additions and improvements to be promptly
made, and will not allow any of the Property to be misused, abused or wasted or
to deteriorate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mortgagor will not, without the
prior written consent of Mortgagee, (i) remove from the Property any fixtures
or personal property covered by this Mortgage except such as is replaced by
Mortgagor by an article of equal suitability and value, owned by Mortgagor,
free and clear of any lien or security interest (except that created by this
Mortgage), or (ii) make any structural alteration to the Property or any other
alteration thereto which impairs the value thereof. If any act or occurrence of
any kind or nature (including any condemnation or any casualty for which
insurance was not obtained or obtainable) shall result in damage to or loss or
destruction of the Property, Mortgagor shall give prompt notice thereof to
Mortgagee and Mortgagor shall promptly, at Mortgagor&#146;s sole cost and expense

or failure to act, acquiesce in the placing of, or allow to remain, any
mortgage, voluntary or involuntary lien, whether statutory, constitutional or

legal name is correctly set forth at the end of this Mortgage. If Mortgagor is
not an individual, Mortgagor is an organization of the type and (if not an
unregistered entity) is incorporated in or organized under the laws of the
state specified in the introductory paragraph of this Mortgage. If Mortgagor is
an unregistered entity (including, without limitation, a general partnership)
it is organized under the laws of the state specified in the introductory
paragraph of this Mortgage. Mortgagor will not cause or permit any change to be
made in its name, identity (including its trade name or names), or corporate or
partnership structure, unless Mortgagor shall have notified Mortgagee in
writing of such change at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of
such change, and shall have first taken all action required by Mortgagee for
the purpose of further perfecting or protecting the lien and security interest
of Mortgagee in the Property. In addition, Mortgagor shall not change its
corporate or partnership structure without first obtaining the prior written
consent of Mortgagee. Mortgagor&#146;s principal place of business and chief
executive office, and the place where Mortgagor keeps its books and records,

if less, the entire period of the existence of Mortgagor) been and will
continue to be (unless Mortgagor notifies Mortgagee of any change in writing at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date of such change) the address of
Mortgagor set forth at the end of this Mortgage. If Mortgagor is an individual,
Mortgagor&#146;s principal residence has for the preceding four months been and will

principal residence of Mortgagor set forth at the end of this Mortgage.
Mortgagor&#146;s organizational identification number, if any, assigned by the state

2.3. <U>Absence of Obligations of Mortgagee with Respect to Property</U>.
Notwithstanding anything in this Mortgage to the contrary, including, without
limitation, the definition of &#147;Property&#148; and/or the provisions of Article 3
hereof, (i) to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Property is composed
of Mortgagor&#146;s rights, title and interests therein but not Mortgagor&#146;s
obligations, duties or liabilities pertaining thereto, (ii) Mortgagee neither
assumes nor shall have any obligations, duties or liabilities in connection
with any portion of the items described in the definition of &#147;Property&#148; herein,
either prior to or after obtaining title to such Property, whether by
foreclosure sale, the granting of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise,
and (iii) Mortgagee may, at any time prior to or after the acquisition of title
to any portion of the Property as above described, advise any party in writing
as to the extent of Mortgagee&#146;s interest therein and/or expressly disaffirm in
writing any rights, interests, obligations, duties and/or liabilities with
respect to such Property or matters related thereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that Mortgagee shall
have no obligations, duties or liabilities prior to or after acquisition of
title to any portion of the Property, as lessee under any lease or purchaser or
seller under any contract or option unless Mortgagee elects otherwise by
written notification. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
2.4. <U>Authorization to File Financing Statements; Power of Attorney</U>.
Mortgagor hereby authorizes Mortgagee at any time and from time to time to file
any initial financing statements, amendments thereto and continuation
statements as authorized by applicable law, required by Mortgagee to establish
or maintain the validity, perfection and priority of the security interests
granted in this Mortgage. For purposes of such filings, Mortgagor agrees to
furnish any information requested by Mortgagee promptly upon request by Mortgagee.
Mortgagor also ratifies its authorization for Mortgagee to have filed any like
initial financing statements, amendments thereto or continuation statements if
filed prior to the date of this Mortgage. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably
constitutes and appoints Mortgagee and any officer or agent of Mortgagee, with
full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full
irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of Mortgagor or in
Mortgagor&#146;s own name to execute in Mortgagor&#146;s name any such documents and to
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Section 2.4, to the extent that
Mortgagor&#146;s authorization above is not sufficient. To the extent permitted by
law, Mortgagor hereby ratifies all acts said attorney-in-fact shall lawfully do,
have done in the past or cause to be done in the future by virtue hereof. This
power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><U>Assignment of Rents and Leases</U></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
3.1. <U>Assignment</U>. Mortgagor hereby assigns to Mortgagee all Rents
(hereinafter defined) and all of Mortgagor&#146;s rights in and under all Leases
(hereinafter defined). So long as no Default (hereinafter defined) has
occurred, Mortgagor shall have a license (which license shall terminate automatically
and without further notice upon the occurrence of a Default) to collect, but
not prior to accrual, the Rents under the Leases and, where applicable,
subleases, such Rents to be held in trust for Mortgagee, and to otherwise deal
with all Leases as permitted by this Mortgage. Each month, provided no Default
has occurred, Mortgagor may retain such Rents as were collected that month and
held in trust for Mortgagee; provided, however, that all Rents collected by
Mortgagor shall be applied solely to the ordinary and necessary expenses of
owning and operating the Property or paid to Mortgagee. Upon the revocation of
such license, all Rents shall be paid directly to Mortgagee and not through the
Mortgagor, all without the necessity of any further action by Mortgagee,
including, without limitation, any action to obtain possession of the Land,
Improvements or any other portion of the Property or any action for the
appointment of a receiver. Mortgagor hereby authorizes and directs the tenants
under the Leases to pay Rents to Mortgagee upon written demand by Mortgagee,
without further consent of Mortgagor, without any obligation of such tenants to
determine whether a Default has in fact occurred and regardless of whether
Mortgagee has taken possession of any portion of the Property, and the tenants
may rely upon any written statement delivered by Mortgagee to the tenants. Any
such payments to Mortgagee shall constitute payments to Mortgagor under the
Leases, and Mortgagor hereby irrevocably appoints Mortgagee as its
attorney-in-fact to do all things, after a Default, which Mortgagor might
otherwise do with respect to the Property and the Leases thereon, including,
without limitation, (i) collecting Rents with or without suit and applying the
same, less expenses of collection, to any of the obligations secured hereunder
or to expenses of operating and maintaining the Property (including reasonable
reserves for anticipated expenses), at the option of the Mortgagee, all in such
manner as may be determined by Mortgagee, or at the option of Mortgagee,
holding the same as security for the payment of the Secured Indebtedness, (ii)
leasing, in the name of Mortgagor, the whole or any part of the Property which
may become vacant, and (iii) employing agents therefor and paying such agents
reasonable compensation for their services. The curing of such Default, unless
other Defaults also then exist, shall entitle Mortgagor to recover its
aforesaid license to do any such things which Mortgagor might otherwise do with
respect to the Property and the Leases thereon and to again collect such Rents.
The powers and rights granted in this paragraph shall be in addition to the
other remedies herein provided for upon the occurrence of a Default and may be
exercised independently of or concurrently with any of said remedies. Nothing
in the foregoing shall be construed to impose any obligation upon Mortgagee to
exercise any power or right granted in this paragraph or to assume any
liability under any Lease of any part of the Property and no liability shall
attach to Mortgagee for failure or inability to collect any Rents under any
such Lease. The assignment contained in this Section shall become null and void
upon the release of this Mortgage. As used herein: (i) &#147;Lease&#148; means each
existing or future lease, sublease (to the extent of Mortgagor&#146;s rights
thereunder) or other agreement under the terms of which any person has or
acquires any right to occupy or use the Property, or any part thereof, or
interest therein, and each existing or future guaranty of payment or
performance thereunder, and all extensions, renewals, modifications and
replacements of each such lease, </FONT></P>

rents, revenue, income, profits and proceeds derived and to be derived from the
Property or arising from the use or enjoyment of any portion thereof or from
any Lease, including but not limited to the proceeds from any negotiated lease
termination or buyout of such Lease, liquidated damages following default under
any such Lease, all proceeds payable under any policy of insurance covering
loss of rents resulting from untenantability caused by damage to any part of
the Property, all of Mortgagor&#146;s rights to recover monetary amounts from any
tenant in bankruptcy including, without limitation, rights of recovery for use
and occupancy and damage claims arising out of Lease defaults, including
rejections, under any applicable Debtor Relief Law (hereinafter defined),
together with any sums of money that may now or at any time hereafter be or
become due and payable to Mortgagor by virtue of any and all royalties,
overriding royalties, bonuses, delay rentals and any other amount of any kind
or character arising under any and all present and all future oil, gas, mineral
and mining leases covering the Property or any part thereof, and all proceeds
and other amounts paid or owing to Mortgagor under or pursuant to any and all

in a Permitted Encumbrance, no Rents or Leases have been or will be assigned,
mortgaged, pledged or otherwise encumbered and no other person has or will
acquire any right, title or interest in such Rents or Leases; (e) no Rents have
been waived, released, discounted, set off or compromised; (f) except as stated
in the Leases, Mortgagor has not received any funds or deposits from any tenant
for which credit has not already been made on account of accrued Rents; (g)
Mortgagor shall perform all of its obligations under the Leases and enforce the
tenants&#146; obligations under the Leases to the extent enforcement is prudent
under the circumstances; (h) Mortgagor will not without the prior written
consent of Mortgagee, enter into any Lease after the date hereof except in

less), or settle or compromise any claim against a tenant under a Lease in
bankruptcy or otherwise (except with respect to leases of 15,000 square feet of
rentable space or less); (i) Mortgagor will not, without the prior written
consent of Mortgagee, terminate or consent to the cancellation or surrender of
any Lease having an unexpired term of one (1) year or more unless promptly
after the cancellation or surrender a new Lease of such premises is made with a
new tenant having a credit standing that is satisfactory to Mortgagee, in
Mortgagee&#146;s judgment, on terms not materially less favorable to lessor than the
terms of the terminated or cancelled Lease; (j) </FONT></P>

subtenant under or with respect to a Lease regarding any claimed damage,

unilaterally subordinate the lien of this Mortgage to any Lease, without
joinder or consent of, or notice to, Mortgagor, any tenant or any other person,

to any Lease. </FONT></P>

Mortgagee may grant with respect to any Secured Indebtedness, or any surrender,
compromise, release, renewal, extension, exchange or substitution which Mortgagee

security rights of Mortgagee hereunder or affect the liability of Mortgagor or
of any endorser, guarantor or surety, or improve the right of any junior lien
Mortgagee in the Property (without implying hereby Mortgagee&#146;s consent to any
junior lien).</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>Indebtedness or any part thereof) upon or after any default shall be
construed as a waiver of such default or as a waiver of the right to exercise
any such right, power or remedy at a later date. No single or partial exercise
by Mortgagee of any right, power or remedy hereunder shall exhaust the same or
shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof, and every such right,
power or remedy hereunder may be exercised at any time and from time to time.
No modification or waiver of any provision hereof nor consent to any departure
by Mortgagor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by Mortgagee and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance, for the purpose for which given and to
the extent therein specified. No notice to nor demand on Mortgagor in any case
shall of itself entitle Mortgagor to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances. Remittances in payment of any part of the
Secured Indebtedness other than in the required amount in immediately available
U.S. funds shall not, regardless of any receipt or credit issued therefor,
constitute payment until the required amount is actually received by Mortgagee
in immediately available U.S. funds and shall be made and accepted subject to
the condition that any check or draft may be handled for collection in
accordance with the practice of the collecting bank or banks. Acceptance by
Mortgagee of any payment in an amount less than the amount then due on any
Secured Indebtedness shall be deemed an acceptance on account only and shall
not in any way excuse the existence of a default hereunder notwithstanding any

notation on or accompanying such partial payment to the contrary.</FONT></P>

6.7. <U>Mortgagor&#146;s Successors</U>. If the ownership of the Property or any
part thereof becomes vested in a person other than Mortgagor, Mortgagee may,
without notice to Mortgagor, deal with such successor or successors in interest
with reference to this Mortgage and to the Secured Indebtedness in the same
manner as with Mortgagor, without in any way vitiating or discharging
Mortgagor&#146;s liability hereunder or for the payment of the indebtedness or
performance of the obligations secured hereby. No transfer of the Property, no
forbearance on the part of Mortgagee, and no extension of the time for the
payment of the Secured Indebtedness given by Mortgagee shall operate to
release, discharge, modify, change or affect, in whole or in part, the
liability of Mortgagor hereunder for the payment of the indebtedness or
performance of the obligations secured hereby or the liability of any other
person hereunder for the payment of the indebtedness secured hereby. Each
Mortgagor agrees that it shall be bound by any modification of this Mortgage or
any of the other Loan Documents made by Mortgagee and any subsequent owner of
the Property, with or without notice to such Mortgagor, and no such
modifications shall impair the obligations of such Mortgagor under this
Mortgage or any other Loan Document. Nothing in this Section or elsewhere in
this Mortgage shall be construed to imply Mortgagee&#146;s consent to any transfer
of the Property.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.8. <U>Place of Payment</U>. All Secured Indebtedness which may be owing

indicated at the end of this Mortgage). </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.9. <U>Subrogation to Existing Liens; Vendor&#146;s Lien</U>. To the extent that
proceeds of the Note are used to pay indebtedness secured by any outstanding
lien, security interest, charge or prior encumbrance against the Property, such
proceeds have been advanced by Mortgagee at Mortgagor&#146;s request, and Mortgagee
shall be subrogated to any and all rights, security interests and liens owned
by any owner or Mortgagee of such outstanding liens, security interests,
charges or encumbrances, however remote, irrespective of whether said liens,

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>interests, charges or encumbrances are released, and all of the same
are recognized as valid and subsisting and are renewed and continued and merged
herein to secure the Secured Indebtedness, but the terms and provisions of this
Mortgage shall govern and control the manner and terms of enforcement of the
liens, security interests, charges and encumbrances to which Mortgagee is
subrogated hereunder. It is expressly understood that, in consideration of the
payment of such indebtedness by Mortgagee, Mortgagor hereby waives and releases
all demands and causes of action for offsets and payments in connection with
the said indebtedness. If all or any portion of the proceeds of the loan
evidenced by the Note or of any other secured indebtedness has been advanced
for the purpose of paying the purchase price for all or a part of the Property,
no vendor&#146;s lien is waived; and Mortgagee shall have, and is hereby granted, a
vendor&#146;s lien on the Property as cumulative additional security for the secured
indebtedness. Mortgagee may foreclose under this Mortgage or under the vendor&#146;s
lien without waiving the other or may foreclose under both.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.10. <U>Application of Payments to Certain Indebtedness</U>. If any part of
the Secured Indebtedness cannot be lawfully secured by this Mortgage or if any
part of the Property cannot be lawfully subject to the lien and security
interest hereof to the full extent of such indebtedness, then all payments made
shall be applied on said indebtedness first in discharge of that portion
thereof which is not secured by this Mortgage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
6.11. <U>Nature of Loan; Compliance with Usury Laws</U>. The loan evidenced by
the Note is being made solely for the purpose of carrying on or acquiring a
business or commercial enterprise. It is the intent of Mortgagor and Mortgagee
and all other parties to the Loan Documents to conform to and contract in
strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. All
agreements between Mortgagee and Mortgagor (or any other party liable with
respect to any indebtedness under the Loan Documents) are hereby limited by the
provisions of this Section which shall override and control all such
agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising. In no way, nor in any
event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment, default, demand
for payment, or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the
interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, chargeable, or received
under this Mortgage, the Note or any other Loan Document or otherwise, exceed
the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law (the &#147;Maximum
Amount&#148;). If, from any possible construction of any document, interest would
otherwise be payable in excess of the Maximum Amount, any such construction
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and such document shall ipso
facto be automatically reformed and the interest payable shall be automatically
reduced to the Maximum Amount, without the necessity of execution of any
amendment or new document. If Mortgagee shall ever receive anything of value
which is characterized as interest under applicable law and which would apart
from this provision be in excess of the Maximum Amount, an amount equal to the
amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be
applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Secured
Indebtedness in the inverse order of its maturity and not to the payment of
interest, or refunded to Mortgagor or the other payor thereof if and to the
extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid
principal. The right to accelerate maturity of the Note or any other Secured
Indebtedness does not include the right to accelerate any interest which has
not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and Mortgagee does not
intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of acceleration.
All interest paid or agreed to be paid to Mortgagee shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full stated
term (including any renewal or extension) of such indebtedness so that the
amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum
Amount. As used in this Section, the term &#147;applicable law&#148; shall mean the laws
of the State of New York or the federal laws of the United States applicable to
this transaction, whichever laws allow the greater interest, as such laws now
exist or may be changed or amended or come into effect in the future.</FONT></P>

same becomes due and payable and all of the covenants, warranties, undertakings
and agreements made in this Mortgage are kept and performed, and all Swap
Transactions and all other obligations, if any, of Mortgagee for further
advances have been terminated, then, and in that event only, all rights under
this Mortgage shall terminate (except to the extent expressly provided herein
with respect to indemnifications, representations and warranties and other
rights which are to continue following the release hereof) and the Property
shall become wholly clear of the liens, security interests, conveyances and
assignments evidenced hereby, and such liens and security interests shall be
released by Mortgagee in due form at Mortgagor&#146;s cost. Without limitation, all
provisions herein for indemnity of Mortgagee or Mortgagee shall survive
discharge of the Secured Indebtedness, the termination of any and all Swap
Transactions and any foreclosure, release or termination of this Mortgage.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<U>Partial Releases; No Release in Default</U>. Partial releases of the lien of
this Mortgage shall be made in accordance with the terms and provisions of <U>Exhibit
C</U> attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof, or in
accordance with such other terms and conditions as may subsequently be agreed
to by Mortgagee. If no such <U>Exhibit C</U> is attached hereto, then there are
no terms and provisions for partial releases, to which Mortgagee and Mortgagor
have agreed at this time. In any event, no partial release shall be sought,
requested or required if any Default has occurred which has not been cured.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
<U>Effect of Partial Release</U>. Mortgagee may, regardless of consideration,

Mortgagee, at the time of each partial or complete release of the lien of this
Mortgage, a release fee in the amount of $25.00 if the release instrument is
delivered to Mortgagee for execution or $50.00, if Mortgagee is required to
prepare the release instrument. In addition, Mortgagor shall pay to Mortgagee a
fee in the amount of $25.00 for each other document or instrument which
Mortgagor requires the Mortgagee to execute.</FONT></P>

Guarantor shall, on demand and without presentment, protest, notice of protest,
further notice of nonpayment or of dishonor, default or nonperformance, or
notice of acceleration or of intent to accelerate, or any other notice
whatsoever, without any notice having been given to Guarantor previous to such
demand of the acceptance by Administrative Agent and/or Lenders of this
Guaranty, and without any notice having been given to Guarantor previous to
such demand of the creating or incurring of such indebtedness or of such
obligation to perform, all such notices being hereby waived by Guarantor, pay
the amount due to Administrative Agent or perform or observe the agreement,
covenant, term or condition, as the case may be, and pay all damages and all
costs and expenses that may arise in consequence of such Event of Default
(including, without limitation, all attorneys&#146; fees and expenses, investigation
costs, court costs, and any and all other costs and expenses incurred by
Administrative Agent in connection with the collection and enforcement of the
Note, this Guaranty or any other Loan Document), whether or not suit is filed
thereon, or whether at maturity or by acceleration, or whether before or after
maturity, or whether in connection with bankruptcy, insolvency or appeal. It
shall not be necessary for Administrative Agent, in order to enforce such
payment or performance by Guarantor, first to institute suit or pursue or
exhaust any rights or remedies against Borrower or others liable on such
indebtedness or for such performance, or to enforce any rights against any
security that shall ever have been given to secure such indebtedness or
performance, or to join Borrower or any others liable for the payment or
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof in any action to
enforce this Guaranty, or to resort to any other means of obtaining payment or
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations; provided, however, that nothing
herein contained shall prevent Administrative Agent from suing on the Note or
foreclosing the Mortgage or from exercising any other rights thereunder, and if
such foreclosure or other remedy is availed of, only the net proceeds therefrom,
after deduction of all charges and expenses of every kind and nature
whatsoever, shall be applied in reduction of the amount due on the Note and
Mortgage, and Administrative Agent shall not be required to institute or
prosecute proceedings to recover any deficiency as a condition of payment
hereunder or enforcement hereof. At any sale of the Property or other
collateral given for the Indebtedness or any part thereof, whether by
foreclosure or otherwise, Administrative Agent may at its discretion purchase
all or any part of the Property or collateral so sold or offered for sale for
its own account and may, in payment of the amount bid therefor, deduct such
amount from the balance due it pursuant to the terms of the Note, Mortgage and
other Loan Documents. </FONT></P>

Agent and/or Lenders is held to constitute a preference, fraudulent transfer or
other voidable payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or if
for any other reason Administrative Agent and/or Lenders is required to refund
such payment or pay the amount thereof to any other party, such payment by
Borrower or any other party to Administrative Agent and/or Lenders shall not
constitute a release of Guarantor from any liability hereunder, and this

Administrative Agent and Lenders that the obligations and liabilities of
Guarantor hereunder are absolute and unconditional under any and all

paid and performed, and not subject to refund or disgorgement, the obligations
and liabilities of Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or released, in
whole or in part, by any act or occurrence that might, but for the provisions
of this Guaranty, be deemed a legal or equitable discharge or release of a

which any performance of obligations under the Environmental Agreement shall

Guaranty, shall for all purposes be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York and applicable United States federal
law, and is intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent
permitted by, such laws. If any Guarantor is a corporation, the designation
&#147;(SEAL)&#148; on this Guaranty shall be effective as the affixing of such
Guarantor&#146;s corporate seal physically to this Guaranty. All obligations of
Guarantor hereunder are payable and performable at the place or places where
the Guaranteed Obligations are payable and performable. Guarantor hereby
irrevocably submits generally and unconditionally for Guarantor and in respect
of Guarantor&#146;s property to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any state court, or
any United States federal court, sitting in the state specified in the first
sentence of this Section and to the jurisdiction of any state or United States
federal court sitting in the state in which any of the Land is located, over
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty or
the Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection that Guarantor may now or hereafter have
to the laying of venue in any such court and any claim that any such court is
an inconvenient forum. Final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon Guarantor and
may be enforced in any court in which Guarantor is subject to jurisdiction.
Guarantor hereby agrees and consents that, in addition to any methods of
service of process provided for under applicable law, all service of process in
any such suit, action or proceeding in any state court, or any United States
federal court, sitting in the state specified in the first sentence of this
Section may be made by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
directed to Guarantor at the address set forth at the end of this Guaranty, or
at a subsequent address of which Administrative Agent receives actual notice
from Guarantor in accordance with the notice provisions hereof, and service so
made shall be complete five (5) days after the same shall have been so mailed.
Nothing herein shall affect the right of Administrative Agent to serve process
in any manner permitted by law or limit the right of Administrative Agent to
bring proceedings against Guarantor in any other court or jurisdiction. Guarantor
hereby releases, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all errors and all
rights of exemption, appeal, stay of execution, inquisition, and other rights
to which Guarantor may otherwise be entitled under the laws of the United

acceleration, or whether before or after maturity, or whether in connection
with bankruptcy, insolvency or appeal, or whether in connection with the collection
and enforcement of this Guaranty against any other Guarantor, if there be more
than one. Guarantor agrees to pay interest on any expenses or other sums due to
Administrative Agent and/or Lenders under this Section 11 that are not paid
when due, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate provided for in the

lawfully permitted to be paid by Guarantor under applicable law. Should it be
determined that any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other amount
payable by Guarantor under this Guaranty constitutes interest in excess of the
maximum amount of interest that Guarantor, in Guarantor&#146;s capacity as
guarantor, may lawfully be required to pay under applicable law, the obligation
of Guarantor to pay such interest shall automatically be limited to the payment
thereof in the maximum amount so permitted under applicable law. The provisions
of this Section 13 shall override and control all other provisions of this
Guaranty and of any other agreement between Guarantor, Administrative Agent and

<U>Cumulative Rights</U>. The exercise by Administrative Agent and/or Lenders
of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or at law or

other right or remedy. Administrative Agent and Lenders shall have all rights,
remedies and recourses afforded to Administrative Agent and Lenders by reason
of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document or by law or equity or otherwise,
and the same (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent, (b) may be pursued
separately, successively or concurrently against Guarantor or others obligated
for the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, or against any one or more
of them, or against any security or otherwise, at the sole and absolute
discretion of Administrative Agent, (c) may be exercised as often as occasion
therefor shall arise, it being agreed by Guarantor that the exercise of,
discontinuance of the exercise of or failure to exercise any of such rights,
remedies, or recourses shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release
thereof or of any other right, remedy, or recourse, and (d) are intended to be,
and shall be, nonexclusive. No waiver of any default on the part of Guarantor
or of any breach of any of the provisions of this Guaranty or of any other
document shall be considered a waiver of any other or subsequent default or
breach, and no delay or omission in exercising or enforcing the rights and
powers granted herein or in any other document shall be construed as a waiver
of such rights and powers, and no exercise or enforcement of any rights or
powers hereunder or under any other document shall be held to exhaust such
rights and powers, and every such right and power may be exercised from time to
time. The granting of any consent, approval or waiver by Administrative Agent
and/or Lenders shall be limited to the specific instance and purpose therefor
and shall not constitute consent or approval in any other instance or for any
other purpose. No notice to or demand on Guarantor in any case shall of itself
entitle Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances. No provision of this Guaranty or any right, remedy or recourse
of Administrative Agent and/or Lenders with respect hereto, or any default or
breach, can be waived, nor can this Guaranty or Guarantor be released or
discharged in any way or to any extent, except specifically in each case by a
